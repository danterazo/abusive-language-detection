 Why ref to AP arch. inscriptions and valuable historical books removed 

Dear Sitush,

You have asked about the independence of """"Andhra Kshatriyas History by Pencommunities.matsa Krishnam Raju, Kshatriya vamsa ratnamala""""
earlier in this talk page. Its strange how you follow a different standard when it comes to Kammas page where you have vilified a caste book (Kammavari charitra by KB Chowdary) which is more of a Caste book rather an independent author, as it is 
written by A kamma on Kamma caste.
I may not be a full timed wiki author/ contributor like you, but I do follow same rules for all wiki pages and communities. my only concern is you have been following double standards in Kamma page may be its your community.

Apart from Andhra Kshatriyas History book,
you have also removed content which had AP archaelogical inscription sentences (http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume10/kakatiya_dynasty_1.html) and 
sentences from Pg 174 The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi.

As you are the author for Kammas page plz be reminded that same rules apply for all pages, if some caste book can be taken as reference/citation, then can every other community can refer ther own community history books.
I request you to be fair to other communities also.

Hereby i am providing some valuable citations, others will be followed soon.

 RE: Maccabiah teams 

I understand what you mean. I myself was somewhat reluctant to add them to that section at first, exactly for the reason you have stated. I think it's a shame, however, to see the Maccabiah teams entirely out of the """"national"""" section of all the templates.

 Figures in the infobox... once again 

I found this:

The Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no German artillery in infobox at all).

Until recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100,000 in Berlin. The actual figures are unknown. Yet no less than 30,000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible. Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because Zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. Zhukov denied that allegation, stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a HOLE DAMN LOT more (Wikipedia now claims only 81,000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone). 

I'd like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35,000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.

Other source (modern Russian): The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 Soviet casualties. The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says """"134,000 captured"""")

Still another: However, it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin.8This number included killed, wounded and missing. Interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher. (...) Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear (infobox says """"81,000 killed"""", etc - while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)

How about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown? 

Also, Britannica about overall Soviet (unknown!) losses:

Available estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely. A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. These figures have been widely accepted in Germany, but most U.S. compilations, based on Soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 U.S.S.R. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in World War II. The figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the West.   """,0

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!

 Packerfansam 

Better to continue the discussion here, I think.

The ANI, in which we both participated, was closed out in June or so with no action, based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems she'd occasioned, and a promise to try to stop.  You'll recall that she had been removing references from articles to non-Christian religions and thought, sexual orientation, and sex generally, among other things; and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI, it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits.

As the matter wrapped up, I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem (she described it along the lines of """"offending one or two users"""") or that she'd actually quit the problematic editing, but after being characterized as """"overzealous"""" on the point, I withdrew.

She has slowed, but certainly not quit, her POV editing.  A partial list of such edits since then includes:

July 9
At Christianity, without explanation, she recast the “Criticism and apologetics” section as “Arguments and apologetics”, and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians, as well as a (sourced) observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth.

July 30
At Trois-Rivières, removed without explanation the identification of a (Canadian) Liberal Party politician as “liberal”, as well as a reference to another person’s being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased, without comment, mention of Hugh Hefner’s attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago.

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known (and described as) an LGBT activist.

October 15
At Ted Turner, she removed a reliably-sourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic, claiming it was “contradicted” by info elsewhere in article, when the excised information was more recent than the “contradictory” text and, indeed, nicely illustrated the point (in the source itself), which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years.

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned - see this Talk page entry from September.

I agree that the """"party school"""" edit to the University of Wisconsin is, in the larger picture, kind of a silly thing; but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from, she has made the same edit at least four times now - see May 15, June 13, October 3 in addition to today's.  And to be clear, she's not removing the """"party school"""" material but just the (perfectly good) citation to Playboy.  Indeed in her October 3 entry, she updated the """"party school"""" rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboy's stead.

So I take your point, that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on; but she has continued her practice (albeit slowed) of idiosyncratic, unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view.  I don't think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment, and that's what I did.    """,0

1) Ref #5 is handled...it no longer exists on the SpaceX site as far as I can tell, so I pulled from Archive.org.

In my opinion, all the newspacewatch.com articles should be replaced since they've gone completely paywall (I'll be surprised if they survive), even though I've added archive links to all four of those cites.
2) I'll come back and clean up various conversion issues (definitely SI before non-SI in space-related articles), but I didn't immediately see much in the way of spelling issues. There's some formatting work to be done, but doesn't seem too bad.
3) As for images...they simply don't exist at this point in time (SpaceX is, after all, a private company, and conducts their testing in-house).

  As for intel provided to Soviets: I'm fairly certain Churchill's selective provision of Ulta intel to the Soviets was strategically self-serving. Also, it's one thing to provide someone with intel that YOU surmise he needs, and another thing entirely to provide intel that he knows he needs. Far as article is concerned, the point is that 10 years after the article's first appearance, reliable Hinsley and Bennett remain conspicuously absent from references, (as is conspicuously absent from the article content the crucial matter of strategy per se); whereas there's a preponderence of minutae about mostly side-show issues, and what one editor has aptly described as """"crappy POV pushing references.""""

"Why is an article about a Greek Orthodox theological subject being dominated by an Roman Catholic editor?
Why is Esoglou making very disproportionate (at best) Roman Catholic additions to this article? 
Why is an article about a Greek philosophy and a Greek Orthodox concept (as it is used exclusively in the present) being dominated by the editor Esoglou? Why are there recent very long additions about people like Augustine whom in their writing never used the word (because Augustine could not speak nor read Greek). Being added to an article about the very essential difference between Roman Catholic and Orthodox theologies as specifically noted by scholars of Greek Orthodox theology?  
Why is Esoglou engaging in rewriting this article to say a concept that is almost exclusive spoken of in Greek?
Why to an article about a theological concept so important to Greek Orthodox Theology that is mentioned by Greek Orthodox theologians in that way. 
Why is the actual text for the Roman Catholic church now equal to or more that the Eastern Orthodox? Even though the concept is not spoken of by the RC church per se?
Why or what evidence is there to believe (outside of what anecdotal evidence Esoglou added) that theoria is now somehow something so Roman Catholic embraces in the way the Eastern Orthodox do?
Why is Esoglou using this concept's article to ATTACK Greek theologians (John Romanides)?
Why is it Esoglou could not make his edits to the article Contemplation instead? Since he uses the excuse that the term Contemplation is the same as theoria even though that is so vague as to miss the entire point of why Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S Romanides and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos use the term theoria instead of contemplation. *Why is it that it appears that Esoglou's edits confuse the whole point of the article and I can not find any Roman Catholic sources let alone encyclopedia and scholarly sources that treat this subject the way Esoglou has rewritten the article?
Why would it not seem that it is in Esoglou's best interest to discredit this theological subject because it contradicts his narrative that there is no fundamental difference between the Eastern Orthodox church and the Roman Catholic church. 
Why is it as the article is the specific difference it not to be believed that Esoglou is not POV pushing after he wrote this sentence in the article TODAY..
Contrary to what Romanides said, it is Roman Catholic teaching that God loves all, even those who choose against him, such as the devil. 
Why is in Esoglou's POV interest to either make the article incoherent, discredit the Orthodox theologians in the article or poison the well and have the article deleted wholesale?
Why (if anyone spends the time to read what has been said on this article talkpage) it is not clear that Esoglou's behavior has tried all of these things and is actively now ruining the article and running contributors off of the article as his recent reverting and rewriting of the contributions made by User:Timothy.lucas.jaeger show. 
Why does the article not reflection how this concept is being used and presented by Greek theologians but is now peppered with Esoglou's anecdotal original research? His speculation, opinions and interpretations? Why is allowed to do this to various wikipedia articles without even once being banned for an hour let alone 24 hours? LoveMonkey",0

As far as I know, the concept of readymades evolved from Dada ideas. Dada-ists used garbage, newspaper-clippings, Objets Trouvees as material to make art. The objet trouvee already contains the """"pop"""" idea of using everyday materials - like newspapers - instead of more classical materials - like paint and canvas.
Duchamp added to this concept by using readymades, he also gave the idea a theoretical context.
Warhol added to this development by using readymade concepts. He took a well-known concept, not necessarily its material representative, and made it the subject of his works. I would say that Warhol used ideas and images in a similar way that Duchamp used objects.
In other words, Warhol or Duchamp may or may not be credited with something, but their """"pointing and calling it art"""" is part of a development that didn't start or stop with their work.
Art-historians tend to talk about readymades as belonging to Duchamp. Warhol is credited for incorporating popular ideas and methods into art.

Notability of Poornima Dilip
 A tag has been placed on Poornima Dilip requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

"To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.
The development of sophisticated complex non-linearly driven four-group based designs (focusing, variator, compensator, relay master) is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques, computation algorithms, manufacturing — e.g. lower cost aspherical lenses, numerical control machines to manufacture precise non-linear driving cams — and material science — e.g. glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics.",0

 Whole Ariticle Needs to br Rewritten 

i believe this whole article needs to be rewritten fromntop to bottom.  In jumps around in a chronological sense, thereby notbshowingbin a cohesive way how improvisational theatre has developed.  There is a lot of text devoted to thevwork of Keith Jonstone, but his work is no more important than dozens of other writers; moreover, his importance is no where near as significant in the US as is the work of Spolin, Shepherd, Sills, and Close (and the rolenof IO and The Second City.

The article, in it's present form, looks like a hodge-podge of sentences and paragraphs from many authors with no attention paid to consistency.

A rewrite would also avoid some duplication.

How does one initiate such a process?  Who selects the person to take the first stab at it?  I would propose that Michael Golding of Los Angeles do the rewrite.  He has a masters degree in improvisation from NYU, personally knows many of the people who have created modern improvisational theatre (Shepherd, Sills, Close, Halpern to name a few), and is a professional writer (his latest credit is for writing the film """"David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre"""").  Any thoughts?""",0
"Oh please, stop talking nonsense and deceiving the world. During my long, VERY LONG research I foung NO pictures, no reliable sources, not anything!

I am sanctioned to give another 50 words of justification to any revert until the end of June so here it goes. Besides what I stated above, here are my thoughts: I have nothing contrary to the citation of a contemporary author that has done a serious study on Vojsava Tripalda and doesn't blindly repeat that she was from Serbian origin. The only contemporary scholar that we have to claim that Voisava Tripalda was from Serbian origin is Spandounes, who says only that, and then he points to the biography of Marin Barleti. Now Barleti doesn't say that she was Serbian, but Albanian, so Spandounes contradicts himself. If we really want to give some references to Skanderbeg that are sour, let's start with Oliver Jens Schmitt who really has made a bad biography of the national hero of the Albanians. Schmitt is a voice out of the choir and I would love if someone brings to the table what he says, because I want to see if he is fringe or serious. Let's talk  """,0

It's difficult to consider you a serious editor when you continually hide behind different anonymous IP addresses.  As stated previously by other editors, if you want to be considered a legitimate editor, register a name and sign your posts.  Otherwise, you may be considered only a disruptive vandal.  

 I've given consideration to your diatribe and find your arguments specious.  Obviously, you have an intense personal interest in extolling the virtues of ATF, and your threat to """"bury the criticism' is totally inappropriate.  Nevertheless, I've personally reviewed the section in question, and found it to be a bit cluttered with too many incidents of ATF individual corruption - which dilutes the impact.  Therefore, at this time, I won't revert your removal.

 ATF has many good agents and employees, and it does much good work.  However, the 'attaboy' side of the ledger seems now to be overwhelmed by the 'awshit' side - """"Fast and Furious"""" being a prime example.....

He thinks a community college newspaper is a credible source, and clings to a site like allmusic.com that is notorious for errors. When you call him out on anything like that, he ignores it and runs away. He doesn't even respond on the talk page when you want to discuss the addition or deletion of a band. You can never get anything done with him around. Those dispute resolution procedures won't do crap. He was banned for a day too and weasled his way out of it. I've never had a problem with anyone else on here. I'm not the only one that sees his self-imposed dictatorship on certain topics. My solution to avoiding him was making new articles and ignoring his. The articles I created were done no differently from the countless articles already on this site. He purposely went after them because I made them. How is it my fault when you have someone that controls all the edits of an article and then doesn't let anyone else make their own as well? He's trying to run things here.   """,0

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

Sure. What do you mean? I am in the process of writing a little welcome and how to. John, if you recall the minor dispute about the Estonia links really caught me off guard and I was a bit thin-skinned in taking criticism for what I thought was my helpful addition of a couple of links. I learned from that and other experiences here that practically every article has two sides, and that you can't just go in and naiively think you're adding objective information, when that info most likely has already been debated. I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.) They were quick to jump to that conclusion, I thought, based only on a few bits of info gleaned from my posts. Anyway, I'm trying to make it clear that I do not do anything on Wikipedia because of what I do for a living. And I wanted to point out, with the """"About me: Who cares"""", that I do not participate here to draw attention to myself or to please my employer.  

 BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view.

 Why confusion and controversy in the """"real world"""" does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out """"the truth"""" about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it.

I reject such a stance.  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial.  Where many Wikipedia editors """"get it wrong"""" is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth.  This is wrong.  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.

Instead of """"truth"""", Wikipedia aims for """"verifiability"""".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents """"THE TRUTH"""" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.

I have been trying to hit this NPOV """"sweet spot"""" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits. That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article. ≈talk≈ """,0

Currently the article does not convey the fact that a new Inquest into the Hillsboroguh Fans' deaths has begun. 

Changes to the article are likely to be actually controversial or be seen to be controversial for the next year or so, regardless of source. New facts may emerge into the public domain as a alarge amount of documentation has been made available to the Coroner. 

For this reason, Wikipedia Editors might be best seeking to lock editing for the duration and to seek expertise regarding how to edit without interfering with the Inquest.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by 82.40.44.174   

The above is probably one of many reasons why this article should be locked for editing, given the topic immediately above this one. This article has already been raised at WP:AN. Lets defer to the admins common sense and judgement for the time being  (attempt) 

Articles relating to high-profile court cases are not normally protected - see WP:PROTECT for policy. This is partly because this a private website based in the USA; the US and UK rules on freedom of speech during court cases are rather different and Wikipedia - like other organisations - doesn't take kindly to people outside the US trying to apply their rules to it.    Also, there are plenty of Wikipedia editors who are quick to remove material they see as inappropriate and 185 editors have this article on their watchlist. This can work very well - see above for how quickly the offensive material was removed from this article - so I expect the default will be to carry on as normal unless problems arise. If they do, there's a whole range of measures that include blocking particular editors from Wikipedia or barring brand new or unregistered editors.

Include """"it has been called a massacre"""". No bold. Not an alternative title. Just simply lay it out there. One editor recently provided a source calling it """"Massacre in Gaza"""". It was obviously referred to as a massacre. 
or
Include every title that was verifiably used in RS at a ratio of tens of thousands to one. This could be accomplished by actually adding information in the lead about the media and its relation t this topic. This would increase the quality of the article by meeting WP:LEAD] by being an actual summary. 
I'm not going to lie, I think it is time to change the title of this article altogether.  notice that other language's Wikipedia projects refer to it as the Israeli operational name (some editors have equated this to POV even though it is a very common and accurate title) or one laying out the dates and calling it a conflict (as we used to do but it was really long). That discussion will eventually come up again and any decision here will get scuttled by it (or the opposite). But it is clear that giving prominence to a very little used and POV dripping title in the lead is not acceptable to many editors without thoughtful balancing. Two easy options are presented to you. It is my hope that the word massacre is used in the lead but how to do it is a hurdle. And add on top of that that we still don't even have a good main title and it shows that this process has been broken since day 1. Day 1 was years ago.  03:16, 28""",0

 Why do procaryotic endospores get their own entry rather than being classified as a type of spore?  What is it about the definition of """"spore"""" that the bacterial kind doesn't meet?  Their sporulation and germination processes and triggering conditions are analogous to those of diploid eukaryotes, and the asymmetric fission leading to formation of an endospore is similarly analogous to that of the asymmetric division producing eucaryotic spores.

"Well, the only thing is that I can only make any sort of promises for myself; I can't guarantee that some other editor won't come along and strip the unsourced stuff out again anyway. The problem is that there've been quite a few major incidents on here in the past few years, with the consequence that we've had to really tighten up our content rules — we have to be a lot stricter now about what we can and can't include than we could get away with in 2005, because we're under a lot more pressure and scrutiny than we were back then. So we have to be a lot more careful now than we did five or six years ago — and unfortunately, sometimes that does also mean we have to delete stuff we previously could have kept. Truthfully, being actively involved around here is as much of a pain in the arse for us as it is for you — we're not trying to be mean or anything, but keeping things under control around here is practically a full-time job on a good day.

"Hi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a 'carry trade' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.

So let's say the hypothetical 'carry trader', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.

Now, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.

The 'real' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.
The 'real' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.

So, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%
And for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%

So the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called 'carry trade' should not have an expectation of profit.

Hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.

Therefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial 'media' or even in the 'Economist' about a so-called profitable 'carry trade' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable 'carry trade' defies logic.",0

Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences”. User:Bobrayner wipes out “surplus economics”, “archaeology”, “sociology” and “other social sciences” so that the  sentence now reads: “Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology” (in that case, it should really be “AND economic anthropology”). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a “quote farm” or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that “For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below).” There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out “the statement that “Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion.” For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence “The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour” and adds, “In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour.” But this doesn’t even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed,” then User:Bobrayner changes that to “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has",0

"Atabek again when you call Kasravi a pan-Iranian nationalists and not acceptable, then I can call Tapper an anthropologist which he is.  If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. 
 تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.
 Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.  
 As per Arbcomm, there are admins I can report personal attacks outside of there and thus I mentioned the warning.   I have no interest for getting personal as you said either.  So lets keep it professional.  Thanks",0

It depends upon the type of explosion.

"An alluvial plain is a relatively flat and gently sloping landform found at the base of a range of hills or mountains, formed by the deposition of alluvial soil over a long period of time by a rivers coming from the mountains.

As the hills erode due to weathering and water flow the sediment from the hills is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will over time seek new, lower paths, forming meanders (a curving sinuous path).

 A request 

I ask that you consider taking time away from posting on WT:V or the subpage. Your posts there, particularly the multiple polls, became disruptive several weeks ago, and the page has basically ground to a halt because of it. I took six weeks off from editing either the policy or the talk page—from around June 20 until August 7—just to make sure other people's voices were heard equally, so I hope you'll consider doing the same. If your proposals are truly supported, they won't be affected by your absence.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I agree that the main talk page needs a breather from this whole topic.  And I'm ready for quiet work on it in an obscure place for a while.  If you want that to not be the subpage, that's fine with me but I just said there that I went along with the subpage idea.  Sincerely,  North8000  

The main talk page needs a long, long breather. But I think you need a breather too from this topic, partly for your own sake, but also to see whether it has legs without you. At things stand, you're doing two things simultaneously (and in something of a contradiction): keeping it going, and strengthening opposition to it because of the overkill. If you would let it be, you would see whether it has legs of its own. Anyway, just a request.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

I'm ready to slip into low key """"homework"""" on this, even without a request.  Me suggesting that we adopt the first sentence just proposed/suggested by Jimbo Wales was a sort of special departure from that, I saw that as acting more as a facilitator.  I noticed that somebody tried to hide the fact that it was HIS suggestion by changing the section title. North8000  

But not before reverting and continuing to disrupt. You are posting an inherently POV poll; RfCs are supposed to be neutrally worded. I give up on you because it is pointless.  TALK|CONTRIBS 

 I don't think that it is POV to say who wrote the proposed wording.  That was the original title of the section, it's the title that people commented under, and it provides the information of who wrote it.   Since when in Wikipedia does saying the source of something get called """"POV'ing"""" it? And don't forget there is a second dimension to this.  I put up HIS suggestion, and people are removing the fact that it was HIS suggestion simultaneously with villianizing me for putting (it) up a suggestion on the first sentence.  I call that dirty pool.  But, as I said, I put it it up as a facilitator, and don't plan to further advocate it.  North8000  """,0

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her """"vanish"""" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate.

"""Balance==

I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he """"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"""" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  

It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.

I think one thing you have to be careful of in Wikipedia is that a claim is totally unsalvage-able before deleting it (some editors NEVER delete any claim from another user, even then).

Moneybomb (money bomb, money-bomb, fundraising bomb, Fawkes bomb) is a neologism used to describe a grassroots effort to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing and concentrating the candidate's fundraising activity during a specific hour or day. The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidate's notable success, if any.
The term was used as early as 2004, but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States, with its record-breaking fundraiser of November 5. The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates.

Origin
According to The Politico, the term was coined in 2007. The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th, Guy Fawkes Day. This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film, V for Vendetta, which depicted a modern-day fascist Parliament, overpowered by popular revolution that was led by """"V"""", a Fawkes-like character.

The 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented one-day online fundraiser in political history, bringing in over $4 million. On November 6, Ron Paul's campaign stated that in addition, the free media coverage after the event was worth well over $10 million.

The imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged, since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system, but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government, so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous. Paul's campaign spokesman Jesse Benton clarified to the New York Times that Paul does not support blowing up government buildings: """"He wants to demolish things like the Department of Education . . . but we can do that very pea",0

I noticed as a neutral observer your huge bias towards the 'Republic of Macedonia' throughout this whole page as well as the usual Greek brigade trying to defend their famous history now in the hands of a new owners. I have followed this whole case including the Arb where again you seem content to falsify history, this time claiming, 'the Gordian Knot was a greek mess solved by a Macedonian.' The Gordian Knot was not a Greek knot Taivo and I suggest you refer to the appropriate page on this encylopedia to understand why before misquoting history. Alexander the Great, a Greek in his own words unfortunately for your little example on the Arb page, solved the knot the same way Chris0 did, without a care and with the sword. It is offensive enough how bias you are on the whole issue while claiming neutrality (the only thing that really annoys me), at least Fut Perfect and Chris 0 are honest extreme nationalists to an extent. What exactly are you? It is sad in my view. This page has always been a battle ground, on the one hand, the usual Greeks editors tring to salvage their past for the world to remember them by, on the other the new fierce 'Macedonians' relying on neurtrals who do not fully understand the situation in the Balkans for support. This word Macedonia, clearly needs a disamiguation page as Michael Wood (historian) would argue as he believes, the Republic of Macedonia should not be confused with the word Macedonia, and Taivo, I feel with great assurance, he does know his history and politics on the matter. Thank you for your time and good luck with this nasty page of nationalism and invented meaning. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 79.123.62.178

""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0

The thing is, just because some nomenclature has a historical POV does not mean that it has a current POV.  For example, I can use the terms Holy Roman Empire, Thursday, or Queen Elizabeth II without implying that I believe that the empire was holy, or that I worship the Norse god of thunder, or that I recognize the authority of the British monarch.  (Interesting note about the Quakers in the Thursday article though: should we scrub Wikipedia of """"Thursday""""?)  Regardless of the historical origins of the abbreviations BC and AD, they now mean little more than indicating the point at which the English-speaking world stops counting years backward and starts counting them forward.  Seriously, how many people read """"BC"""" and think that the Messiahship of Jesus is being proclaimed?  Or that AD means they accept Jesus as Lord?  Construing BC and AD as statements of religious devotion may have been valid when the terms were first introduced, but to reject BC and AD now in the face of centuries of tradition and widespread usage seems to be justifiable only under two premises: either (1) that any term with historical origins in religious devotion carries an eternal POV taint and should be excised from Wikipedia, or (2) that the abbreviations still so strongly communicate religious meaning to the majority of users as to make the terminology indeed POV.  The first premise is itself POV (by singling out religion as an unacceptable originator of terminology), and thus should not justify rejecting BC/AD.  The second premise, though is where I think Slrubenstein and others are coming from (do correct me if I'm wrong).  If this premise can be validated, then the POV-ness of BC/AD is established, and use of these abbreviations should be abandoned throughout Wikipedia in favor of BCE/CE.  On the other hand, if BC/AD is shown not to convey religious meaning to the majority of Wikipedia users, then it should be the favored usage in most articles based on its familiarity to readers.  Perhaps another poll could be taken to address the simple yes/no question: Does modern usage of BC/AD convey a religious point of view to you?  Assuming a sufficiently representative response by Wikipedians, the results may be a better indication of how to resolve this controversy than simply asking for people's preferences between BC/AD and BCE/CE.

The idea drew such opposition that the King County Council eventually amended the county's comprehensive plan to specifically forbid such a roadway from cutting through the area.""""

Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0

Clearly, some have an emotional or economic interest in minimising or even denying the importance of these consumer-oriented blind tasting competitions: 

The Emperor Has No Clothes

The owners of 30 of  the best wines in the world, in the judgment of a Champagne company president, were invited to a party in 1997. The event was organized by Jean-Claude Rouzaud to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his presidency of Champagne Louis Roederer. Half of his selections were from France. """"I’m a chauvinist and a nationalist"""" he explained. 

""""Before agreeing to participate, the Bordeaux first growths set some conditions, the foremost being that no comparative tasting with their international competition would be held."""" They didn’t even want to be included in a group photo with their colleagues from other wine regions, although they finally reluctantly agreed.  """"But getting the Bordelais to have their wines served with the others', that was out of the question,"""" said a Roederer spokesperson.

So the event took place in two separate parts: first, a dinner featuring the Bordeaux wines; then a tasting the next day with all the other wines, but no Bordeaux. 

""""They are cowards,"""" said a non-Bordeaux producer.  But the host said  """"I understand them."""" He explained that  """"They feel that when you are first growths you are untouchable."""" Their problem is that they actually know better.

They and the other named growth vineyards have a carefully cultivated  image of  superiority. This is a marketing advantage worth an incredibly enormous sum of money every year. However, they frequently fail to perform well in blind comparisons and realize how vulnerable they are to exposure and the destruction of their vaulted  and very valuable reputations. 

Because of this the named growths  (1) want to avoid  comparisons  and (2) try to discredit  the results of such comparisons . Who can blame them? Those results can cost them a fortune in lost revenue. But the consumer benefits immensely.

Hi Bogdan. Regarding this your talk message: you can use the image request templates for filing standard images requests that will be automatically put to the respective category.

The addition does meet your requirements.  The bass player from The Steadys (Ani Schempfe a.k.a. DJ On-E) joined the pop group Dee-Lite in 1993 after The Steadys broke up.  This fits with you requirements if I'm not mistaken.  The Steadys are also on a live album called NYC SKA LIVE which was released in 1990, so there is physical proof (Recorded media) and this I believe also fits your requirements.  Thank you!

The warning that you 'dittoed' was for vandalism that I didn't commit (the person who did it had cracked the key to my wireless network, which was weak, and I had to change it).

If it is in the archives, it is not an ongoing discussion, and that comment about tags by Supreme Deliciousness did not even receive one response.

When I looked at this entry on p. 3-366 before, it looked like """"15"""". Also, on """"Explanation of Table"""" p. 3-2, I read
""""The data in the table have many sources, including both the primary literature and evaluated compilations.  The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28).""""
So this suggests that some temperature values in the table are automatically derived but as I say, the """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" is a raised, reduced-sized font, not parenthesized. So the superscript may well refer to alternate sample pressure - I can't find whatever it references. I apologize if this dwells on this source too much; I think the consensus here that the bp is significantly higher than 75'C is dispositive.

"Frivolous tempering with data by User:Antidote

If one opens Demographics of Bulgaria in NationMaster, one will see the wikipedia article 70 days exactly at the pointn when it was subject to vandalism by an anonomous user who frivolously (ha! it is not only Antidote who does such things but may be Antidote and anonymous are the same person???) tampered with the data from Census 2001. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much, Antidote for providing us with this extremely precious information. (Applause waited)

User:Antidote takes an estimate of the Factbook and calculates on his own ethnic distributions using the 2001 census up to the hundreds!!! How wise that is, my dear, I am thrilled!!! Has the thought that YOU MAY NOT DO OWN CALCULATIONS crossed your mind? Have you thought that ethnic distributions in 2001 may not be valid in 2005? What if the number of Bulgarians suddenly exploded? Or that it suddenly plunged? Ha???

So, the estimate of the Factbook... Some organisation based in Washington makes an estimation without giving any ground for its estimations, without being a statistics organization but User:Antidote thinks this is the best source he could take a 2005 estimate from. Well, the Factbook may be well-publiced but Brittney Spears is well-publicised, as well, and her music is shite. Look at these two links, the first one is the official estimate of Eurostat for 2005  (7,761,000), the other one is an encyclopedia quoting the official estimate of the UN for 2003  (7,897,000). These are REPUTABLE STATISTICS ORGANISATIONS and compared with them, the Factbook is worthless. Other questions, my dear?

@AynHaylo The Aramean movement is based on our real heritage and history, which forms this strong foundation! Your invented """"Assyrian"""" ethnic identity has no foundation among the Syriac Christians (Suryoye) before the 19th century. Once again, the Syriac-Orthodox Church has clearly its roots in the Aramean nation and can prove an Aramean ethnic identity by its chronicles, which goes hundreds of years back even before the 20th century, whereas the """"Assyrian"""" Church of the East can't prove its Assyrian identity before the 19th century. BTW we are actually known as Süryaniler in Turkish and as Syrianin in Arabic, both words mean Syrians, but refer to the Aramaic-speaking Christians. In Arabic you have two words for Syrian, but with different meanings. Moreover, the bible clearly distinguish between Syrians (Arameans) and Assyrians. Syrian is the Greek word for Aramean and this word was adopted by the Arameans in their mother tongue and they have called themselves Suryoye since then. I don't care about what other people call us. Most Germans call oriental-looking persons Turks and every black person is just an African. What matters is what we call ourselves. We have always called ourselves Suryoye (Syrians) and our origin is Aramaic, not pseudo Assyrian.

"""What I was saying was that South Africa was never a """"black"""" country. The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, """"independecne"""" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate. South Africa now has the highest murder, rape, armed assault, car theft, and child abuse statistics in the world. The HIV-infection and illegal narcotics statistics are rapidly catching up.

I am frustrated by the oblique nature of WP procedures.  You seem to be authoring Administrator Review procedures, so perhaps you can help in two ways.

First, I was drawn here trying to seek review of an administratorPMDrive1061 who deleted one of my articles.  I'm not keen on the back room ways WP operates, but I've certainly edited enough articles.  An article should go through an AfD procedure and be discusseddirect deletion is only for a case that blatantly abuses a policy.  When I went to this guy's talk page to complain, I notice he has polite complaints
from a litany of other writers questioning similar, direct deletion of their articles.  In short, this guy is habitually abusing his power as an administrator.  The significance of my article is not the issue I wish to raise, but I think it will survive a notability challengeit was about a small multi-grade Christian school that educates high school grades.  From everything I've learned, a high school is notable.  Period.  Much more important, I wish to raise this administrator's Abuse of Power.  We need to rid WP of administrators who unilaterally think their opinion is so important that they can simple delete knowledge from the database without anybody else getting to discuss it.  Other editors might roll over, they might not know how out of line this is.  I'm not going to tolerate this because we have to protect WP and its valuable information from people like this.  How do we go about getting this guy out of the elite administrators pool?

Secondly, since you are deep on the inside, maybe you can address this.  WP procedures are just too oblique for the common user to understand.  This stuff is designed for geeks.  It is difficult to find, difficult to understand and is thusly self limiting to the deep insiders who those who spend the time to figure this crap out.  I wish to encourage you to think about simplification, from the procedures, to the search to find the procedures to the explanation of those procedures.  If you note the vote for Global Sysops.

This article focuses on the military campaign, while the American Revolution covers the origins of the war, as well as other social and political issues.

Please try to keep this article at a reasonable length. The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the general reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of war strategies, battle casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions.

Instead of adding additional detail to this lengthy article, consider adding your information to an article on a specific battle, or to one of these campaign articles currently in development. Additionally, one campaign, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga (box at right), does not yet have an article specifically about those operations. Perhaps you will start it Miguel!

Reading this article it looks like the US won the war solo, with some assistance (which was mostly inept) from some other countries, one of which happened to be France.  This is evident in the introduction and throughout the article.  The introduction is particularly blatant, mentioning non-American intervention only as an after thought.  Should the WWI and WWII articles mention American intervention as an afterthought too? Am I the only one to think this is a problem?   

I have edited the intro so that it is less laughable.

As for the even younger authors, Yisroel Nekrasov is widely published in literary periodicals in Israel, USA and Russia and his first book collection is scheduled to appear within next few weeks in Moscow (selections of his original poetry can be read in the online magazine """"Der Bavebter Yid"""" and on . Boris Kotlerman's original prose was published in two major Yiddish literary periodicals in Israel (at least twice in each one of them). Haike Beruriah Wiegand's poetry appeared in """"Bavebter Yid"""" and soon in """"Yerusholaimer Almanakh"""" in Jerusalem (see a small selection of her highly sophisticated verse at ). Perhaps a special case could be made for retaining their names in this entry for it is not all that easy for a contemporary Yiddish author to publish her or his work in a separate book no matter how well known and well received that work might be among contemporary Yiddish readers. A case in point is Alexander Belousov whose work was extremely well known and widely acclaimed, but whose first and so far the only collection of works appeared posthumously in 2006. 

Finally, and for the record, there are also two Yiddish poets (and Yiddish scholars), Gilles Rosier in Paris and Thomas Soxberger in Vienna who are also accomplished and well published novelistsin in French and German respectively.

Furthermore, the Conservatives have made their exact reservations about loss of sovereignty quite clear. Don't use phrasing that implies the contrary.

Hi, Fred. I saw your note on Sammy's page and wanted to reply. (If you recall, I was the one who got the photo from you a few months back.) First of all, I'm very sorry to hear about Sammy's second stroke - I live in Los Angeles now so I'm often out of touch with what's happening in the Hudson Valley. Please pass along my best wishes.

Anyway, it seems the problems you pointed out in the article are errors of omission, rather than factual errors, so I just want to clarify them with you. 

First, you want the article to mention that your brother found him and brought him to you to bring to Imus, correct? 

Second, the discography section is completely empty, so please don't take it personally that your albums aren't there. It did not exist at all when I first wrote the article, and someone recently created the section but didn't put anything in it.

Am I understanding you correctly on both points? Assuming I can find reliable sources for this info, I will do my best to update it by the weekend. By the way, every page has a talk page (if you look at the top, it's under the tab marked """"discussion""""). The best way to communicate is to use talk pages, rather than editing the article itself. This is your personal discussion page, so you can reply to me here if you want to talk.

I'll concede the """"shoutaboutastic"""" (though only because the English Wikipedia is read by many for whom English is not a first language) but if you pay closer attention to the half a dozen or so examples of true """"myths"""" I have provided above, you'll see that they are indeed factually correct - that is, that what is alleged to be a myth is in fact a fact. Now, we could waste time discussing whether the word """"myth"""" always implies falsehood but let's not bother. Let's take the """"myth"""" in """"Euromyth"""" to mean exactly what the coiners of """"Euromyth"""" intended it to mean: a falsehood about the European Union. It would also save a lot of time if you and other Wikipedians just accepted that there are dozens of other examples of non-mythical Euromyths out there. Is that acceptance likely? No. The Commission has spent billions on propaganda in the last two decades. (Will I keep chipping away at the Commission's outrageous Euromythmyths? Not while sober, no. Who would?)

 The poison 

When the japanese diplomat replaced huo's tea with the poisoned one, did Anno Tanaka realise at the end of the movie? To me, it is strongly implied as a yes.

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

"Interesting study on false convictions and rape 

Rapes of white women by black men account for well under 10 percent

This stark disparity suggests that prosecutions of interracial rapes
with black defendants are particularly error prone, perhaps because—as
many psychological studies show—white Americans are much more likely to
mistake one African-American stranger for another than to do so with

The Fourth Amendment, which states:  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. The Tenth Amendment, which states: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The legal encyclopedia American Jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and the name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed ... An unconstitutional law is void. (16 Am. Jur. 2d, Sec. 178)

These are fine legal arguments and I personally agree with them. But they clearly represent a personal judgement (correct as it it may be) on a controversial political topic. But that is not what Wikipedia is about. WP:NPOV implies that statements of opinion, such as The REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States Constitution, are not appropriate in a WP article. It would be perfectly OK to say, however, something like Critics charge that the REAL ID Act violates the following articles and amendments of the United States and then provide a reference to some reliable source
where such criticism is raised. As your edit reads now, not only does it represent a statement of opinion, but the way in which this opinion is justified also, in my view, violates WP:NOR. Instead of citing some sources where consititutionality of the Real ID Act is questioned in the way you describe, you list some general legal sources that in your view (and in mine)justify your opinion. This is a clear instance of original research that WP:NOR prohibits.

There are plenty of newsarticles and other reliable sources that criticize the Real ID Act and I think you will not have much trouble finding a few of them that raise the same points as your edit does. So if you want to make a constructive input, please find such sources and add them to the article. Regards,   """,0

The patriotic instincts of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, rather than a desire to assert Hong Kong's separate identity, have been the main motivating factor in introduction of the bill. Tung himself owes a personal debt to the PRC government: his family's shipping conglomerate Orient Overseas was bailed out for the sum of $US120 million by Chinese government-owned companies in the 1980s.

A source that is not listed as an inline citation in an article is not a reference, it does not point to any specific text in the article. It is """"further reading"""" material unless it can be used to verify text. 

Notes and References

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is """"References""""; other articles use """"Notes"""", """"Footnotes"""", or """"Works cited"""" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title """"References"""" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

 About Operating Mode? 

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am so sorry to bother you, but I've seen your post on Processor Register, the original text is copied to bellow

| IA32e || 8 || 8 || Early concept of EM64T, coded name """"Yamhill"""". the register were extending from 32 bit to 64 bit. unlike x86-64 this design do not come with additional general purpose register(r8 ~ r15)and lack of 64 bit MMU and address mode. support 32 bit address mode with PAE for maximum compatibility with legacy application. early Prescott, Tejas and Timna were the only implement of this ISA and later is replaced by EM64T.

That is so interesting and amazing. Besides, I wonder the information on Operating Mode. Is the original IA32e mode a sub-Mode of protected mode or a new mode like it in AMD64? Does the original 32-bit protected OS need to be changed from the scratch or just provides extension support for those new introduced 64-bit instructions? That is most amazing thing for me.

 Perspective? 
""""In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

Most of your edits are fine. Thank you for restoring previous edits in a non-POV way which I think is acceptable. Most of the article is fine. I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?

Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, """"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).""""""",0

Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """,0
"Ah Yahel very honest of you to remove my comments without specifying who you are, what exact objection you have, and what authority you have to remove my comments as a personal attack, I am reverting and will only remove these comments mself if you AND another editor can give a reason why my comments are more ofeensive than defensive of user: Bless Sins, and how your comments have not been any more offensive on this page than mine.86.150.147.133   user: R.G.P.A I am replacing my comments below:

Whether you think islam is false or not is irrelevant, as a christian I might be nclined to think that Judaism and Islam are 'false', you say that we 'have' to believe islam is false because I am a Christian, no this is not the case, depending on what you mean by 'false'. Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias. Dont pretend you are some omniscient perfect observer, becase as your edits show that would be a clear and arrogant lie to yourself, and my only advice to you is to refrain from being hypocritical.86.150.147.133  User: R.G.P.A

"Deletion of The Sunday Times Travel Magazine 

Hi Pam
Thanks for your New User guidelines. Much appreciated. I tried to make it clear that I was a staffer on the magazine, but will do the extra bits you've suggested. HOWEVER, I can't do that until it is reinstated. I tried to write the page as independently as possible, with no fluff or marketing speak, but it was still deleted by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Randykitty, despite the fact that ALL of our competitor titles have pages.

Do you know how I can get it reinstated? Then I can make the changes you've suggested. Otherwise, do you know if Wikipedia / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Randykitty will be removing all competitor pages, too? 

Any advice gratefully received.

Cheers

 Military history WikiProject Newsletter, Issue I 

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson.

So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

""":Ali, as I've wrote, none of those authors are aware of many important details, such as Kurekchay Treaty - an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of Karabakh into Russian empire. At the same time, the khan of Sheki too signed a similar treaty, for example. I know Michael Croissant, and his book is full of mistakes and errors, his book doesn't mean much in this regard. His mistakes are too gross  the Russo-Iran war started in 1806, whilst Karabakh became part of Russia in 1805 before such a war. Meanwhile, Tim Potier is a good legal expert, and it is surprizing to see him write that. But everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources - he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of Karabakh in 19th century was not his objective  the 20th century was. Anyways, I do not know the khans of Iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with British. If they did it in the Zand period, they probably had full legal right at the time, since Iran was more of a geographic entity, than political. Same with Azerbaijan (North) - it was geographic too. Whilst I do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time, the later Russian and British documents clearly identified Azerbaijanis of the North as """"aderbeijani tatars"""" - I have evidence of that as far back as 1880 in British census estimates and in the 1897 official Russian Imperial Census. Same word is used by Russian ethnographer Velichko in his 1903 book. Azerbaijani author, Firudin bey Kocharly wrote a book in 1908 """"Literature of Azerbaijani Turks"""". 

Anyways, Azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both Iran and Russia at the time, and some sided with either one side or another. Unfortunately, you won't find much on that in libraries - but just one such translated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions. What is more important however, is that Karabakh khan (khan being a Turkic term derived from kagan), was that it concluded its own treaty, that it minted its own money (one of the typical examples of independence), and fought several wars with Iran, some handily winning, others, like 1797, ambgiously  but still Shah Muhammed Qajar gets killed. And I don't know who told you about Vagif and Ibrahim  by the later you probably mean Ibrahim khan, right? Well, Vagif, the poet and vizier, was executed in 1797, AFTER shah's death, and was executed by the temporary ruler, Mamed bey Jevanshir, who was nephew of Ibrahim khan. While details are murky and contradictory, the Qajars didn't have the primary rolse in this  indeed, once shah was killed, Iranian troops withdrew, it screwed up all the plans to re-conquering other parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Meanwhile, Ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error - or so it is explained  in 1806. But anyway, the Kurekchay Treaty was signed by him. Thus, once more, Karabakh khanate, for one, was totally independent, and Iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it. Meanwhile, few other khanates were nominally dependent - like Poland was to USSR, or Armenia to Russia (Russian speaker of Parliament, #3 person in the country, openly called it """"forepost of Russia"""" whilst in Armenia).

"""
I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The """"modern system"""" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and """"modal"""" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate """"modal flavor"""" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other. I shall see what I can do to clear this up (using reliable sources, of course).—  """,0

He first started his career on Millside hospital radio as a member of the 'Jan and Jules' show team and broadcasted every thursday night from 6pm-9pm.  He then struck out a solo career and moved to ashfield community radio where he had three different shows over 2 years.  These were 'Saturday sport' which broadcast saturdays 5pm-7pm, 'LIVE MID MORNING SATURDAY/SUNHDAY' (depened which day it was) between 9am and 12 midday.  Finaly he teamed up with nina squires to do the 'Super Sports Saturday Show' between 2pm and 6pm.  He then left ashfield comunity radio in late 2005 to move to 'Regency FM' which broadcast on the internet.  There he ran a show on saturday mornings 10am-1pm 'The Saturday Revolution Show',  Which grew a cult following across north east derbyshire and bangor in Wales.  Then sadly Regency Radio closed down due to lack of funds.

"""::::::: Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
 I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid?Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. 
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.
God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

 Defacing compliant sigs 

This edit has been partially reverted as it changed two users' compliant signatures on a project page without prior discussion with the users.

Well, """"Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to reduce the quality of the encyclopedia."""" I don't see Tony's edits as vandalism (even in an extended sense), though the last few seemed to have a bit of spite and muse to them, which I don't like. 

 If any of my edits have given the impression of spite that was an error. I am aware of no spite.  I only seek to improve the encyclopedia. 

 I don't think you quite understand.   Any discussion can be improved by refactoring.  This will inevitably involve, as a desired end product, reduction of noise, the most obvious of which is unnecessary content in signatures, """"compliant"""" (whatever that might mean) or not.  Discussions are about, believe it or not, the exchange of information, not the repeated depositing of random graffiti on pages devoted to discussion of a subject not related to that graffiti.

 I'm running out of polite ways to say """"you are behaving  in an incredibly stupid manner; please reconsider your approach to Wikipedia.""""  -Tony Sidaway 

Hey, Tony, per our Wikien-L discussion... if you're pissing people off seriously when you do it, knock off doing it.  The cure is worse than the illness, when you piss them off.   

Tony has more guts than I do...I am constantly tempted to help save server lag by """"fixing"""" signatures. 

I'm not saying they're not annoying.  But I am saying, and have said (with a chorus of agreements, but not unanimity) on Wikien-L that the consequences of getting people angry by refactoring sigs in a manner they believe is abusive is worse than the consequences of leaving the sigs as is.  There's been discussion about a signature size limit, which I support, in some form or another.  But the side effects of refactoring a bunch of random people's sigs are that they're percieving it as abuse by Tony, not as a cleanup effort, and reasonable people should always think twice if people complain that they're being abusive.
The proper solution to this has to either be Tony being a lot more polite about the refactoring (for example, telling people on their talk pages, nicely asking them to change, ec), or for there to be a policy change that limits sig size so there's no question as to whether the refactor is """"ok"""" or not.  Tony irritating people when he's acting fully in compliance with policy is acceptable to me.  Tony irritating or abusing people when policy has gotten vague on a point, is not.   

Please stop defacing users' signatures when they are clearly in compliance with WP:SIG. Willful and intentional violation of WP:POINT is''' vandalism and may result in a block from editing Wikipedia. Kirk talk to me """,0

Almost all his edits(which have been consistently poised against the Tamil people in general need to be reviewed, and he needs to explain on what overall value he has added to wikipedia in his edits, except for adding/removing sensitive information that fulfills his whims) So perhaps, involvement of more editors to the issue will see through his low-down motives with which he edits, and the barbaric means he resorts to when he gets desperate.

 How to insert new data into a sortable table 

Sorting makes the lists more useful, but more marginally more difficult to add new data.  It's not difficult once you understand that sorting numerically isn't possible because of BC in some of the years and commas in the casualty figures.  All we are doing here is converting those numbers into an alphabetic format that the table can sort.

Sorting for casualties, zero padding is necessary if we are going to use comma separators
CCCC represents the casualty number
Use:{{formatnum:{{padleft:CCCC|7|0}}}} 
Example: {{formatnum:{{padleft:300000|7|0}}}} produces 0,300,000
In case of a range, like (5,000-10,000), only the first number needs to use the formatnum template to make it sortable.
The use of the tilde '~' destroys the sort order.  I don't think it's really necessary since almost all of these numbers are approximate anyway.

To make years sortable we have to insert invisible characters before the actual values.
To do this, we use  anything here is invisible
 YYYY represents the year
For years BC:
Use: !{{#expr: 9999 - YYYY}} YYYY BC
Example: 846 BC becomes !{{#expr: 9999 - 846}} 846 BC
Note the space just before the . It is necessary!
For years AD:
We pad left N number of zeros to make the year 4 digits
Use: #NYYYY
Example: 3 becomes #0003
Example: 34 becomes #0034
Example: 345 becomes #0345
Example: 1456 becomes #1456
Note there is no space before and after the . Also necessary!

Why was the below article redirected to ET? I thought it was setup for a vote and nothing was finalised?

Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity

EBE is an abbreviation for the term Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity.

In the 1940's several alien spacecraft were allegedly recovered by the U.S. and other countries, along with a few dead aliens and one live one. These beings were referred to as EBEs (a name suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush).

The term was first made reference to in 1986 when Jenny Randles interviewed a military soldier named """"Robert"""" about some stolen Top Secret US Military papers. The term was first made public in 1987 with the release of the Majestic 12 documents by Timothy Good (a)(b):

""""Dr. Detlev Wulf Bronk's team has suggested the term """"Extra Terrestrial Biological Entities"""" (EBEs), be adopted as the standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as a more definitive designation can be agreed upon.""""  (b)

In a letter to researcher William Steinman, Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher who was with the Washington Institute of Technology, confirms that some of the scientists involved in the study of recovered flying discs from Roswell were Dr. Vannever Bush, John von Neumann, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. (c) Steinman also discovered that one of the scientists working on saucer technology from the early days was Dr. Eric Henry Wang who became Director of the Department of Special Studies, within the Structures Division, of the old Wright Air Development Center, near Dayton, Ohio. 

This term has been often used in the TV series X-files.

 Further response.... 

Mr. Galal, you seem, perhaps, frustrated. This is understandable, since you work for Medcan and you surely want the Wikipedia article to include only promotional information. However, Wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth. 
- If wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth, then you should say that even though the Danish Meta Study brings up valid arguments regarding physical examinations and their impact on health outcomes, generally speaking physical examinations are widely accepted and useful healthcare screening tools. I suspect every first world country recommends medicals with a General Practitioner - your comment is stating that these countries health organizations and policy makers are incorrect. And that medicals schools are also incorrect in their lessons.  And we may as well change how medicine is practiced and treat people when they get sick, not try to catch disease early.

The meta-study itself is fairly recent (just two years old). It was brought to us thanks to the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration. I see no reason why a Danish meta-study would be inapplicable to Canada, though you are welcome to try to convince me otherwise.

I won't dispute your point that most people in First World countries undergo routine physical examinations. And I won't dispute that they are customary. But have they been proven to be useful? Not to my knowledge.
- This is an astonishingly closed minded comment.  Medcan alone has hundreds of cases where we've saved peoples lives, improved there lives, provided them insight for future care, etc.  The word """"useful"""" is vague - useful as in leading a healthier life?  Absolutely.  Useful as in keeping someone alive who has a terminal illness - probably not.

I think there is more than enough here for you to understand why we have such an issue with this comment on the Medcan wikipedia page.  If this was an Encyclopedia - there is not a chance it would be posted.  There is no facts or evidence that the Danish study is 100% true - and Medcan's model of care is not just to diagnose, but to also help people through lifestyle modifcation and coaching.""",0

Thanks?=
I am an African American currently residing outside of the States.  I just wanted to write and say """"Thanks DeeCee"""", for your work over at the Black Supremacist page.  I surfed there by accident.  I was shocked to find that Wikipedia has even chosen to include this article.  It is far too long in view of the insignificance of so-called """"Black Supremacy"""" when compared to the massive White Supremacist Movement which is once again taking the entire White World by storm.  (Are you a Black Supremacist, if you are only trying to survive in a nation that overtly practices and tolerates Racist practices such a lynching or segregation?)  Until I read our courageous comments, I was truly daunted by the sheer malevolence that appears to be at work in that article, especially the insidious denigrations of Marcus Garvey.  So many considered him to be a hero for addressing Black suffering in the Post Slavery Occident.  Yet, that article slanders him viciously, referring to him as an errand boy of the Klu Klux Klan and a friend of White Supremacists.  I have not been able to find any truth in any of these statements, so I deleted them.  So much of the material there appears to be merely conjectured or anecdotal designed to tell ugly tales about African people in general rather than focus on the purported subject at hand.  Yet, on the White Supremacist page, there are no such juicy tidbits to further incite anger and outrage.  There are no tales told period, just the bare bones concerning this virulent hate-inspired movement.  In fact, much has been left out.  The White Supremacist article could have included a number of recent and not so reccent events that would have turned any reader's stomach but the writer keeps it very cut and dry.  Not so on the Black Supremaciy page where, the author goes out of his way to assasinate the character of any Black person who remotely expresses any racial pride or hope for his people.  I guess, he is just two fingers from calling Martin Luther King a Black Supremacist, since he incited Black people to protest white brutality and segregation.

I want to complain to Wikipedia about the unhealthy tone in which the Black Supremacist page has been written.  The assaults on Rappers and other musicians such as Lauren Hill is shocking.  I have no doubt that the article is motived by racial hate.  It is so apt that you have identified the problems as systemic.  Wikipedia is a true menace in the sense that people of African descent are often assaulted but may lack the resources, time or orientations necessary to defend themselves against those who use Wikipedia to commit what amounts to racial assault.  Refutations are highly resented and a general ambiance of White supremacist aggression reigns on many pages.  I haven't read all that you've written, I imagine that you spend a lot of time, fighting the good fight.  Again thanks.  I hope you get this message.Sincerely

 Ceiling fan article edit 

Thanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions.

I admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates.

Howeverand I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards.

This is how the statement read before you edited it:

""""Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.""""

You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads:

""""The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.""""""""

...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful.

I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say """"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!"""". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the """"bone-chilling"""" factor into the mix.

Anyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article. But thanks for reading it and contributing! In the future, before making edits to statements of fact in an already-established article, please get a consensus on the article's talk page.

Thanks!  """,0

As far as I know, it is your interest in pursuing this I am accommodating and the characterization of a """"song and dance"""" is not one I feel is appropriate to describe my total ambivalence to your inquiry (please understand - the preceding is not intended to be trite, I simply want to unambiguously communicate that the entire matter is one of no interest to me, so as to assuage any concerns of a """"song and dance""""). 
 I would like to personally apologize to you for not responding to your interrogatories """"forthwith."""" I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation. I know you've said you're incredulous to that notion, but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway. 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended - as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing - and not as a slight in any way. If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse, understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue, and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you. 
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know, however, in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner, I would like to suggest we terminate this back-and-forth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be. Best -

Agree. Of course it isn't real. But what really provided the sour taste was the trailer for Season One. An off-camera voice (presumably Esther) proclaims there really *is* an Amish Mafia. Amazing how that matches the series title perfectly! This is what I would expect from a seventh grader with a 'D' average struggling with an English essay or composition, not a truly authentic and spontaneous documentary. The executive producer of the show and the owner of Hot Snakes Media, Eric Evangelista on his LinkedIn page has for his goal as revolutionizing the way unscripted television is produced. Well one way you can to that is to just make it scripted which is what this garbage is. I am surprised Discovery purchased this series for a second season. Apparently their lineup is a little thin.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0

 Editorial issues 

There are points where Highsmith betrays her lack of familiarity with 1980s New York City. I'd like to find a source that comments on this. I find it distracting and careless, and I wonder why her publisher, UK or US, didn't think these things worth fixing. No New Yorker has ever ordered a """"white coffee"""" or handed someone a """"fiver"""" or written """"The Bronx"""" with a capital T. By the 1980s the police were not """"the fuzz"""", even ironically, and Chelsea is Chelsea or perhaps the Chelsea neighborhood, never """"the Chelsea district"""". The video arcade where Ralph works is on Eighth Avenue in the 80s, which doesn't exist, since that's Central Park West. Then, without explanation, it's on Broadway in the 80s. And nowhere in the West 80s would one have found anything like the arcade as described, not even in the 80s when NYC was going through a very rough period.   """,0

Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections.

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

Biased section on Turkey

""""Turkey On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none. 

And there is such a biased section on Turkey. the editor andranik, an armenian by origin, who carries the name of the armenian terrorist and nationlist milita head accuses",0

Republics
Need your help and/or advice.  The British Wikipedian Republican Party sought fit to delete Wikinfo:Classical definition of republic from Wikipedia.  There is a terrible brouhaha at Talk:Republic. They won't even allow an external link! SimonP really doesn't know what he is doing.  They deleted the Classical definition of republic and created mixed government and politeia instead.  The official title of mixed government is a Republic and the Romans translated """"politiea"""" as Republic.

How can that be when Venice in the 13th century instituted a mixed government and called herself a """"Republic"""".

The infamous block

Veritas: do not get Wikinoid yet. The policy is on my side: it was a totally unjust block and I am appealing. I still trust Wikipedia.

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield... (oops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties.

 Request for deletion reconsideration 

I would like to ask to have the deletion of the page ANA SANTIAGO be reconsidered on the following grounds:

A. This person has founded and heads the only Impact Evaluation Network in Latin America and the Caribbean. This network is part of LACEA (http://www.lacea.org/portal/index.php), the most important international association of economists interested in doing research in the region. She is a permanent Honorary Member of LACEA, award given by her contribution to impact evlauation reserach and policy relevance for the region ( http://www.lacea.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=24&phpMyAdmin;=b883a10db6c19d415348047740f5c4b0&phpMyAdmin;=f18f79e76e8f09c4b5c658d1db20ad3f).The contribution of founding the network is is widely referred to and attended by policymakers, governments, NGOs, and academics in the field. This contribution falls into the category """"creative professionals"""" of the notability criteria, mostly 2 and 3 with c) of number 4:

""""Creative professionals
Scientists, academics, economists, professors, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals:
1.The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by peers or successors.
2.The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique.
3. The person has created, or played a major role in co-creating, a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, that has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.
4. The person's work either (a) has become a significant monument, (b) has been a substantial part of a significant exhibition, (c) has won significant critical attention, or (d) is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums.""""

B. Further, this person is part of the very small team of persons that have been given the mandate from the Haitian government to redesign a major reform and reconstruction of Haiti's education system following the 2010 earthquake. This has been cited in other pages such as MARCELO CABROL

""""Reconstructing Haiti's Education system after the 2010 earthquake: President Preval gave the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB the mandate to work with the Education Ministry and the National Commission preparing a major reform of the Education System in a 5 year plan.

C. Finally, she leads the all the research and evaluation of one of the main Multilaterals (IDB) on Education topics, directly responsible for ongoing pilots and evaluations for over 200 million dollars. Part of this work has been taking the implementation and designing the impact evaluation of the Teach for America (national teaching corps) model to the region currently in place in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. The evaluation design improves on the US evaluations so far, fac that has been recognized and cited in the region and outside (including the US and Europe) by Wendy Kopp, founder of TFA.

Hey Nikkimaria.  I may have let Prof Newbold's students get into a bit of a quandary.  They've begun to draft a new article on The Dark Side of Chocolate (not theirs), a doc about choc.  Here's their draft page:  (Talk) """,0
"Yes there may well be a small number of law firm articles which do not have a complete list of offices, but the overwhelming majority do, as you will have no doubt have discovered yourself in your search. I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.

 My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. 

 The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.

 Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.

 Please consider that you are seeking to reduce the sum total of information available to Wikipedia readers. How do readers benefit from the deletion of this information? I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.

 I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles. I have no particular problem with this, but wonder why law firms in general, and this law firm in particular, are being singled out for so much harsher treatment here.",0

 Eco-terrorism article 

I have recently cast my eye over the eco-terrorism article. This article is factually deficient and is definitely not NPOV. The article on terrorism is, on its face, very good and I am asking that editors of this article to please turn their attention to the eco-terrorism article and add material that can add to, and enhance, this article as well as to remove POV bias and correct the factual errors and omissions. Thanks, TranquillityBase Message """,0
"What is also interesting is the supposed access to Top Secret info.  The vetting process for that sort of clearance is extensive.  With Manning's unsettled childhood and discipline problems earlier in his enlistment, a TS clearance would have been problematic and/or pulled.  More likely he did not have TS clearance and the info saying he did is incorrect.  But Wikipedia is not about truth, so no problem if this very small bit of information persists.",0
"""The Bulgarians were never tengriists, neither we worshipped Tengri, tengriism is a primitive shamanism and has absolutely nothing in common with our pagan pre-christian beliefs. The Bulgarians were early Zoroastrians - the cult to the Sun and the Fire, we were building fire temples like the Persian ones. There is not even one evidence to support the thesis that we were tengriists or that we called the god with the name Tangra/Tengri. In fact there is this evidence by the Persian scholar Al-Balkhi that says: """"I heard the Bulgarians call the Creator with the name Edfu and when I asked them how they﻿ call their idol, they answered Fa."""" - Al-Balkhi, a persian scholar lived in the 9th century. (M. Tahir, Le livre de la creation de el-Balhi. Paris, 1899, v. IV, p. 56).
Articles like this one filled with turkish crap and administrated by primitive psycho-sick people like this jingby makes wikipedia look highly unreliable, now I understand why it is forbidden to be cited in scientific and academical studies and universities.

"Mysideae asked me to comment here in my volunteer capacity. I do not know anything about this topic, but looking at the Criticism section of the current article, it appears to all be reflective of specific time-periods and therefore belongs in the History section. A dedicated Criticism section is not a neutral title and draws undue attention to the criticisms. Though you could also look at it the other way, that they are buried at the bottom and belong near the top.

As for the draft, I see there are some nice plugs for Moodys, that are especially heavily cited and have substantial weight. Well... I wrote the article on History of public relations and it mentions some PR agencies that played a role in its history, so this is not unprecedented. However, I am concerned about the weight of this material and whether it is fair to other agencies. 

I think the draft is valuable enough as a starting point for it to be worth our attention, but I would suggest an editor do some light research independently, trim, copyedit and re-write it and mix it with the current Criticisms section into a more balanced History.  (Talk)",0

This is an article about the Xbox 360 technical problems and the Towel trick while being a stupid thing to do is a legitimate topic on that subject.

"Since my block 6 days ago, Iss246 (and his close friend, outside of Wikipedia, psyc12) immediately, frantically and systematically reverted 'masses' of established, reliably sourced edits, only hours after I was blocked. In fact, every single edit that I, through consensus, had ever established and stayed in place. These were very well sourced, solid edits. Many of these edits in numerous articles had been established and remained unchanged for over 3, even 6 months, depending on the article page. Many of these reverts during the last week, also undid the work of other editors involved in developing the 'consensus' that then stayed in place. 

The only editor, truly independent on these articles recently, was an editor Mark viking. He made this valid comment on the Talk:Health psychology page. He seems quite genuine, but then his comments were actually 'deleted' entirely from the public talk page? He was the only editor who commented on the rapid, systematic 'demolition job' and complete 'censorship' of my edits to these article pages containing months old, established edits, with multiple, reliable sources attached to them. Mark viking said this to psyc12 . 

 Thanks for expanding that section, but it seems you removed a sourced assertion on the origin of OHP. Do you dispute that source, or have a source asserting that OHP and I/O psychology are totally separate? I ask this because the relation of these fields seems to be an area of contention at WP, and removal of sources isn't going to help.     

I invite anyone to look at the combined edit history of iss246 (and his close friend/colleague outside of wikipedia), psyc12 since the 16th of January until today in 'numerous articles.' These 'Wikipedia owned' articles are again now, grossly biased and distorted.",0

I understand you, but you also should understand me. You shouldn't revert my work. As you can see, I don't disrupt your edits at articles Draza Mihailovic, Josip Broz Tito, or at Template:Yugoslav Axis collaborationism. I realy respect your effort and work there, and I don't revert it. I have no desire to get blocked, or to drag you into another blockade. I want to resolve all this disputes with you. As you can see I already changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. These are my proposals to you:

1) If we put in place your version of the list of Yugoslav Prime Ministers, it will remove Drago Marusic as Prime Minister in 1945, between Ivan Subasic and Tito. If you agree to left him on the list, this dispute is over. If we agree about Marusic, we can also agree about the issue """"Kingdom or DF Yugoslavia"""".

2) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a complete different state than Serbia and Montenegro. It wasn't like Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, or Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, after the adoption of the Constitutional Charter, whole system of government was changed. Even the position of the Prime Minister was abolished, and merged with the position of the President. Those two countries realy need a separate articles. Also, their armies need a separate articles.

3) Articles President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President of Serbia and Montenegro should remain separate. The last President of FRY was Vojislav Kostunica, from 2000 until 2003 when he was replaced by Svetozar Marovic of SCG (2003-2006). Those two offices was very different (President of FRY wasn't both head of state and head of government, like President of SCG). 

4) Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wasn't """"Prime Minister of Serbia and Montenegro"""", but of FRY. That article should retain its current name.

5) As you can see, yesterday I changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. I hope that you agree with this version.

P.S. 

I'm sorry if you think that people from the Balkans are uncivilized. It's not true, believe me. We aren't better or worse than other peoples.   """,0

"Undent.  That's actually quite helpful, thanks.  The indef block was premature (not unwarranted in my highly biased opinion) as all the evidence uninvolved editors were presented with was a vast, ugly sprawling page of crap that would be extremely difficult to tease out.  Any editor who didn't have involvement with him would be hard-pressed to come to any conclusion based on it.  The whole reason I delayed starting an AN or ANI thread was so I could thoroughly review his contribs and create a solid final version that would hopefully be more convincing than what I have now.  I'm in process for that, and this will be useful; also helpful for the arb case that will almost certainly land in my lap.  Content disputes are very difficult to sort out, and in my experience undue weight is probably the hardest thing to demonstrate to someone who is not already an informed participant in the debate.  This looks like the pure wikipedia-process equivalent, but your summary will make it easier for me to grasp.  I'm also comforted that yet another editor has reached an opinion I feel has some truth to it - Guido's contributions are based on his own opinion and will not shift no matter the evidence.

"""

(It took me some time to write this as you may have already added stuff, or there could be stuff already there I missed in the first place)

May I.....  Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) 

You have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced """"welder"""", save for I'm sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven't been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  

HOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I've read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can't stand things which don't come up in google counts.

The list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of """"authoritative"""" sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a """"school of thought"""" on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything """"so they say"""".  

X-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.

A highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.

This largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki's undoing.   

From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating """"duty-cycle"""") to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a 'shortness' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to """"wick"""" (conduct) heat away from the p",0

 imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a """"see also"""" pointing to the other page.

In response to Bduke's question 2 above, I think that it has become very difficult on wikipedia to say anything general about Guiding and Girl Scouting because someone will always point out that some Guides are boys.

 Menobot problem??

Although the focus of that article is on the various explanations that have been proposed for this IQ difference, the IQ difference itself is considered central enough to the article that it’s represented visually in this chart.  This image used to be part of the article also—it was eventually removed because editors decided that it was original research, but nobody there had a problem with the idea of this data being depicted with an image.

The original research claim obviously doesn’t apply to an image from the DOJ website, and I think all of the same principles that apply to race and intelligence apply here also.

Um well, absence of research isn't research evidence of absence. There's no severely affected patients in that lot and they were only exercised modestly with regard to their illness status; the more sufferers push themselves the more aggravated symptoms and weakness should be. The sort of people who apply for exercise testing are not likely to be already on the verge of a relapse or struggling to cope at work (or even at home). If some of them have practical help or accomodating family they would do worse in the same tests without it. Gosh, no mention of exertional insomnia even.

Most of these studies aren't looking into a variety of somatic symptoms or even pain, only fatigue and functional strength (though the latter's good enough a demonstration of worsening after exercise for me. At the end of the day it's objective measures are most helpful).  If good evidence is totally lacking you have to use next best evidence, with caveats. 

You miss out a major notable source of good evidence in all the ME studies (and synonymous diagnoses) before c. 1988 or the 80's, for instance papers by Acheson, Gilliam, Galpine, Innes, Compston, Wallis et al.  This is after all, where exercise intolerance and severe multi-system symptoms were first described and recognised as a cardinal feature in non-remitting cases.  

There should also be some orthostasis studies. There's also Peckerman's heart studies, Les Simpson's trigger finger study, the Da Costa study, and so on. Though they might not be focussing on symptoms the sort and extent of findings likely gives indirect suppport to the extend and breadth of symptoms.

 regarding International humanitarian law 

The protection of hospitals is according to the Geneva convention. The agreement from 1949 was also signed and ratified by the USA.
According to that agreement hospitals are protected.
The exception is: unless the facilities """"are being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy"""" as rightly commented in the article. But: Even if enemy combatants are inappropriately using the facility for shelter, the """"rule of proportionality"""" usually forbids such attacks because of the high potential for civilian casualties.

And it is not the: Human rights organization Human Rights Watch stated that the laws of war require the attacking force to issue a warning, and wait a reasonable time for a response, before attacking a medical unit being misused by combatants.
but the Geneva convention itself that requires a warning by the attacking force. And that is not a choice.
Why having qualifiers, as if the Geneva convention is not clear on the point of the protection of a hospital. And this scenario, an unannounced air strike by an AC-130 definitely falls outside a hypothetical proportional attack.

 How about...( Warning: I'm Irish)

I'm quite tired of British nationalists trying to legislate for the Irish when they know full well we are superstitious popish natives/ taigs/ fenians for whom rationality is an alien concept. This, of course, contrasts us with the rational superior master race English (or is it British?) who have civilised the rest of us barbarians (how convenient for the British!).
How about this irrational idea from a fully fledged member of the Irish papistry whose family have been killed fighting for Irish freedom against the English/British since as long as family and local folklore allows, and for much, much longer according to the written English (that should comfort you people) historical record. How about you people desist from telling us, the Irish people, that we are mere Brits who haven't discovered this yet ( as so many of you have already argued here). Perhaps we are simply just accepting that the overwhelming majority of Irish people who come near this board dismiss your little pipe-dream notion that is the """"British Isles"""" for being the British colonial project that it is? Shoving your modern concept of Britishness upon this article and using Greek sources from 2000 years ago to support it is British jingoism at its most extreme, particularly when it asserts that the Irish people against all the evidence are """"British"""". Will any British people here (with the honourable exception of Snowded) have honesty about Irish feelings and Irish history on this issue? Trying to tell us Irish people that we are """"British"""" does indeed make you people fanatics.   """,0

Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts

By repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St. Martin's Press (New York), """"Feeling Your Pain,"""" as a source of chapter-long damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps, LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers.

That St. Martin's Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist.  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.

(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,""""Feeling Your Pain,"""" (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, """"has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission."""")

As is now clear, """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.

So to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his """"editing"""" of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.

When I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin's Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.

Someone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.

That his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.

So I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. """"No information is better than misleading information,"""" as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.

I am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.

I have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)

I don't maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other's work has no place. I have labeled some posts """"suggested edits.""""  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.

But LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  

I left LoverofArt's Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.  That is the mark of responsible editing.

Dbiel, I respect your knowledge of the Wikipedia way of doing",0
"Bairstow's method loses its quadratic rate of convergence when trying to find a quadratic factor of multiplicity greater than one, although there are a couple of modifications to it which fix this.

"Perhaps. AFAIK his resignation is at least as big an event as the Titstare controversy itself, probably bigger. We probably can't or shouldn't create an article about him, or it, for WP:BLP1E reasons. Also, reviewing this, it seems that his Titstare comments were a trigger for his firing but not the real reason or cause, they just set some things in motion that led to people reviewing his Twitter feed. In that sense, I do think it is of due weight with respect to this controversy because it is perhaps part of the aftermath. As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture.

According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA?

I agree with having a predominate 35-45%, if you look at the Aregentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has ameridian ancestory, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white? I am from Jalisco, I would have to say that most people I have seen look more white than Italians or Middle Easterns in the U.S.",0

"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",0

 Lesbian and Dyke (slang) articles  

Hello, Lionhead99. If you have checked the edit history of the Lesbian article before, which I believe that you have, you will see that your edits were reverted twice at that article, once by , with me elaborating on Wikiwind's revert for why your edits were reverted, and now by me. Those edit summaries clearly explain why you were reverted. Waiting a month later to restore most of it does not change the issue with your edit. It's not like most people who were watching an article stop watching it a month later and aren't going to notice what is mostly the same change that they objected to before. 

As I've stated, the lead isn't saying that being lesbian is a choice; it's saying whether or not to identify as lesbian is a choice; sexual identity is not always the same as sexual orientation, which I explained to a different person in September of this year on the Lesbian talk page. Your edits, among other things, removed material that addresses the important ways that the term """"lesbian"""" is used, material that is partly a summary of the Sexuality and lesbian identity section. Per WP:LEAD, the lead is supposed to """"summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies."""" Partially because """"lesbian"""" is often not consistently defined in the same way by women who use the term to describe their sexuality, it often is not consistently defined in the same way by researchers (see page 22). The Lesbian article is a big article; so it, of course, makes sense that its lead is four paragraphs, which is the advised limit for the lead. Leads may or may not include sources, as what is in the lead should be sourced in the lower body of the article and since sourcing the lead is a case-by-case matter. See Wikipedia:Lead#Citations. And WP:OVERLINKING is not good.

It should also help that  changed the """"About""""/disambiguation tag to identify that this article is not just about sexual orientation: """"This article is about the term Lesbian and female homosexuality. For the sexual orientation in general, see Homosexuality.""""

I also reverted you at the Dyke (slang) article, because, """"The term is not always pejorative anymore, as the lead notes. 'Dyke' is used very often among gay and bisexual-identified women without negative connotation. 'Sissy' or 'faggot' not as much to the same extent by gay men.""""   """,0

Oh I never learnt about her myself. I was given this book as a gift in January and I read about her there. For starters I thought that the information about her was incorrect or a hoax. I could not grasp the notion of an Indian chief being an engineer. So I just used google to gather some information. I saw that she had no article on wikipedia so I just lumped my information in an article and put it up here. 

Also as I said before, there are lots and lots of things which need to be added to this article. If your student is willing to help it will be highly appreciated. For example more citations/sources are needed which can show that she """" was the recipient of the Campfire Girls Certificate of Appreciation of Outstanding Service in 1970"""" and that she """"was awarded the United States Air Force Award of Superior Performance"""". Also there are some other things which kinda irked me. If your student is still editing I'll be happy to post them on his talkpage.

"Revertion of comments about 1985 Wyatt expeditions - dowsing device 

Since one of my friends disappeared in mysterious circumstances, leaving his tent and personal effects behind, from an expedition while investigate a Noah's Ark hoax, I bring a certain need for academic or even journalistic accuracy to the subject.

In particular, I have become aware of evidence about the device used in the 1985 Wyatt survey - and had posted a critical comment - with supporting links to Creation Magazine.

This was reverted without comment - see history.

Since these facts are now widely accessible on the internet how can the redactors of this page justify leaving the article giving half the story of the 1985 Wyatt expedition?

Informers are thus bad people, but usually people who are in some way treasonable.

They may well have been close to the security forces (RIC or army) and helped them but this is what they were brought up to do.

Where is he called a terrorist?  We just closed an WP:RFC with consensus against doing so, so that can pretty much be summarily reverted if it shows up.  There is some thought that his own statements about terrorism may be included with context as appropriate.    
He admited to setting bombs and being a member of a certified terrorist organization. Ayers is a terrorist.   
You certainly have a right to that opinion.  On Wikipedia we have agreed to not call him one.  Incidentaly, the Weathermen is not """"certified"""" as anything, nor does Ayers agree that he is a terrorist.  There is considerable reason why we don't do that here.  But that's moot.  That's gone up and down through all the available dispute resolution channels so for the moment that decision is final.    
You are wrong. I know it is hard to admit when one is wrong, but you should try. The Weatherman were declared a terrorist organization by the FBI - if that isn't a certified then I don't know what is. If someone belongs to a terrorist organization and sets bombs then they are a terrorist. I mean, you might as well argue that Paul McCartney isn't a singer unless he is declared as such.  
 You must have missed the dozens of reliable sources that Noroton posted at the RfC calling Ayers a terrorist.   
And you must have missed the point. According to the legal system, Ayers has never committed a violent act. X 
 Put down the keyboard.... you really need to find something else to do right now.    
Gentlemen, perhaps you can have a debate over whether Ayers is a terrorist or not on some other page - there are a million pages on Wikipedia, three million really, and I don't really feel like hosting a moot debate on the issue.  On Wikipedia we have decided to not apply that label to him.  There are probably a hundred thousand blog pages, message boards, etc., where you can call him a terrorist to your heart's content.    
Wow, you are a flaming liberal, aren't you?  So, let me get this straight...

In your opinion, someone who builds bombs for use against the U.S. Government and civilian buildings is not a terrorist.  Let us all hope you aren't in a position of leadership in real life.  Simply appalling, really. 75.40.204.26  
No! What don't you fucking get? Nobody is saying """"Ayers isn't a terrorist."""" Just that per Wikipedia policies, he should not and cannot be labeled as such in his biography. X 
And the organization, which he helped found, was classified, by the FBI, as a terrorist organization. What more do you want? Shall we repeal the 5th amendment and waterboard, """"I'm a terrorist"""" out of him?  """,0

In reply to  you state in your edit summary for the """"Existence of God"""" article: """"Undid revision 256247715 by 74.4.222.208 (talk) Difference is of opinion is not vandalism. Omega point is fringe."""" That claim doesn't even make coherent sense, besides the fact that you replaced a literate entry with an illiterate edit.

Even if one incorrectly thinks that the Omega Point Theory is """"fringe,"""" that has no logical connection with the edit that Jeffro77 made. Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

It seems from our article that """"official Church publications"""" and critics of the church AGREE that there have been numerous changes to the text of the Book of Mormon.  If so, the numerous changes seem to be a matter of fact, not a matter of controversy.

In this case, could the section be written in a more straightforward way?  In particular, starting the section with the views of two critics of the church seems to me to suggest that it is a matter of controversy.

 A response to """"For the attention of the IPs inserting the 'racism section'"""" 

I inserted facts documenting instances of named sources accusing Catherine Glick of racism.  I'd like to take a moment to address comments in the """"For the attention of the IPs inserting the 'racism section.'""""

Please do not misinterpret documentation of allegations of racism for allegations themselves.  The section inserted, apparently subject to some controversy, is """"accusations of recism.""""  In that section, the accusations of racism that several writersEileen Read, Alex Pareene, and Paul J. Balleshave leveled at Caroline Glick are documented.  Properly, no opinion or point of view has been expressed in the """"Allegations of racism"""" section as to the veracity of these allegations.  

1.  I therefore cannot understand why documenting such allegations could be considered controversial, let alone """"potentially libelous"""" as you say.  The documentation of specific allegations of racism by named sources need only prove that such allegations exist, not their veracity.  Documentation of written defenses of Ms. Glick's work are solicited and in fact highly encouraged.  

2.  I apologize for linking to www.youtube.com.  The link I should have used was the one from Ms. Glick's homepage.  That link is at: http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2010/06/we-con-the-world-the-gaza-fl.php

3.  I never claimed to be other than a single user even though, incidentally, all of the contributions to the """"Allegations of racism"""" section are not mine.  

Incidentally, if it matters, I for my part am a fan of Ms. Glick's work and do not believe that she is a racist.  I contributed to the section to advance the Wikipedia mission to provide a forum where issues of public significance can be documented in a way as to provide reasoned information to the public.  one of Ms. Glick's detractors, Eileen Read, wrote an article in the Huffington Post accusing Ms. Glick of racism and asking that she be fired.  The article is making rounds all over the internet and has likely been read by hundreds of thousands, if not many more.  It'd be a great shame from my perspective if Ms. Glick's career suffered as a result of such charges (since they are, in my own personal view, baseless)such charges should be documented neutrally and weighed against the writings of Ms. Glick and her defenders, aiming only to inform the public, which can then decide.  When I inserted a reference arguing that Ms. Glick's positions are """"not racist"""" but """"common sense,"""" it was taken down by those same persons invoking BLP standards and undue weight.

Perhaps we should work on that section here.  Here's the text, which I've started making an effort to clean up... although it needs a lot more work.
Oh, and the page should probably be all Harvard refs, rather than none:  Wikipedia usually sticks with the style chosen by the first author.    

Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  

Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave """"two rules"""" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  """"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it."""" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)

Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  

Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is """"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium"""" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  

It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that """"hostility seemed to pervade the data"""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:

""""In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness."""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)

In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

""""Race, and this is clear also from the definitions above, is irrelevant as a Jew may have no Jewish parents, and be equally Jewish as all other Jews. Very much like being American or Dutch.""""

In case ethnicity is not a result of race, it mostly is a result of nationality. So apart from """"Dutch"""" in racial sence (the autochtone, blond, blue-eyed, Northern-Europide sub-sub race), there is """"Dutch"""" in the sence of having the Dutch nationality, in other words a Dutch passport.
Maybe there's not a thing like the Jewish nationality (any more), as the autochtone inhabitants of Judea fled their country, when it came to defending it, and since then spread all over the world. Attempts, to get their natural place back have succeeded  to a certain extent, but as that country now is called """"Israel"""", the corresponding nationality is called """"Israelian"""" and not """"Jewish"""" any more.

""""For many years I had an East-African-born girlfriend - whose race is considered different from mine - but we both considered ourselves and were considered in our community Jews and as Jews felt particularly comfortable with each other and each other's customs.""""
 
There are also East-African-born persons, who are to a certain extent Jewish in racial sence.  But if that was'nt the case with this person, than a question is, in how far she's still ethnically Jewish, since Gdorb obviously doesn't """"have that girlfriend"""" any more. One doesn't get some ethnicity, just by being somebody elses friend for some weeks, months or years. 

""""Ethnicity is an old instrument for disregarding race.""""

Why should one (use instruments to) disregard one's own or somebody else's race?
Race is a biological reality and in principle there's nothing in it, that gives reason to disregard it. On the contrary, one might say. Many, if not most, people are proud of their race. If some prefer to disregard it, than a question is, for what reason they do.

"""" There are even older ones (affection, attraction, humanity, respect, exchange, etc.) and many newer ones and they must all scare the hell out of you.""""

Instead it operates on an anachronistic rule-based paradigm that wobbles to what the most dominant Wikipedia editors believe.  When it comes to characterizing living persons, that paradigm is demonstrably fraught with errors that are nigh impossible to fix.

There are famous cases in history when the vast majority of people held laughable misconceptions.  But science is an arduous process, and many dedicated scientists have suffered grievously for having the temerity to displace a popular misconception with a superior theory grounded in evidence and reasoning.

Getting people to honestly question their assumptions and conscientiously examine both their assumptions and the evidence for them is one of the recurring challenges in science education.

Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious

The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin. While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the """"imperial crown"""" - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   """,0

 That date of """"1957"""" is not a date of publication; it is more likely a date of composition (which the site tends to use more than dates of publicationsee below).  The play was published first in 1958 in a literary magazine (Encore) and subsequently published by various publishers such as Methuen (in the UK) and Grove Press (in the US), in various revised editions.  One needs to do more advanced research to make such distinctions among possible dates of composition and dates of publication accurately.  Pinter's works have a very complex compositional and publishing history.  Please see the """"Bio-bibliographical Note"""" hosted on the Nobel Prize site for related critical resources if one wants more accurate information than is currently in this Wikipedia entry.  The entry still needs substantial revision and editing.

[I'm adding a cleanup tag on the article.]
Dates on Pinter's website often tend to be dates of final composition and/or dates of first performance and not dates of first publication and/or dates of (film/tv) release.  (Several sections of his website were compiled by research assistants tasked with such work and by his (multiple) assistants beginning in around 2000, when the website was launched.  There are sometimes typographical and other errors in the sections.)  Some works were published long after they were first written; e.g. his novel The Dwarfs.  When not confusing, one tries to use those dates or clarifies discrepancies otherwise.  Did some cleanup of this article.

 Parting thoughts on Jmh649 RFAR 
This is getting posted on every arb's talk page and I will courtesy notify Doc J. I am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk. We've seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections, edit wars, hounding new users, involved blocks, etc, and absolutely nothing gets done about it. Why? So Doc J can """"adjust""""? What about all his victims? What do they get?diddly squat, just like in the real world. I actually truly hope Doc J can change, but that is not what wiki history teaches us. Wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he'll be back at RFAR within 6-30 months from now. Just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on Willbeback but didn't and what happened? Will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later, Will loses his bit and gets banned. And Doc J gets to use a secret mentor? He'd only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor, such as the mentor wasn't neutral or some such reason. By not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments, especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs (ie, how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior) all AC did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do whatever they want and get away with it scott free. This juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in AC's rulings on admins. At a minimum AC should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the RFAR. This is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and AC will pay for many times over in the future. The UN can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and AC can, and that's really sad. This is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf. See you at """"RFAR/Jmh649 2"""". talk """,0
"This is a question best raised on the NoScript support forums. However, I can comment on a few of the differences:
 CSP is server-side (has to be configured at each server, sends reports to the server), while ABE is client-side (configured in browser, logs results in error console).
 CSP just allows or blocks content, whereas ABE can take other actions like stripping authentication.
 CSP was primarily designed to stop cross-site scripting and other injections, while ABE was primarily designed to stop cross-site request forgery (but can defeat XSS/injections too).
 CSP allows wildcards, ABE allows either wildcards or regular expressions.
 CSP specifies only hostnames, ABE can specify full addresses including protocol and path.
 ABE knows about intranet vs internet addresses and can control traffic between them (in fact, it does this by default).
 CSP doesn't try to control requests originating from privileged code eg browser extensions. ABE can, although it is always possible for privileged code to defeat this, so it cannot be relied on to protect against malicious addons.
 ABE can distinguish between different types of object inclusions and different HTTP methods.
 They can work independently; if either blocks something, it will be blocked.
 I don't know of any metrics on how widely CSP is deployed, nor do I have any idea how many NoScript users take the time to configure ABE (which doesn't do very much out-of-the-box).",0
"Hi, Benne. Thank you for unearthing this need for disambiguation. I think that Mansura is usually spelled with a ta marbuta as its final letter: منصورة (manṣūrä). This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —",0

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system.

Well, thank you so much for your reply. I hoped you would! About six months ago I noticed how badly ballroom dancing in general was being treated on WP, and decided to do something about it. I had been taught dancing by someone who had taken tuition in the latin dances from Pierre & Lavelle, so I knew their names from being a teenager in the 1950s. I wish now I had taken the trouble to meet them, but I didn't. Since I'm something of an expert on Cuban music I decided to start with the group of dancers who started LA dancing in England, from where it has spread all over the world. 

I soon discovered the lack of reliable reference sources was the main problem. I kept seeing references to Pierre, but it was ages before I had enough to put up the page on WP. I still don't have enough for Lavelle. With difficult cases I start a Word file offline. Anything on WP gets copied by bots and plagiarised widely. Even these personal pages.

I've got copies of all the books written about LA dances at that time, including both Dimitri's books and Pierre's book. I don't know where you are, of course, but if you are somewhere in England, we might arrange to meet, and you could have a look at the books. It sounds as though you don't have a copy of his first book.

I've tried to interview all the survivors from that time. So far, I've only found two. I'd certainly like to meet your father if he was willing. He's bound to have lots of things tucked away at the back of his mind which might help us. And I'll answer more fully about myself, but not on WP (for reason given above)

Okay, I am fine with the re-branding of the first two articles listed above.  However, the wholesale elimination of background information, particularly the strategic overview, removes the historic context for these military exercises.  Finally, I think it is bad policy and disrespectful for these editors to make such sweeping changes to articles that I created, and would not exist except through my efforts, without first consulting me and discussing these changes.

 Veritas (that's latin for truth boys and girls) 

Before the next one of you redneck fuckwits 'corrects' my inclusion of fair and informative photographs (most of which were taken by members of the US Military, all of which have endlessly appeared in international news media, and none of which anyone is claiming to be fake - correct me if i'm wrong on this-), answer me the following:

If the wings sheared off on impact, where are they in the photographs? 
(and if anybody starts talking about airliner 'vaporisation' on here, then wikipedia is already worthless and I am wasting my time. its like a film trailer: """"From the people who brought you the magic bullet and WMDs, comes a story beyond all rationality."""")

If the plane hit the ground before impact, why is the lawn unmarked?

A 757 impact is either:
(a) strong enough to bring down a steel reinforced world trade centre
or:
(b) not even strong enough to create more than a 9 metre hole in three concrete sections of the pentagon.
 (i'll give you a clue, both these things cannot be true)

"""== Should be listed under """"Animation villains"""" ==

Awhile back I edited the article to put Megatron into the categories of the following:

""""Fictional mass murderers""""
""""Fictional evil geniuses""""
""""Animation villains""""

The first two have since been kept, but the third one was quickly taken out, but I was alright with that happening, since I assume the person who removed it figured that because he is listed under """"Predacons"""" and """"Vehicons"""", his status as a villain is already there (since both the article for Vehicon and the article for Predacon are listeed under """"Villain groups""""), and so actually listing Megatron as a villain would be completely redundant.  However, I now see that the original Megatron IS listed under """"Animation villains"""", as is Galvatron, despite both also being listed under their respective villainous Transformers factions, which themselves are listed as """"Villain groups"""".  There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category """"Animation villains"""".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders.

BI, you said you wanted to talk

At the bottom of the lead section you have written:

""""Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator, but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts. In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials"""".""""

Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed """"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials""""

That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10.  The full quote is

""""If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,
then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly
feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in
the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher
operational temperatures.""""

It then goes on to say

""""As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL
tethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:
“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make
the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”""""

So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with """"presently available commercial materials.""""

To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states

""""The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is
technically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will
allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space
tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into
Earth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design
solution using existing, or near-term technologies. We expect that a number of the other
HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to
detailed design studies. The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically
reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access.""""

Regarding: """"but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts."""" and

So Strawberry Hills Hotel was proposed for deletion by Wheelchair Epidemic, Ecoleetage agreed and NawlinWiki deleted it.

"""==bcm versus km³==
Dear Gene Nygaard,
You said that generally everyone understands km³. I am not sure about this statement and find this use quite unusual and misleading. Could you please give any example in gas industry where km³ is used (maybe just some newspaper article)? Also, if youd could find any article in wikipeedia about gas fileds or pipelines, which use km³, I would like to get a reference.  

Google """"natural gas"""" """"km3""""  823 hits

Note that Google, as far as I know, won't search for the ³ character, but this gets those that use either html superscripts, or just """"km3"""" and the like.

There are other ways to find more of them.  You will of course find many using bcm as well.  But as I pointed out, that may be jargon used within the industry, but it is not known outside the industry (there might possibly be other little pockets of its usage in other contexts, even less known). 

another search, on AltaVista:
km³ """"natural gas"""" 3130 hits. 

AltaVista appears to treat ³ and 3 as synonymous, unlike Google. You can limit them to .gov sites, or to .edu sites, too, to see that this isn't """"newspaper usage"""" but in fact more likely to take place in more serious and professional contexts.  

BTW, if you were arguing about """"tcf"""" you'd maybe have a better case.  That is common enough in the industry, more so than """"bcm"""", that it is better known outside the industry, too.  

I am able to use different search engages. However, could you please give any example of use km³  as an unit of capacity of gas pipeline? Concerning tcf (trillion cubic feet) - it's used more in the US gas industry, while bcm is used mainly in Europe. Don't see problem with this. If you look the external links of this artcile, you will find both: tcf and bcm, depending of the source.

 In the petroleum industry the unit systems used are Oilfield and Metric like what was mentoned above, all depending on where you are and who you are working with. However I have never come across km³ being used to describe gas field sizes or gas production and if someone was to describe a field or gas production in such a way to someone in the industry it would have no revelace to them, it is not a standard of unit. It would have to be Bcm, Mcm, E3M3, Bcf, Tcf, MMscf, Mscf etc.   

Surely, we writing for a general audience not only for people in certain industries.  km³ is standard SI if some people in some industry want to use something else, then that's their problem.  P.S. Hello Gene. ɪmp 

 Very true Jimp we are writing for a general audience. And when i searched some news articles by the likes of Forbes, CNN Money etc on Google news in the past month for the phrase km3 in relation to gas/gasfield/ gas field/ """"natural gas"""" it returns one result from Petroleum World. However the units tcf, bcf, bcm return   at least 102, 147,  51 hits when used with the above phrases. And these are from Forbes, Reuters, CNN Money, Globe and mail which i think you would agree are also writing for the General Audience. The numbers are in their hundreds of thousands when you do just a general web search for tcf, bcf and bcm compared to the 823 km3 turns up. So its not really just """"some people in some industry"""" using these terms.  Cheers  
Sure it is.  But that's beside the point; we at Wikipedia choose to use standard unit symbols, not all the various off-the-cuff possibilities, and km³ is the standard symbol for 1,000,000,000 m³.  It isn't surprising at all that financial magazines are too innumerate when it comes to units of measure to even understand what they are, so sure they get passed on unchanged.  So what?

Hello Jim,

Help please. I am new to wikipedia and surely lacking sufficient skills. I finished a new article on a new subject matter """"Virtus Economic Theory and Model"""". I used the wizard to write it. It is currently in Draft form and wished to know: a) what happens next? 
b) how do I (or someone else in Wikipedia) transform this article from a Draft status to a live one? 
c) how can I benefit from someones more experienced to look over/edit the draft - do what is necessary to turn it into a formal article.

Many thanks and all the best.

If someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively, it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken. It is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered, and to give the editor a chance to stop. In fact, a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first. I do think that more friendly wording might have been used, rather than  """"I will report you to Wikipedia admins and have you blocked"""", but I have seen far more uncivil warnings than that. The IP editor has just given you that one message since your last edit to the article, and, since you say that you are """"done with"""" the article, it may be that he/she will leave it at that. If the IP editor persists in posting to you about it after you have stopped editing the article, then please come back and tell me, as that may well be harassment, and action may well be needed, but if what has happened so far is the end of it, then I don't see any reason for not just letting it drop.

"oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula. 

Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.

Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that. Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal! SM/DF's behaviour is still way of the mark. It is as if Adam goes onto wiki with the basic approach of 'now where can I cause grief today?'. And we have all had enough of it.  05:15 Apr 13, 2003 (UTC)",0

 Re 

I don't understand you anymore. Until now i thought that you were an editor that has nothing to do but track my contributions and criticise me. But now i see that you throw all kinds of accusations that aren't true and that have the role of discouraging me in making future contributions. I say to you not to worry because everything you say against me or my contributions means absolutely nothing for me and sadly my oppinion of you just dropped to a level even lower than hell. I saw that you had all kinds of trouble in the Romanian Wikipedia on the same subject of blatantly criticising users and honestly i think you should keep your bad thoughts to yourself and try to help others a lot more. Instead of criticising and accusing you should try to help an article by adding what's missing or something else because ultimatelly you are an editor and nobody is perfect.

 Why delete without notice? 

It is my understanding that articles are not removed without discussion or notification.   The flag itself assures this.   It has been less than 24 hours since I submitted my first wiki article - and twice in that time I have had my article removed  without notice,  without comment on my defense points and  without opportunity to make edits. (with the exception of one who answered my response back to them - and I thank them)  

I am new here.  I posted my article to wiki.   The first administrator came along and made a minor change to my title.   I had modeled my after multiple examples of others in the same industry as posted to wiki - but not really a big concern to me. Happy to learn best practice and perhaps the other 5 articles are not good examples.  

I then had a user flag my article for speedy delete. 

Very quickly - A second administrator deleted my article.  If I'm reading the chain correctly - it was deleted something like less than 10 minutes after flagged.   No one notified me. No one gave me the opportunity to make changes or instructions as to where the specific problem was.  

Per the """"item deleted"""" page that suggests you work with the other parties involved, I first contacted the user that flagged my article and the administrator who deleted it.  The user said his concern was that it sounded to him like advertising and noted on what points.  I wrote a very detailed response to him telling why the information he noted was presented as it was, addressing his source concerns, etc..   He has not followed up with me - I assume that means no problem with my response?  Or perhaps busy doing other things.  

I also forwarded the defense response to the administrator who deleted my file.   Before sending the him points of defense (I was still drafting), he did send me a note saying it was an """"advertising"""" concern.  He pointed me to a general help page (which I'd already read) and a page where I could retrieve the original version of my article.  Combined with the point to the article - and no reply to my defense - I took this to mean Go again with it.  

I reposted the article - and had another user flag it for advertising - but no specific information.  I removed the tag per the box's instruction that I could do so as long as working on resolving the problem.  I responded to the flagger in great detail and requested specific feedback.  (which was then deleted and marked as too much detail) I replied again in a more brief response.   I added the hang on notation.  

I am now addressing you because you have deleted my article - without any comment or notice to me.  I assure you that I am not being difficult - but am very frustrated with the lack of interaction and guidance I am receiving here.  It seems easy to hit a delete - but of little interest to provide anything specific like assistance.  Am I wrong to assume administrators are supposed to be a source for information and assistance - wiki mentors if you will.  My experience on my first day using wiki has been that administrators shoot first - and don't care in the least about even asking questions later.  In fact - they will ignore them.  

I do not believe you could have read the contents of the talk page in the period of time lapse between the flag and your delete.   I expect that before deleting my article - one would check the talk page and see if the matter is being addressed.  This is what the flag box ASSURES me that is wiki policy to do.  I have extensive notes on the article sources and answered all questions in a very timely fashion - but I cannot understand why I seem to be the only person following a procedure.  

I hope this is simply a matter of catching a couple of administrators on """"off"""" days.  I am very frustrated with the lack of administrators following what I understand to be their own policies.   Please review my talk page and advise.  I also respectfully request that you reinstate my article.
I await your response.""",0

Your points echo mine very closely Hoary. The person who wrote the article Daisuke Kawasaki is not a noted music critic or industry person, he owned a small fanzine called Beikoku Ongaku (which is linked in Bbb24's source) and published it with his wife, but it is now defunct. If you look at their companies website http://www.beikoku-ongaku.com/ they are now selling """"Collagen Beauty Drinks"""", whatever that is.

I'd just like to point out that while it may seem trivial to argue about, people use the wikipedia for information and silly claims like this spin out of control and escalate into utter nonsense. Journalists, researchers etc do use the wikipedia to get a lot of their information quickly. The articles are making it sound like an achievement or hallmark in Japanese popular music, when it is not. Lists by the British Film Institute etc are different as they are made via a consensus with the worlds leading critics and industry persons and an explanation is provided as to why each film was chosen etc. What is being contested by me is just a random list that is noted by the publisher as being biased and arbitrary (which means chosen randomly with no reasoning) This is like a TV network saying the views of such and such do not reflect those of the station. It's pretty bad when the publisher prints a disclaimer on the cover next to what it's advertising.27.33.143.93  """,0

Those flight logs had not been available for over 30 years, and even then, likely only to Bush's superiors in the Air Guard/USAF. The pro-forgery claims may start as a big pile, but item by item, it shrinks down to nothing under close scrutiny. The """"they are real"""" pile starts off a bit smaller, but even after you take out CBS's incompetent, dumbass handling of them, there is still a pile left.

You also ignored my requests to wait until an Admin settles this, and then lied saying that """"I want to work together with you"""" when it appears you have no intention. The record is all there. Why you continue to lie in the face of the record being present is appalling. You yourself need to read this: How experienced editors avoid being dragged into edit wars.

Don't edit war.
Don't simply state your position over and over, without explaining your underlying concerns and interests.
Don't canvass other editors who agree with you.
Don't give up when people disagree on a specific proposal.
Don't take a hard line position to extract concessions from other editors. This often backfires, and undermines the reasonableness of your viewpoint.

Yes, the presentation of God and cosmology in TUB is exactly that and so is just a fact of the book. If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts?

However, because very few prostate cancers were detected at Gleason scores of 8 to 10, it is difficult to draw conclusions about this group.""""

"Hello, the Heleen Mees article is now full of nonsense. Mees never was an employee of the european Commission, the 2006 article about women (not) working was not her first article in NRC Handelsblad. She had published quite a bit before that. Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 
Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]
In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]
In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]",0
"Reply to FyzixFighter 

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0

How does one mark a reference as questionable.  While I was able to find a blog mention of the """"feat"""" of him running 9.0 , the person writing the blog was unnamed and gave reference to an out of print book """"The Super Athletes"""" by David Willoughby, which I later tracked to being published in 1970.

Very little science involved. Take it with many huge grains of salt.""""  Later in the same blog, he cites the unbelievability of this one mark as substance for such a statement.

It is not necessary to bring talk pages to publishing standards, so there is no need to correct typing errors, grammar, etc. It tends to irritate the users whose comments you are correcting.  

Never edit someone's words to change their meaning. Editing others' comments is not allowed. There are exceptions, however. Some are:
 If you have their permission
 Removing prohibited material such as libel and personal details
 Removing personal attacks and incivility. This is controversial, and many editors do not feel it is acceptable; please read WP:ATTACK#Removal of text and WP:CIVIL#Removing uncivil comments before removing anything.
 Unsigned comments: You are allowed to append  or one of its variants to the end of someone's comment if they have failed to sign it. The form is {{subst:unsigned|USER NAME OR IP}}, which results in —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) ..
 Interruptions: In some cases, it is OK to interrupt a long contribution, either by a short comment (as a reply to a minor point) or by a headline (if the contribution introduces a new topic). In that case, add """"Headline added to (reason) by ~~~~""""). In such cases, please add {{subst:interrupted|USER NAME OR IP}} before the interruption.
 When a long comment has formatting errors, rendering it difficult to read. In this case, restrict the edits to formatting changes only and preserve the content as much as possible.

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

I have noticed that it seems to be a British tendency to use """"which"""" instead of """"that"""", but I've seen and heard Americans use them interchangeably too. In informal English (especially spoken), many use either which in lieu of that regardless of circumstance, and it is considered acceptable to do so in most instances. In more formal encyclopedic prose though, I think the grammatical precision is necessary. I hope someone who has more knowledge in this area can help me out here.   """,0

Disputing """"Job Guarantee"""" Section
Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)""",0

Boy, this is the most understated thing I've read here on Wikipedia.  While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.  Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another, and some decidedly non-Mormon communities as well.  The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City, South Dakota.

In addition, a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah, including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the """"Mormons"""" and the """"Gentiles"""" during the territorial days of Utah.  Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.

Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here.  The LDS Church owned the store lock, stock, and barrel.  And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.

 E pluribus unum = 13 letters 

Symbolically, the phrase E pluribus unum has 13 letters (as does annuit coeptis). This example of gematria (isopsephy) then represents the 13 colonies becoming the United States. The back of the US 2010 penny features E pluribus unum and a shield with 13 vertical stripes. The back of the US dollar includes these 13 letters among 13 symbolic references to the number 13. - p. 121, The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill by David Ovason (Harper Collins, 2004)

The ancient practice of Hebrew gematria/Greek isopsephy/Arabic gematria (and modern Simple[6,74] English[7,74] Gematria[8,74]) appears to primarily concentrate on the gematric sums of words/names, i.e. Sargon=74 (S19+a1+r18g7+o15+n14). But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of """"God is ever a geometer"""", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  """,0

"United Kingdom
I think the United Kingdom itself maybe be emerging to be an early 21st century super power with the US as the world hyper power. Here's the reasons for me thinking this:
Second to the US in world diplomacy
Second highest defence budget
Second largest navy in terms of tonnage
Second most power projection capability
Second largest aircraft carrier fleet with second largest aircraft carries being built after the Nimitz aircraft carriers
UN Security Council seat and founding member
Head of the Commonwealth of Nations (the largest organisation of states after the UN)
The British monarch is also Head of State of 15 other countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Major player in NATO and EU
Large North Sea oil and gas production
London being one of the greatest cities in the world 
City of London being the world's main financial centre in terms of number of amount of money that passes through it each year and largest gathering of financial groups.
Pound Sterling one of the world's top currencies alongside US Dollar and Euro
Second highest growth for major developed economies after US.
Its own nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines which have joint longest range with US nuclear submarines
Largest number of over seas territories
Carried out major invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
Was only the nation to actually invade Afghanistan and Iraq alongside US forces (Other forces came after US & UK forces had secured the countries)
Second largest force in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Leads the fight against Afghan rebels in Helmand province
Controls southern Iraq and large areas of Afghanistan
Leads NATO force in Kosovo
The leading nation in tackling global warming
A leading country in the Middle East road map to peace
Most involved in Darfur issue
Second most involved in Iran nuclear issue
Single handedly resolved Sierra Leone issue
I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN. Not to mention its influence and veto power of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",0

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0

"Self-promotion, is it then?  There is no Jacobite activity after Henry, except in culture and the Whig-Tory conflicts actually on British soil.

Where was their interaction at all with any Jacobites in history, except fanboys like yourself who intrude in their lives and annoy them with these fallacious claims?  Sure, some of those dead people knew the Jacobites and helped them out.  Whether I like it or not, the Hanoverians rightfully succeeded to the House of Stuart.

""""In 1952 BMW in West Germany produced its first car since before the Second World War. The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.

These cars had some success in post-imperial Britain where there was no Marshall Plan and the Suez Crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. But Germany in the late 1950s was enjoying the fruits of Wirtschaftswunder. The country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the BMW Isetta Motor-Coupé, known colloquially but never popularly as “the egg”""""

Extract from: Car Wars, Fifty Years of Greed, Treachery, and Skulduggery in the Global Marketplace by Jonathan Mantle

But then there was a fuel crisis and so, briefly, the Germans bought it. What a happy happy accident.

""""The BMW Isetta. Despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship, BMW laid a multimillion dollar egg in the 1950s with its Isetta minicar, sneeringly dubbed, “das rollende Ei” or “the rolling egg” The Isetta’s engine was in the rear; passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a D-Day troop carrier. In fact, when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. As for safety, the entire vehicle, front to back, was one big crumple zone.

Steering the Isetta was difficult, largely because its body was tapered towards the rear, like a wedge of Emmenthaler cheese. Most models had only three wheels, which didn’t make the car any easier to control. But the design enabled the manufacturers to have the Isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.""""

Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

 RE: Just The Facts Ma'am... 

Hello Diligent...

Adding well documented statements of fact that directly contradict a candidates own current """"Official Position"""" is healthy in a free and open forum like wikipedia.  Like with others who are critical, I don't see you being critical of editors who only make reference to un-encyclopedic sources such as a candidate own controlled web page or an un-referenced list of """"official positions"""". According to your reasoning, the political positions section of each candidates page might as well be a direct link to their own web site or positions list from their own hard drive.

As for me I will continue to promote wikipedia as a free medium where by the lobbyests and special interests do not have a corrupting advantage over the rest of us. This is not in violation of any wiki rules and is in fact extactly what we are supposed to be encouraging in this free and open forum where the well referenced facts rule.  As for you...

  Sir/Maam:

Thank You ! For the heads up about needing to sign corrections to pages. All of the information I have added to the article on Walter Butler, the Loyalist, can easily be verified by using “www.footnote.com” for the Revolutionary Pension Applications or by consulting the """"Bloodied Mohawk"""", which Picton Press and I published in 2000, which footnotes the primary source document of every fact printed within the book. I think it important to note that the """"Pensioners"""" name possibly three different Patriots as the killer of Walter Butler. I have posted on my website “www.fort-plank.com” a page with all of the known references to Walter Butler's death which can be readily found in PRIMARY SOURCE materials. I hate using secondary and tertiary sources for obvious reasons and am very pleased that “wikipedia.org” has dramatically increased its documentation requirements for its articles! Thank You!

Please do not add original research or novel syntheses of previously published material to our articles as you apparently did to Walter Butler (Loyalist). Please cite a reliable source for all of your information. Thank you. Deconstructhis (talk) 

I must in all fairness ask what the problem is with “original research? Are you implying that original and authentic research is not appropriate for “Wikipedia”. There is way, way to much trash out there on the “internet” which cannot be, in any way, verified. My additions to the Butler page were not suppositions, rather eyewitness statements as to what really happened to Butler. 

Unfortunately, the webmaster of http://www.nyhistory.net/~drums/wbutler.htm is a personal and friendly acquaintance of mine, but he, and many other historians have bought into the early undocumented histories of the Mohawk Valley, most of which I have spent the last twenty-five plus years trying to authenticate as at least seventeen of my own ancestors fought in the Mohawk Valley during the Revolution, and regurgitated their unbelievable and unverifiable “facts” as their own research.

Please, do not misunderstand: I am not upset, get confused!!! I would really like to see all of the content of the Internet be so reliable that anyone could simply look it up on the web and then contact the repository of the original document, pay the appropriate fee for copying it, and then have their own private library of primary source documents.

Hope this finds all well!

P.S. The “copyrighted material” that I incorrectly posted in Wikipedia was an article entirely of my own production and which was copied from my master copies of the 100+ pages of primary source data on my “www.fort-plank.com” site. This can be easily verified by my publisher, Picton Press, and a plethora of fellow researchers, some of whom agree with me and some who do not.""",0

Personally, I agree with the general usage, like I said, I think its much of the same reason that the history is a separate page and text submission isn't credited in the article either - accessibility, readability and standardization.  I don't see a compelling reason yet to change the guidelines - in this case, there was another free image available without the caption concern.

He and a few others at the Sikh-History.com are bent on propagating their views without any backing from SGGS or other recorded evidence. A lot of the Sikh history is being twisted by these people at their site. They will go to any lengths to promote their views.

Unfortunately, I do not at present have the time to deal with these people but I think that their approach of promoting their views under the Sikhism banner is deplorable and needs to be restrained.

That is a bit much to tackle all at once, so I'll start with the basics. Your edits removed a reliable source dealing directly with the topic (namely, the article from the St. Petersburg Times). Your edit also added material from a source which I believe is unencyclopedic and fails this site's sourcing policies. Both aspects make the article poorer. I will go into more detail once I have time to fully digest your argument, but for now, the Times article is entitled """"Doctor's syndrome a sham, board says"""". Our article reflects the content of that reliable source. I don't see any similarly reliable independent, fact-checked, third-party sources that have appeared in the intervening years to contradict that assessment - certainly the Board left the door open for medical science to corroborate Wilson's claims, but I see no reliably sourced evidence that such corroboration has occurred.

Historical Context

The Germans had bombed many cities and civilian targets throughout England throughout the war, in addition to many other cities throughout Europe in the opening invasions. The British Bomber Command began a policy of Area Bombing, or targeting cities to demoralize the population, disrupt the infrastructure, and as a method of taking revenge for the bombing of British cities. The Nazis were widely popular, and encountered no resistance from non Jews, non Communists, or any other Germans who were not exterminated by the Nazis. The use of incendiary bombs was also similar to the burning of Jews in concentration camp ovens, which the Germans had given their consent to.

 Re: Thanks for restoring links 
Hi; you're quite welcome. I didn't think you removed the interlanguage links intentionally. The spam/vandalism was indeed added by 221.197.20.66—the same spammer/vandal returned today via 221.198.74.212. Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter. With any luck, a developer will see the request before too long. Once the domain is on the filter, a page containing the domain cannot be saved (annoyingly, there are ways to get around this, but it usually takes care of the problem).

 Zone system 

I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. 

Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording """"dynamic range"""" and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer. 

Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...

However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.  05:52, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Hi Vincent:
Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things? (I'd say that unless there is a large public misimpression that he was dogmatic it's not worth mentioning, no more than it's necessary to mention that every painter or sculptor or engineer held other approaches to various disciplines were equally valid.)

Here's the problem with """"dynamic range,"""" Vincent: it's inaccurate jargon. (It's oft-used and familiar jargon, but sloppy and inaccurate nonetheless.) First, it's redundant. The meaning most attribute to """"dy",0

 With liberty and justice for all. 

In response to a claim that liberalism does not advocate equality.

The foundational documents of liberalism stress both freedom and equality.  """"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal...""""

We know those high ideals were expressed by a man who owned slaves, and that while we are much closer to true equality today, we still have a way to go.  Still, one of the two principles that unite liberals is the idea of equality, in the sense of equal rights.  The liberal movement has consistently been in that direction, with equality for Negros first, then for women, maybe someday for homosexuals.  

By equality, I mean equality before the law  obviously all men are not equal at birth, but the law should not favor those born with greater advantages.  Sometimes equality and freedom conflict.  My freedom to own slaves conflicts with the slave's equality under the law.  But more often the two ideals are complementary.  My equal rights give me the freedom to walk down the sidewalk without the law telling me I must step into the gutter to allow a better man to pass.

 Some things about the Dutch and German education systems 
The Dutch name """"Hoger beroepsonderwijs"""" (abbrev. as HBO, though HBO (disambiguation) links to the misspelled redirect Hoger Beroeps Onderwijs) links here, but this seems to be in error, as they are not the same.

An example of such an organisation is the Hanzehogeschool Groningen. They are not allowed to use the Dutch word for """"university"""" in their Dutch name but  but rather are what we call a Hogeschool, and what German call Fachhochschule, to confuse the world, they often call themselves """"university of applied sciences"""" in the English language.

No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.

 As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.

 In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.  Hence, you'll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted.",0

 Proper pronunciation of NVIDIA?? 

I'll ask one more time, very, very seriously:  Can anyone cite a reliable written source which definitively says how the NVIDIA muckamucks intend for """"NVIDIA"""" to be pronounced?  For some time now, the article said /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/, but someone changed it just now to say /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/.

As I said several months ago (see Talk:Nvidia#The way it's meant to be pronounced? above), I am, personally, absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that NVIDIA's own pronunciation of its name (based on the audio of the animated logo at the start of a recent game) is /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (""""inn-VID-ee-uh"""", with the first two vowels being identical).  I know some other people seem equally absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that the correct pronunciation is /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (""""en-VID-ee-uh""""), and the only explanation I can come up with for this discrepancy is that those people's speech may have the """"pin-pen merger"""" (please go read that if you aren't familiar with the term) — whereas my own speech does not have the pin-pen merger, and I therefore """"hear"""" the pronunciation differently from some other people.  Or, perhaps the person whose voice was recorded for the NVIDIA animated logo happens to speak a regional dialect with the pin-pen merger, and none of the NVIDIA execs have noticed or cared.

My first impulse, just now, was to simply revert the latest edit and put the text back the way it was before (/ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/).  My second impulse was to leave it as it now is, but put a {{fact}} tag on the pronunciation until someone can supply a reliable source.  But if no one can come up with a source, I believe it's better not to give any pronunciation until/unless it can be reliably sourced.    """,0

Yeah, they really exist. You need at least one w-3 (one FA from that class) and one w-6 (one from that class) and you can make the others from them (a few carnivores species need more). Essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition, where, for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids, sugar, vitamins and minerals (fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as IV formulas). The reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w-9, and you NEED w-6 and w-3 fatty acids to make lipids (the w-3 DHA is your most common neural tissue fat).  I'll see what I can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. There is some quackery out there (like pills that contain w-9 because olive oil is cheap) but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking, actually, unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly.  BTW, there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. This destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all PUFAs. On such a diet, even DOGS get severe atherosclerosis, and they are species highly resistant to it (their HDLs are higher than their LDLs). So all this is quite fascinating.  """,0

Also, NOP want a good of whole naation without looking at religion/politics beliefs and skin color. You think that NOP is anti-semitic ? Jan Mosdorf is a NOP's hero, guess what ? Mosdorf was a Jew who died in Auschwitz during the Holocaust time. Above that, NOP members never attacked any Jew during its 25 years of excisting and never calls for destroying any Synagouges in Poland. Look at the NOP's forum when its topic about destroyed Jewish tombs - read the reaction of members and stop spreading your hateress among normal and patriotic people. We are not Combat 18 or Blood&Honour;, we are Polish patriots and we will never agree with the neo-nazi actions against anything Polish, such as Polish Jews, but you will never understand this as long as you don't live in Poland.

Notability of Jake kesler

Firstly, I have to point out that academic presses have never stopped rolling regarding Northern Ireland and Irish/UK politics. As I say from time to time, printing presses by and large print round the clock, esp 'academic' ones. If you can find them, you will have a pool of scores of thousands of sources on the subject, saying pretty-much whatever you want them to.

Secondly, to give quotes that follow the sovereign-only interpretation of 'country' is simply misleading people. Not everyone follows that strict meaning of the term. By the standards of these quotes, Wales, England and Scotland are not countries either. You can't have it both ways.

You say of calling Northern Ireland a """"country"""": """"It would cause uproar, not only among nationalists but among different strands of unionism in Northern Ireland too, and would be very much contrary to the supposed spirit of the """"new Northern Ireland"""". It is this highly politicised tone that I am objecting to. Where do British Unionists object to NI being called a """"country"""" in the sense of Wales et el? When you say """"the supposed spirit of the """"new Northern Ireland"""" you seem to be essentially claiming that the new Northern Ireland is more a part of the Republic of Ireland than in was before. The reality is that NI is now less part of the UK, and less part of the ROI. As I write, the episode of 'Coast' on Northern Ireland is on TV, and it is just reminding me of how the NI article is Wikipedia's most shamefully negligent article: something I proved with examples over a year ago. It is bereft of locality and positivity. The more recent generations in NI expect a country to grow up in, not an abstract story, or a 'nowhere place' - they have one in every needed sense, except the minds of those who need to put their on need and idea of nationalism first.

About previous stuff, what I understand mostly is that you have not liked me or others generating minimal stub articles, unless a certain threshold of development or need is met, a threshold that you set differently than i have.  I don't want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i've been working on recently are good or bad.  These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.

Sorry, your code is even unclearer than that in the article. Where did you pull the 18 from, for example? Non-experts of Python won't know that the return format of bin(a) will have a 0b prefix. Note that Python is used here as pseudocode, so it's better to avoid assuming much knowledge of the Python standard library.   

The Python code in the article suffers from two problems:
1) It's unclear what kind of value each variable holds. The variables should either be renamed to something self-descriptive, or a comment should explain the role of each.
2) The code is slightly obscure because it tries to be smart about not recomputing an index expression. Now to explain the algorithm, we don't need optimized code (and an optimizing compiler, which we'd use if efficiency is of any concern, would spot this anyway, so there isn't any reason to even slightly complicate the code even in production).

The code from the ACM Sian article by Chan is much clearer; here's transcribed and commented pseudocode:

def z_order(p, q, d):
    """"Returns true if p < q according to Z-order in d dimensions.
    p and q are supposed to be arrays of d coordinates.""""
    i = 0 # index of most significant dimension
    for j in range(1, d):
        # Use ^ (exclusive or) to eliminate equal bits.
        # msb_is_less will see ones where the coordinates differ.
        if msb_is_less (p[i]^q[i], p[j]^q[j]):
            i = j
    return p[i] < q[i]

def msb_is_less(l, r):
    """"Returns true if the Most Significant Bit of l is less than that of r.""""
    return l <= r or l < l^r # Described as """"neat trick"""" by Chan

Note that the algorithm in the article has """"l < r"""" instead of """"l <= r""""; this changes the result of msb_is_less but I suspect it does not change the result of z_order.

Response much appreciated, thanks. Well, I'm trying to retain as much of your text as possible. There's a lot of good stuff in there which simply needs sourcing and updating in with the other material. That's why I abandoned the sandbox idea and thought it best to just run with what we have. The article is going to get massive in the next few weeks though to make it comprehensive as possible, but it'll be split and condensed later. I really do need your help if possible though on tracing the source of the unsourced material. I'll try to do what I can but I'll approach you if I can't find a source for something.♦  """,0
"I think shortening the American Civil War article would make it worse 
The subject matter makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the article to be adequate in covering the major topics if it was shorter, due to the nature of the subject matter.

Hi. ) I got a bit distracted there; I wanted to see if I could find his books. He's allowed to upload a self-portrait (sometimes people claim studio pictures are self-portraits, but I bet this one really is), but """"used with permission"""" is not going to cut it from a licensing standpoint. ) My guess would be that he's trying to address the licensing requirements set out at his talk page but doesn't understand them.

 Phase TWO Consensus Buidling 
I would say that it is notable that Long gave a speech and that speech was covered national for the first time (likely). Under WIKI rules that sentace meets guidelines, it is NPOV and it is verfiable. I contend it cannot be deleted by a warring editor on his own whim.

Now, I say let's discuss whether it SHOULD be in the article. I think it can be, without question. I don't think it wise to hold this article to so much scrutinty that no one can edit it without challenge. That would be totally wrong. SO, I suggest we move on from notability to real consensus building as to whether it should be in. For a lack of a better term, let's just call it """"Notable-enough"""". Is it notable enough to be in there, under wiki rules. I have said that it is not the most important thing around. It is not. I understand that others think it may not be. But I don't think the case has been made that it is not notable, but that good points have been made as to whether is is """"notable enough""""

"""::::You're assuming far more about my views than I've actually said. I have two related points. First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

 To conclude, whilst there legitimate arguments for doing so, we don't have to """"wade into the mud"""" of self-identity, and basic encylopaedic principles demand that.

 Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:

First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , """"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university"""", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a """"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System"""".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that """"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University"""" and that """"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature"""" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.

The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).

Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.

Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  """,0

North Africa is a vast region, a large region that spans a huge geographical locale, much greater than that of Western Europe. Enmeshing all these different groups of people together for the sake of simplicity on your part I suppose is unfair, unethical and false. Much of the information that is posted regarding their origins is false and based on a study conducted in Southern Morocco, near the border of Mauritania. As the studies were conducted by europeans, who often look for the exotic element, we cannot even be sure that these were inhabitants of the region and not maurauders. Basing the findings of this study to for instance the Kabyle people who do not think of themselves as Berber as they are racially apart, culturally as well and even geographically reside mainly in mountainous regions in algeria is absurd and grave. As a native of the region, I am saddened by the distortion of so many peoples on wikipedia, a source that is edited by anyone, people such as the madman who thinks that only """"blacks"""" exist in Africa, which is as the world knows false and an absurd proposition.

 My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse 

I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.

I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:

The admin User:Deacon of Pndapetzim must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.

I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.

Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' """"solution"""".

Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island. Silly non-policy arguments about where to put historical 'Ireland's aside, there has always been an Irish nation (covering all or most",0

 A Floppy Version? 

I deleted the lines in the article which referred to The Dig being released on floppy.  While my recollections of 12+ year old games may be slightly rusty, I am virtually certain that The Dig was only released on CD-ROM.  Given the amount of work (and money) put into the voice acting and pre-rendered cinemas, it would have been insanity to try to make a floppy version. (which would have required even MORE work coming up with static screens to cover the missing movies)

There was a 30-meg or so demo released around 1994 which could have, with compression, probably fit on 12 floppies.  That's likely what the editor was thinking of.  If someone can come up with concrete information on the demo's release, it would be a good addition into the """"release"""" section.

"There are many inaccurate statements being posted here. Far too many, i don't have time to correct all of them. The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact.

 Semi-protected edit request on 24 November 2014 

The article currently states:
There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of any disease.

There are a few issues with this statement that make it unsuitable:
 An absolute negative is, of course, impossible to prove, and quite a high hurdle to even support reasonably well.
 There are countless examples, including some mentioned in both the cited article and this Wikipedia article, of ways that Ayurvedic treatments have been effective at treating an assortment of diseases.  The cited article includes 5 examples.  (Many statements about the efficacy of Ayurveda concentrate on major disorders.  But, eczema, as one minor example, is a disease which is readily treated by Ayurveda.  So, it may be appropriate to state that there is a lack of evidence showing its efficacy for treating """"certain diseases"""", there is no way to support the claim that there is no scientific evidence as to its effectiveness in treating """"any disease"""".)
 If there were strong evidence supporting the likelihood that """"no scientific evidence"""" existed, then it may be a suitable statement.  But, such an strong statement requires strong support.  The only supporting evidence is one article which is not an academically rigorous source, and which, itself, offers 5 examples of scientific evidence supporting that certain Ayurvedic medicine is effective at treating certain disorders.
 The statement that """"there is no scientific evidence [...]"""" is a claim, and not a supported fact.  For this claim to stand, it should be better supported.  Or, it might better be reworded.

I propose that the above claim be replaced by:
Though some studies suggest the efficacy of some Ayurvedic treatment for certain conditions, the science is inclusive as to the efficacy of Ayurveda as a complete system of treatment.

This statement is supportable and non-controversial.

I may come up with a list of disorders with supporting evidence as to Ayurvedic efficacy to broaden the claim that Ayurvedic treatments have been shown to be effective at treating certain conditions.  However, in the interim, I think there is sufficient cause to remove the claim that there is absolutely none unless such a statement could be at least strongly supported.

It's unfortunate that the history of Sicily here at Wiki is the sole province of this one individual, """"Racial Reality,"""" who is well-known amongst forum posters as being very biased against any research that shows admixture.  He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.

Blood group studies from the 1970's are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  

An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. 

In general, you can measure the end-result of a person's genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. 

The Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by """"significant"""" is """"statistically significant"""", not that a large portion of Sicilians' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.

The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found """"African"""" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.

The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not """"problematic,"""" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and """"indels"""" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't """"refute"""" or """"overrule"""" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study """"outdated"""" or """"overruled"""" or """"refuted""""  all absolute drivel!

Lastly, the person who wrote this...

""""Lastly, talk of races is all hogwash in any event...""""

...should be aware that the person made the steward of all things Sicilian, the above-mentioned Racial Reality, is a proponent of the existence of races...just look at his handle.

I am a retired geneticist, and I do believe I have something valuable to contribute.  Incidentally, I am of partial Sicilian ancestry, and am proud of all who contributed to that great island's melting-pot population.  I hope at least some of what I've said will be taken to he",0

Thanks Director. @IP90. People constantly changing sourced text in articles because they have a view about ethnicity is very annoying, and the words are not ill-chosen they reflect the everyday facts of WP article on Balkans subjects. Every week I (and dozens of other editors) probably revert a dozen editors who have a particular view about what language code should be used in some article or another, and it's just POV nonsense. Your initial edit was just another example of carte blanche changes made without reference to the sourced material in the article. Now you have looked at it, you obviously have realised that the sources use Bosnian Muslims, not Bosniaks. This is the case with almost all scholarly texts on WW2 Yugoslavia. You can insist on whatever you like, but I certainly have no issue with identifying the commonly used modern ethnic affiliation of """"Bosniaks"""" in the lead, just as I have no issue with identifying what the modern states are called.

 No association between """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""" and """"Bell Labs""""? 

Earlier on this page,  had enquired:

Name origin
Wasn't the parent company (and hence weren't the labs) named after Alexander Graham Bell?  No mention of him can I find here. Carrionluggage 

Today User:BilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled """"Early namesake"""" in its entirety, which chronicled the """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""", also known as the Volta Laboratory (which A.G. Bell created after he won the Volta Prize). The deleted section was titled 'Early namesake' for the reason that there was an association by name as follows:
 1876 –A.G. Bell receives master phone patent, becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed American Bell Telephone Company;
 1880 –A.G. Bell creates the Volta Laboratory, a.k.a. the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, for research into sound recording and transmission, including the photophone; also
 1880 –""""the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T; Long Lines."""" A.G. Bell still owns shares in ABTC, and hence thus is part owner of AT&T;  he remains """"Chief Electrician"""" of ABTC and its children for several years;
 1881 –Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric;
 1885  –The long lines project """"was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)"""";
 1899  –""""the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell""""  (that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child);
 1925 –Bell Labs is created, and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of AT&T;'s engineering department.

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or AT&T; Engineering, and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot, since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection. That there was a connection by name and share ownership, as shown above, is obvious; therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article.  Comments?    """,0

Dear Mark,

There came a point where I believed that certain non-BSF people  were going to whittle down and mischaracterize the BSF position and could not be reasoned with.  It comes from watching atheist/Christian boards where atheist of the militant atheist variety cannot be reasoned with and are quite hostile.  

At that point, I mocked and taunted certain non-BSF people for censorship (which they were engaging in) and mocked sources/links like Farrell Till that the non-BSF side was offering.   I do realize that I was very probably breaking Wikipedia rules there.  I also recognize that asking Duncharris to prove he was sincere by actions and rebuffing what I thought was a faux friendship letter was somewhat premature.  I should have made greater attempts to see if it was sincere.  

I will tell you what I will do.  I will send duncharris and MickWest a peace offering letter.  If it works then fine.  If not, nothing lost.

@Shmayo I already know the map from John Speed, but this far away from being an evidence that the Suryoye/Suraye called themselves Assyrians or considered the ancient Assyrians as their ancestors. The """"Deutschen"""" don't call themselves Germans (Germanen) or Alemanes (Alemannen) in their native tongue and it's not the first time that the word Suryoye/Suraye was mistranslated into """"Assyrian"""" by outsiders:missionaries and colonists. Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words, which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity? The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also """"Siryon"""" or """"Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)"""", which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites.

This was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

 Fred Meyer: Reversion 

I was asked to explain my reversion of your addition to the Fred Meyer article. That addition was composed of four parts. 
First, you claimed Fred G. Meyer to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order etc., providing sources. I won't discuss the validity of the sources here, but that clearly concerns Fred G. Meyer himself, not the stores, unless you can provide a source that states his business was influenced by his philosophical leanings. 
Next, you elaborated on the rosicrucian connection to Hitler. As far as I can see, the main connection to Fred Meyer was that both Nazism and the stores use the colours red, white and black, which is a rather weak link. No source was provided that the store logo may have been influenced by its Founder's rosicrucian connections. Hitler's connection to the rosicrucians was sourced (again I won't discuss the quality of the sources), but was unrelated to the stores. 
Thirdly, you claimed that the layout of racks gives a swastika and that green freight carts are nicknamed """"U-Boats"""", but this, the part most relevant for the stores, was still unsourced. 
Finally, the """"Notes"""" part could have been more fitting for the talk page, but definitely does not belong into the article proper.
Thus, your additions were either unrelated to the stores or unsourced.

"$RiCH$
    To understand where Rich is right now is just half the equation, the other half lies in his history. Much of Rich's music tells the story of that history. Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.
 
   Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences’ attention. They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.
 
   In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry. Since its inception, Rich has gravitated towards some daunting, precarious projects highlighting the true and reliable nature of the company.
 
   In a time of everyone just being out there for themselves competition; HardHead Records remains committed to sponsoring and promoting local up in coming artists that are committed to something more than that. Artists of the DMV(Dc, Maryland & Virginia) that share a desire for unity amongst other artists. Rich has a vision of his trademark being something above and beyond the rest!
 
   Rich is currently working to create a movement in the DMV, a dynasty of sorts… evolving from the very best of the best. HardHead Records takes pride in preserving Rich's initial vision, which resonates his own virtues and beliefs. Rich strongly believes that in working together, in being unified and remaining true to himself and all those that choose to join the movement that unity will prevail. This prevalence of unity will in fact produce victory for all those that have wisely chosen to be involved.",0

7. I think the version where it has previews came out May 1986, the version with no previews and FBI warnings fading came out October 1986 because it was still in progression of editing, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out December 1986 because DSAS: vol.2 came out that day, meaning that version with the red FBI warnings and the VDA came out January 1987.

 'I COME FROM A MUSLIM FAMILY FROM BOSNIA, BUT BY ETHNICITY I AM A SERB. I BELONG TO SERBIAN LITERATURE' - Mehmed """"Mesa"""" Selimovic 

This is a response to VolunteerMarek's """"here we go again"""" post. Mehmed declared himself to be a Serb, a writer of the Serbian language, and a member of Serbian literature specifically because he knew that people would try to play him off as a member of the invented ethnicities (Bosniak, Muslim by nationality, Montenegrin, Bosnian) that Tito was pushing for to further break apart and split up the Serbs. Mehmed wrote in Serbian, and he explicitly stated so! Here is a letter he wrote to the SERBIAN academy of Sciences and Arts that he recorded in his book """"Sećanja"""":  """"Potičem iz muslimanske porodice iz Bosne, a po nacionalnoj pripadnosti sam Srbin. Pripadam srpskoj literaturi"""" -> TRANSLATION: I COME FROM A MUSLIM FAMILY FROM BOSNIA, BUT BY ETHNICITY I AM A SERB. I BELONG TO SERBIAN LITERATURE 

Selimovic was a Serb writer who was born into a Muslim family in Bosnia, and, like most Muslim intellectuals and writers living in Bosnia at the time (other examples beside Mehmed: Hasan Kikic, Skender Kulenovic, Camil Sijadic, etc.), realized that all """"Muslims by nationality"""" are Serbs who were forced to convert to Islam by Turkish occupiers who stole their sons through a process known as Devshirme and impaled resistors to Islam. To write him off as anything other than a Serbian writer of Serbian literature in the Serbian language of Serb blood would be incredibly ignorant, and done (most likely) by people with an Anti-Serb agenda. 

Selimovic's Serb Ethnicity was a key point mentioned in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic in the International Court of Justice in the Hague.

Volunteer Marek, I don't give a shit about your notice, posting a notice does not allow you to rewrite history. Also his ethnicity and language he writes in is very important because he is a writer and his works deal with ethnic questions in the Balkans.""",0

Making unwarranted accusations of bad faith (as opposed to explanations of good faith) can be inflammatory, and is often unhelpful in a dispute.

The problem with linking up Basaev's claim with VK going to the training camp is that the two sources claim he was already at the camp long before the burial.

Сейчас мы установили, что тогда он вместе с еще 30 боевиками прошел обучение на одной из баз террористов под названием «Талибан». Она располагалась неподалеку от села Галашки (At the end of 2002 he just landed somewhere - a Russian phrase meaning  we lost track of him - now we have established, said our interlocutor, that at that time together with 30 fighters he went trough training at one of the terrorist bases, called """"Taliban"""". It was situated not far from the village of Galashki) It seems he was allowed out for the burial, but in company (see below).

I also found the Trud article which claims a temporary separation, or even state of divorce of the parents: []

There is more interesting info in this article:
1) Aleksandra was married before: Анатолий усыновил трехлетнего ребенка Александры от первого брака Владимира. 
2) At School Number One Vladimir was horribly ambitious and looked dosn on the other kids of his age: Там у Владимира проявились болезненная амбициозность и презрительное отношение к ровесникам.
(other sources claim Boris was a hooligan: so he differed from the kids his age in the opposite way)
3) No info on the father after their return, but since other sources claim among other things that Anatoly often visited his son in jail and was convinced he was innocent, I think they again lived together.
4) Vladimir did not arrive at the funeral on his own, but in the company of two bearded friends, one of whom villagers later recognized amongh the dead Beslan hostage takers: Да не один, а в компании двух никому не знакомых бородачей - одного из них потом эльхотовцы опознали среди убитых в Беслане террористов.
5) After the Islamic funeral, VK went back to the village and pushed the tables with drinks around, referring to Islamic law, and threatened to shoot the people gathered there: Вернувшись в село, где начинались поминки, Ходов попытался перевернуть столы с выпивкой, ссылаясь на законы фундаментального ислама. И даже пригрозил расстрелять собравшихся.
6) The journalist asked the Militia minister of Northern Ossetia whether the freeing of VK proved that he had powerful protectors in  the local police department (ROVD). """"I do not exclude that possibility"""". Я не исключаю такой возможности”, - ответил мне Сослан Иванович.
7) Aleksandra already left Elkhotovo before the village council decide to banish her. According to rumours she went to live with someone she knew in Vladikavkaz: Ну а мать террористов еще до решения сельского схода уехала из Эльхотова. По слухам она перебралась к знакомым во Владикавказ. (Vladikavkaz is the capital of North Ossetia. I doubt very much that a village council has the right to banish someone from North Ossetia.)

I don't like to get into a revert war though I am pretty sure that my edits are quite justified and I will be the one who will eventually win the debate.

You continue with the angle that you are capabable of NPOV. No one is is capable of NPOV regarding a Political isssue here in the US at this time but least of all you. One has only to read your contributions to see that you clearly have no interest in neutrality. I have admited my POV from day one while everyone conservative has to have the rock they hide under lifted. (see Ai.Kefu)

The game at hand here now is how much truth can be added by the liberal P'sOV before it is sanitized and censored by the conservative side. There should be no pretense of neutrality here or on any other political site just a much more modest goal of contributors finding some semblance of """"balance"""" between the two distinct P'sOV in the overall article. There is no way the article can remain """"Fluffy"""" with no mention of her deeds and or disdain from the entire black community and the other communities of whom civil rights are trampled on. I just wish the large negative View about a Condi would stop being sanitized summarily. 

If you cannot admit that neutrality is impossible from you or any other conservative or liberal contributor then the conversation we are pretending to have can come to a quick cessation and we can just agree to disagree so we can resume with the rapid fire edit/revert/bashing/revert/censorship... activity that will lead to the ultimate freezing of the article """,0

By your last sentence, (20:59 30 April) it would seem that we are, perhaps, getting a little closer to nub of our discussion. The article is about his work. The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group.

The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information.

As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance.  The Collection was started as the Fawcett Library.  Biographical details of Millicent Fawcett are not central to the theme of the article, an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is.   15:00, 1 May",0

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah’s witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn’t even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it’s in a pro-JW website, “strictly genteel”, which transcribed the noted WT book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?”, and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I’m still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That’s what’s stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And “The World History of the Jewish People”.   At least that’s he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill’s book says this:   

“When we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh’s army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening’s entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differences—literary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to material—between Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place “once upon a time”—in other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happening—it is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of time—beyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity—a concreteness of detail, a concern to get things right—that convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.”

GA Sweeps Review: On Hold
As part of the WikiProject Good Articles, we're doing sweeps to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the GA criteria. I'm specifically going over all of the """"World History-Americas"""" articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a Good article. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed. I have made multiple corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and if progress is being made then the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Here are the points that need to be addressed:

"Bangladesh Law Minister's criticisms regarding Drishtipat

The reason we have cited the report regarding the Bangladeshi Law Ministers comments about Drishtipat's partiality toward the Awami League is because Drishtipat themselves [] put the Law Ministers comments and their response together under the heading ' Drishtipat response to the law minister's allegation' on their site. If the organisation itself felt criticised and responded, then it is hardly controversial to presume that it was Drishtipat that the Law Minister was talking about. I'm sure Drishtipat knew their own position and intentions better than the moderator (Ragib) on Wikipedia!

Besides in Bangali politikospeak, the governing party of the day rarely criticises an opponent by name. For example, when the BNP were in power, they would use oblique language like 'a certain party is causing violence in Bangladesh' with reference to hartals. Everyone would read between the lines and know that they are criticising their main opponents the Awami League. It's hardly rocket science. 

It is therefore reasonable as a citation of the governments position and the Law Minister also expanded on the reasons eg. partisan reporting re: government achievements.",0

Nitack. No, I am not confused at all, actually. As I've explained earlier, the natrual coal synthesis process is a distraction from the idea of NPOV of this article and we can discuss all that later.  And, that has nothing to do with my personal views or opinions.  As mentioned, abiotic oil is rapidly becoming the accepted theory and abiotic coal processes have more recently been discussed and been put forth as theory. That is not the major part of contention in this article, however, and can be adressed at some future time (after the POV is restored to neutral tone). And please, don't be condecending.  I've obviously read the Wikipedia policies and we all know 'exactly' what YOU are doing with this biased article against clean coal technology. By the way, there you go again with the phrase 'any reputable source' - in your view, any source that disagrees with your highly biased view must be 'non-reputable.' Again, you say 'even the coal industry' ... 'their product' ... etc. Just look at the way you talk, it's amazing. The fact is, many people, including those in the 'coal industry' (as you put it) believe that there are certain disadvantages to using coal in the way it is generally used today. But the hazards that you're concentrating on with coal, namely so-called anthopogenic climate change and global warming (and related junk science) are not the principle hazards.  Many of the reasons why certain aspects of the combustion are even being discussed (like the idea of CO2 capture) are not because of good science and/or true hazards, but rather scientific ignorance and very bad, very totalitarian policy.  23:03",0

I share Húsönd's rational for opposing the move (despite the University of Prishtina precedent, where I just don't dare to tread -)
As discussed in Talk:Priština, I find that """"Pristina"""" is just a simplified version of """"Priština"""", widely used because of mainly two factors: lack of """"š"""" in English (and most keyboards) and political neutrality. In fact, the very same people who write """"Pristina"""" pronounce the word with the """"š/sh"""" sound. In my personal opinion, and in Húsönd's words, [diacritics are] a more perfectionist and educative way to display [the name].
As for the official website, check the """"Welcome to Kosova"""" section, not to mention the """"History"""" section -)
1965: Prishtina Airport was officially opened and initially was opened for domestic flights only.
2000: Airport Prishtina initially has begun its operations and other airport matters with 45 employed workers in total.
I can't stress enough that my opinion has nothing to do with taking sides in the current Kosovo conflict (which I would solve by moving the entire population of the Western Balkans to Antarctica, and giving the region to the penguins - who probably will change Priština's official name to something in the lines of Tekeli-li).

 revision to chart 

I know it can be written that he was safe every week but go around to all the AI contenstant charts and you see the result of every week in the chart.   
Yea and they all should be changed. Just as we don't beat the obvious into people we don't need to state ___ has again gone another week. The info of what order they sang is also unhelpful. The lede clearly states he finished as the runner-up and we can give credit to our readers that they will realize that he didn't just sing those songs as a special guest. I'm not going to delete on all those other AI articles but I believe that should happen.   Banjeboi 
 So you think if someone wants to know if a contestant was safe they can go the American Idol season page?   
The chart is a supplement to the text which should be clear. The lede should state as of April 2009 ____ is a contestant. And when eliminated it states that info. Likewise with bottom three info, if it's relevant it will be in a reliable source - and OMG every bit of this stuff is covered - so we then cover it. _____ has never been in the bottom three or ____ has been in the bootom three twice before elimiation, etc. The order they sang? That seems likes it's original research or, sorry to say, fancruft, but not helpful on the biography articles. We have no reliable sourcing that the order impacts anything although it might. It ends up being as trivial as what they wore, their hair, who the friends were in the audience etc. If any of it is covered in reliable sources then maybe. Meanwhile the season article does a fairly good job of organizing the rest. Last year i took this article on and I guarantee it's been a non-stop effort to keep it cleaned up.

 Your edits to Washington, D.C. 

Hi. Thank you for the good faith improvements made to Washington, D.C.. However, the changes have been mostly reverted for the following reasons:
All new information must have sources that correspond with WP:CITE.
Per WP:SUMMARY, the main article on Washington, D.C. provides only a summary of information and does not go into very many specifics, unless it is considered to be a """"major"""" aspect of the city. Since hurricanes and noreasters are rare, they are only mentioned in passing. In our efforts to maintain Washington D.C.'s Featured Article status, the editors typically revert edits that would expand the information beyond what is required by WP:SUMMARY. Along these lines, storms that have hit D.C. are not mentioned because A) there is already a subpage on the subject (List of Maryland and Washington, D.C. hurricanes (1980–present)) and B) since we can't mention every storm, we mention none of them. It is also the reason """"noreasters"""" aren't defined in detail, because there is already an article devoted to them, which users can read to find more information.
The article is on Washington, D.C. itself, not the surrounding area. Therefore, any information about what happens in the suburbs or the nearby coastal areas is not included in this article.
If you have any sources with information that you believe is absolutely necessary for understanding D.C.'s climate, please make it known. Best,   """,0

Just to correct you, in america, hispanic and anglo are used as racial terms. Where do you come from that you don't recognize this? Again, just fo the record, europeans view non-white south americans as hispanic. Spaniards are not considered hispanic by european standards. 

And don't let these stupid americans fool you either! At one point, they considered jews and irish to be non-white, believe it or not. So, this speaks volumes of the ignorance of americans who don't even come close to europeans in culture, arts, language, science, fashion, etc.

""":Chalk one up for Ed!  Robert Merkel

Perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from Terrorism against Arabs back here, if we came to having 2 distinct articles once again? For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism Uriyan

 Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)

With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons:
 It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing
 It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen.
 Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.  Uriyan

The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.

 The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism. Uriyan

 Uriyan

This sentence has been removed from the article about Kach. """"They have also organized murders and beatings of Palestinians in the U.S.""""
 Really?  Who?  

I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of """"Israeli terrorism"""". All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.). 

Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as """"Israeli terrorism"""" instead of """"Jewish terrorism""""?  ~~

I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so """"controversial"""" coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of """"terrorist"""" vs. """"freedom fighter"""", maybe we should just have """"Violence against Israelis"""" and """"Violence against Palestinians"""" pages, or some such?

 Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than """"Israeli terrorism"""". 

Then maybe this should redirect to """"Violence against Palestinians"""" (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?

The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving """"X terrorism"""" pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism. 

Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the """"violence"""" ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the """"terrorism"""" pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are """"terrorism"""" and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave """"terrorism or not?"""" decisions up to the readers.

 Having considered the concept, I support it. In the text itself, we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom.

I'm going to be blunt about this, because there's a lot of things that don't add up here, and I'm a bit annoyed at the whole matter, to be quite honest.  Seven SPA editors for a guy with no press in English?  I don't think so.  First of all, as a technical printer and a PhD, you should know what a return key is, or at least be able to research it.  Use it.  Secondly, you do not verify what is reliable or not as far as sources go, and """"what you are personally aware of"""" is largely irrelevant.  There are policies here.  Read them.  Frankly, we haven't even satisfactorily answered the question of why Oprea is notable in English?  Because he lives in Boston?  So do a lot of other non-notable people.  Oprea has no hits on Google in English aside from this article and his own personal pages as the top three.  He's had no coverage in English-language sources.  As a matter of fact, he's made it obvious that he's the only reviewer of his own books on a lot of websites.  The stuff you're coming up with in Romanian is Internet material, not Romanian literary journals.  Even his Romanian article is lousy.  Are you trying to write a legitimate article on a writer, or an advertising piece for your buddy?  Wikipedia is not his free literary agent.   02:31, 27""",0

 Attention Admin 02 - Ongoing WP:GAMING and Tendentious editing by user   

Again this relates to WP:GAME and appears to need referral to ANI due to ongoing warnings over Dalit and related subjects references. 

The edits made under meisleading edit summary remove Multiple and Different references and not just one as indicated falsely. The content of the page Rape culture page is significant.  

The edits by  (Diff)have removed the following:

In 1999, Palagummi Sainath writing in The Hindu newspaper """"A dalit goes to court"""" revealed how dalit women were told they had to pay to both enter a police station and to file a report of rape. Police were challenged over this issue by Amnesty International, but whilst claiming the issue was being addressed legally were unable to explain any mechanism or records that showed any such action. 

The edits have been made under the guise of removing the following Source Diff:

Rape Culture  Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology (2007)Rape culture is a concept of unknown origin and of uncertain definition; yet it has made its way into everyday vocabulary and is assumed to be commonly understood. The award-winning documentary film Rape Culture made by Margaret Lazarus in 1975 takes credit for first defining the concept."""" - doi: 10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x

Echoing the statement above, with some more elucidation: there is no objective criteria under which the Telegraph is a more objective (or """"reputable"""") source than Counterpunch. The Telegraph was a part of the Hollinger International chain of newspapers, whose board of directors happened to include one Richard Perle  a known American conservative and supporter of the Israeli right-wing. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs is likewise a think tank and reliquary for Israeli right-wingers (retired military and diplomatic staff especially) and funded by convicted felon Michael Milken. It is not hard to see that a right-wing ideologue Weiner did a hit-piece on Edward Said using funds from a right-wing think tank, published it in a right wing journal (Commentary), that was picked up by a sympathetic newspaper (the Daily Telegraph).

Presenting either the Jerusalem Center or the Telegraph as """"objective"""" is an obvious distortion, that only owes itself to the right-wing media having warped the meaning of """"objective"""" and """"fair and balanced"""". The attack pieces on Edward Said have to be treated as just that - attack pieces, not scholarship. If we run them here, Said's supporters get a free shot to refute them as well.  """,0

Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article. Nor am I the only one who thinks this. Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.   

I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.

"Correction to Karljoos 
Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture.

18-ethoxycoronaridine
Hi Edgar. Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I'm thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   
The compound doesn't show up in SciFinder, but it's not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It's quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn't come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) 
Hmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I'm still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I'd be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   
Ok the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn't one of the examples or preferred compounds",0

I dunno. For now I'd suggest just treating it as normal anon IP vandalism and just revert it as needed.

"From Goldenberg (Arch Intern Med, 1999)  

CONCLUSIONS 

Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome... Medicines that affect pain perception, sleep, and mood have been useful and should be integrated with activity, exercise, and educational programs. Most patients with FM observed in tertiary referral centers report little change in their symptoms over time. The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ...

POV language in text about Anthology 1 album cover

1) The cited reference in the current version is just the DVD cover which is a visual image not an independent source about the matter

2) The entire collage on all 3 album covers is full of images that have been torn and overlaid by other images. Not one single image on the 3 covers is in its entirety. 

2) The word """"ripped"""" in the current version of the text is pejorative and implies that there was a motive to be defamatory to Best. That may or may not be the case.   As individuals we can SPECULATE as to whether the removal of Best's head was ill-motivated or simply an artist's way to graphically convey what happened to Best (ie replaced by Starr) - but we can't do that on Wikipedia. We can only present incontrovertible facts.

They are these:

A) All three Anthology album artworks created by Klaus Voormann are in collage style with photographs and visual elements torn and only shown in part. 

B) The part of the Savage Young Beatles record jacket in the centre of the Anthology 1 artwork that is torn is at the corner where Pete Best's face had been.

C)  Where Best's face was on the poster is the face of his successor, Ringo Starr, on the Please Please Me album cover beneath it in the collage. 

D)  Best is seen on the Anthology cover in a separate small photograph standing in front of Aspinall's van parked outside The Cavern. 

E) The cover of Best's album Haymans Green displays the image of Best's face not seen because of the torn album cover seen on the Anthology 1 cover.

 Sexual Abuse Section - Swiss Rejection of Extradition Request. 

The current information in the sexual abuse section give great detail on portions of what the Swiss said was there basis for the denial of the US request.  
However it is not at all balanced by the US perspective.  This makes it appear not NPOV in my view.  Problems include.
1.  There is a dispute of whether the documents were requested or not.
2.  It a large change from standard extradition requests, the Swiss evaluated the merits of the case, and the punishment used.  They speculated that the 42 days of evaluation could have been the entire sentence.   That speculation is defense argument for matters that have not been determined in the courts.  In this way the Swiss became a judge of the case, to which the US was not allowed to argue against.  This deviation from standard means of handling extradition requests is already being speculated to have a lasting impact on other cases.

Here are some of the concerns on the other side of what is currently written:

The Swiss government said its decision to reject extradition was partly based on U.S. authorities' failure to turn over transcripts of secret testimony given by the attorney who originally handled the director's case. The testimony """"should prove"""" that Polanski already served his sentence with the court-ordered diagnostic study, the Swiss Justice Ministry said.  

The main issue appeared to be how the Swiss government expanded its focus beyond the formalities of the American extradition request to pass judgment on allegations of misconduct by Los Angeles authorities.

""""This was an admission that when higher interests are at stake, not everyone is equal before the law,"""" wrote the widely respected Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper. """"Some are a bit more equal.""""

Another Zurich paper, the Tages-Anzeiger, called the Swiss decision """"shaky.""""

""""It breaks with the tradition of only examining the formal correctness of extradition requests,"""" it said. """"Perhaps the new practice will in the future also benefit detainees who have less of a lobby than the world-famous director.""""
http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwv8qKQSMIhfdh2oT7hD0TeXDMpgD9GUC3O80

ALL of this does not explain why Polanski skipped out of his sentencing hearing, if he believed he had served his sentence, and when he quite capable lawyers representing him before the judge.

So I see the rational used by the Swiss to be controverted and biased to the defense agreements, which have never been tested before a court of law.  To where these arguments were argued, the Judges refused to grant their merit.  The method the Swiss used to determine the extradition request is entirely new.  So I believe these sentences in the section either need balancing of the two sides, and or pared down.

 RFC 

I didn't say the sockpuppet issue wasn't relevant, I said it couldn't be proven and if he insists he's not JB it should be dropped.  The stuff with JB happened around the time I started on Wikipedia and I saw a little bit of it and have to agree that they have similar editing styles.  However, if we can't prove that Booyaka is JB, then we have to judge Booyaka's behavior on its own merits.  If, on the other hand, we can prove that Booyaka is JB, then Booyaka can be blocked.  

As for """"However when Booyaka replaced the tags and ignored the notes on the edit summary - that's when it became vandalism.""""  No, it's still a content dispute.  It's an inappropriate action, but not vandalism.  Read WP:Vandalism, especially the part about what vandalism is not.  I would call replacing the tags """"Bullying or Stubbornness"""".  Not right, not good, but not vandalism either.  Accusing someone of vandalism when they aren't vandalising takes a bad situation and makes it worse.

"Forthcoming Changes, Outline 

The group of students at the University of British Columbia editing this wikipedia entry have tentatively decided on the following as an outline for the entry:

 History 

The purpose of this introductory section is to give the readers an insight and understanding of the background history of Hells Gate and its indigenous inhabitants. The First Nations people used Hells Gate as a prime salmon fishing ground, and because of this, it became one of many locations for a popular fish station. I also discuss the environmental reasoning (deglaciation) behind the presence of salmon, and subsequently indigenous people in the Fraser Canyon and Hells Gate area.   
 Hells Gate Slide 
This section will focus on the Hells Gate Slide itself, beginning with the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway which spurred the slide. It will discuss how human impact and the slide changed the water ecology and what measures were initially taken in order to solve the issue.   
 Environmental Impacts 

The main focus of this section would be damage to the local environment due to the slide. It would address the impact the Hells Gate slide had on the fish habitat, particularly focusing on the sockeye salmon runs disruption. It would then explore the decline in the salmon population due to the incident and would focus on the relocation of the salmon, which was unable to reach the spawning grounds, into other rivers.
  

 Social and Political Impacts 
In this section we will look at the social impacts on the native fisheries and on the commercial fisheries that happened as a result of the hells gate slide.

 The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC 
Here I'll discuss how the Commission came to be, what it was comprised of, who was in it, how it functioned, etc. also their research (although this may go in the next section). This section may be relatively small, as there is already an existing entry on the Commission.

 International Dispute 
Discuss the disputed research methods and conclusions, and the escalating conflict
 Government Response 
This section will deal with the response to the slide - building of fishways, etc.

Are you serious? If I did simply buzz off every time someone like you told me to 'use my main account', you'd have never found out about the sock Werieth at all, because I sure as hell would NEVER expose any account I had with a good reputation to the likes of Future in the context of accusing one of his mates of being a sock. That's just not someone with any sense does. If you persist in removing my posts, you'll also never see any action taken against the other admins who enabled his illegitimate return to be much longer than it needed to be, and you'll never see anyone ask those """"lazy"""" checkusers just why they helped, when their primary role is supposedly to be detecting socks just like Werieth. The only reason the Wikipediocracy link you found exists is precisely because of those admins/checkusers, and people like you, who thought they were helping Wikipedia by telling me to """"buzz off"""". So thank you kindly for your advice, but with all due respect, I'll continue help Wikipedia the way I see fit, and I'll not be stopped in that endeavour by anyone.   """,0
"About the only statement in the above that I whole-heartedly agree with is that there are many other articles on Wikipedia about contemporary artists that are just as biased, if not more so, than Catman Cohen.  Also, the fact that he is anonymous is not at all the basis of my concern about the article.  I don't see why we can't have an article that describes who this artist is and what he is done without veering into an endorsement of him. (talk)",0
"""Race & genetics==
Addressing Crusio's comment, there are markers that could be looked for. for example is the PCSK9 allele, this is all in the context that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases. Certain races also respond differently to medications. Certain allels are prevalent in only certain races (although there is race mixing as immigration and such, the alleles are still passed on)

I'm sure you all know I'm alluding to NitroMed's BiDil.

In this case, BiDil seems to help heart failure in african americans more then other races. Should we not research into this? 

Would it be racist to give african americans (in the article, they were """"self identified black patients"""") this medicine?

I think a lot of the stigma around nazi's and eugenics and racism has halted the academic freedom into research into this matter. People needs to understand that as an academic, one must have an academic view on things. If a particular drug helps a particular race, then why not use it? But we can't CHOOSE what results produces, we must accept them in order to change. ie. If a particular gene/allele is present in one race that's lacking in others, I must ACKNOWLEDGE the difference in order to help develop methods to create possible genetic cures.

To turn a blind eye to this is not only limiting academic freedom, but is an injustice to humanity as a whole. An example is seen in the case of Lysenkoism, which caused famines that killed millions.

"IP Extender question 

Just FYI, I've managed to solve my problem, and the same (or similar) solution may work for you.  My extender had an IP on the wrong subnet (192.168.0.123, when all my other devices were on the 192.168.1.* subnet), so I regained access by factory resetting and changing the static IP to 192.168.1.123.  Since you can't get on even after a factory reset, you could try modifyin your router DHCP settings so that the subnet it's assigning everything to includes the static IP you assigned for the extender (and if that still doesn't work, the factory default).  Assuming the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then this just means the first 3 sections of the IP need to be the same.",0

 EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you.

I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.

I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:

(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. """") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """""""") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """""""")

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

Here's the regex
(date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$

I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.

 Thermological explanation of galling 
Hi. I´m responsible for most of the text regarding the galling phenomenon presently found in the Wiki archive. 

My opinion of the galling phenomenon is the following. Galling is highly connected to thermal or pressurized influenced contact and the interaction between the mating surfaces. The temperature or pressure around penetrating objects is higher for small and sharp objects compared to larger blunt objects due to higher acceleration. This means that phase transition can take place even in the initial build up process and onset of adhesive material transfer and galling. It was clear that a change in material behaviour, which increased resistance for further advancement, took place around sharp edges even in the build up process where attached material was insignificant. My conclusion, there is a connection between the attached material and the geometrical situation around penetrating objects and developed pressure and temperature in the contact zone. 
The theory about electrolyte and a galvanic exchange is interesting but in my research using a SOFS (slider-on-flat-surface) tribo-tester, revealed a clear difference between exhibited contacts found in the tracks after testing. An electrolyte and a galvanic exchange should always be present, which was not observed using the above equipment. 

If you are interested in the argumentation read the reference and perhaps include it as a reference in the Wiki text about galling.

"""=== Page is in rough shape ===
With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  """"proposed benefits of basic income"""" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality """"blog classifiable"""" sources available.

In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)

Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   

Proposed Benefits

naturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:
 Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.
 Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.
 Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened
 Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.
 Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.
 Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.
 Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.
 Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.
 It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.
 Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.

"Who is Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory

 Welcome to visit Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory.

Obrides was born in 2006. Before 2010, Obrides mainly did business with wholesalers from all over the world and didn't produce dresses. All our dresses are bought from other factories, so the dresses quality and delivery time can not be controlled by us. In this case, we decided to set up our own factory, so that we can provide better service and dresses quality. In March, 2010, the New Obrides was born. In the first week of March 2010, first hundreds of wedding dresses has been delivered to our wholesalers, who would like to place more orders to New Obrides.

Now, we do wholesale business and retail business and provide OEM service. Our products include wedding dresses & gowns, evening dresses, flower girl dresses and wedding accessories. In recent years, we have delivered dresses to almost all countries and now more and more customers contact us to order their dreamed dresses. What are you waiting for? Please just contact us if you need any dress.

When the CRU presents evidence of a hack, it can be called a hack.  Until such time, Occam's Razor leans towards it being either the act of a whistle-blower, or (since there is significant evidence in both the computer code itself, and in previous errant leaks of accidentally putting files on a web server that they did not intend to release) that this is typical data mismanagement because Jones and CRU apparently wouldn't hire anybody with any IT professionals (for fear that anyone outside the cabal would have blown the whistle a decade ago?)

"On inspection, the references to '1996' in the 'Jim Bell' article are not footnoted.  (And, they never have been, since Skomorokh added them 2 years ago).  The AP essay was begun about April 1995, and eventually grew to include 10 parts.  The first 7 parts were written in 1995, and were published immediately as they were written.  Part 8 was a copy of an article by a journalist, Paul Maxwell, writing in the Asahi Evening News (English language newspaper in Japan).   It and parts 9 and 10 were written about February 1996.  You can be sure that by July 1995, 'the Feds' were well aware of the content of the (then-growing) AP essay. The Feds subsequently concealed their early knowledge of the AP article:  One technique they used, when the applied for a warrant, was for the affiant to claim something like, 'I first became aware of the AP essay on....'   That specific affiant ['affidavit writer' for you who don't know the law] may very well have 'first become aware' on some late date, but that doesn't mean that other Feds weren't aware, months or well over a year before.  It served the purposes of the Feds to make it appear not merely that the AP essay was written far closer to Bell's May 1997 arrest, but also to conceal the fact of their agent Walsh/Wilson's involvement perhaps one year prior to Bell's first attendance of MCCLC meetings.  Why?   It sounds much more like an 'emergency' if something happened yesterday, or last week:  They certainly wouldn't have wanted to have to tell the judge, 'Well, Bell wrote this TERRIBLE essay...two years ago' !!!
This explains, I believe, why Skomorokh claimed the AP essay was written in '1996', and furthermore gave no references. '1996' (at least, December 1996) sounds reasonably close to early 1997.  'April 1995', on the other hand, sounds like an eternity from May 1997, the month Bell was arrested.  71.36.117.224",0

It has a big natural resource in fish due to be a continental shelf larger than Greenland size. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for
eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass
was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains
incomplete.http://www.ccamlr.org/ccamlr_science/Vol-16-2009/01Duhamel-Hautecoeur.pdf

The continental shelf teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' abyssal plain. The pelagic (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone, and the benthic (sea floor) province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone.Pinet 316-17, 418-19.
Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and hydrocarbon extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the Convention on the Continental Shelf drawn up by the UN's International Law Commission in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

France extend its jurisdiction over 567 732 square kilometers of the neighboring continental shelf from the land area of 7 215 resulting in 574 947 square kilometers. There are besides some fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island, a department of France approximately 3,300 km (2,100 miles) to the north, who are licensed to fish within the archipelago's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Govern of France principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus mostly on scientific research, earth sciences and biology. 
The so-called Kerguelen microcontinent or Kerguelen Plateau include charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level an covered by dense conifer forest.  Tt sanks 20 million years ago and is now  below sea level. It has sedimentary rocks similar to the ones found in Australia and India, suggesting it was gondwanan origen.

The former sounding rocket range to the east of Port-aux-Français  is currently the site of a SuperDARN radar.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station which is located four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. There was a need for a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, foreign place like Australia or New Zealand.""""

I appreciate your opinion and that is why I am asking you to justify why we should ignore the sources for alternative names of those people. You are right that these people are known as """"Makedonski Muslimani"""" (more accurately - Makedonci Muslimani) or Torbeši, but there are evidences that there are more alternative names and they aren't outdated. There is external link in the article which isn't added by me. Please, look the text in it - """"Muslims in Macedonia belong to five ethnic groups. These are Albanians, Turks, Roma, Muslim Macedonians ( also known as Torbeshi, Pomaks or Poturs) and Bosnians"""".....""""A Greco-Turkish Convention on the Obligatory Exchange of Populations in 1923 made some 390,00 Muslims mostly Turks, but also some Pomaks (Torbesi)-leave for Turkey (Ortakovski, 1997:133)"""". Is this text is about the same people or it isn't?
The question about the other two names is the same and there is sources from nowadays which proved it. The book by Russian author Dmitriy Labauri is from 2008. The term there is Bulgarian Pomaks. Through the good finding, made by Подпоручикъ we have a reference to Fihret Adanir. The term used by him is Bulgarian Muslims. Between other references there is a book Поп Антов, Христо. Спомени, Скопje 2006 (Pop Antov, Hristo. Memoires, Skopje 2006). The author used consistently the term Pomaks, describing these people, but the editor (Professor Zoran Tododrovski from Republic of Macedonia) have not considered it necessary anywhere in the book to explain what that means (if the term is ineligible) or that this is outdated term.
Concerning your claims that these people have been called """"Bošnjaci"""" in the past, can you provide some references? It is interesting for me.  """,0

- the article states that they activists """"attempted to board,"""" but not """"trespassed.""""
- """"Certain pharmaceutical drugs are kept in a safe. The Russian authorities broke the safe after they took the vessel.[36]"""" Sounds like it was written by GP. Relies on a GP source.
- """"Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb despite being blasted with water, whilst another activist was unable to attach themself to the platform."""" Aside from the poor style, the poor construction, and the awkward attempt to make it gender neutral, it reads like the person that wrote the sentence wants the reader to cheer for the GP activists. What does it mean """"to attach oneself to a platform""""? 
- """"Russian authorities forcibly took control of the Arctic Sunrise, which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen Federal Security Service officers in balaclavas, armed with guns and knives."""" Is it unusual that the Federal Service would wear balaclavas or arm themselves with guns and knives? Given the task that they were performing, such a uniform seems routine.
- """"At the time of the boarding, the Arctic Sunrise was in Russia's EEZ but not within the safety zone around the oil rig, and permission was not sought to board it from the Arctic Sunrise's flag state, the Netherlands."""" Does Russia need permission from NL to board a ship that is clearly dedicated to enabling activists to trespass on a Russian oil rig? It's implied. If it's true, it should be noted. If not, it should be removed. 
- """"It is alleged that crew members and activists were punched and kicked during the forced boarding."""" Alleged by whom? Why were they punched and kicked? Were the guards using more than the necessary amount of force to subdue non-cooperative and/or combative arrestees? 
- The use of the monicker """"Arctic 30"""" implies a sympathetic viewpoint. Just because certain media have used the term, doesn't mean that WP should also. Just because certain media organizations are sympathetic doesn't mean WP should be also. It becomes a biased article when it uses such monickers that are intended to create sympathy for those arrested. 
- Nearly the entire """"Responses"""" section is irrelevant except for the responses and requests from the Gov't of NL. Seriously, does anyone really consider it WP worthy that a reporter wrote something on Facebook?
- The """"Greenpeace Announcements"""" section seems like a thinly veiled medium for advocating GP's position. Perhaps a """"Russian Government Announcements"""" would balance the article a bit, but the idea of such a section seems silly. 
- International Reaction section. Again, seems like a thinly veiled medium for listing anyone and any no one that supports GP. I don't see the relevance. Additionally, how is this section different from the """"Responses"""" section?""",0

"Plummer published in 1896. Mike Christie and I are working on Bede's article, and the general assesment of most modern scholars is that the letter is genuine.

"Hank Zipzer- Barfing in the Back Seat
Hank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. 
Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Since Hank didn’t complete the homework packet, he had no idea what words will come out of Ms Adolf’s mouth this time. Anyway, Hank didn’t care about not completing his homework because always getting detention was usual for him.",0

I have some old photographs of the Carousels (I believe it was a 75th anniversary celebration, circa 1999). I am wondering if we should create a separate article (given that the region is known as the Carousel Capitol of the World). Otherwise, I can post them here, or in the respective city articles. Let me know what you think. Thanks for your excellent content and edits, Mahatmabenfoo! Nimur 

Mahatmabenfoo replied: Hi, Nimur! I can't figure out yet how to contact you, so hopefully you will read this. First, thanks for the compliments! I don't live in Johnson City anymore, but I have an ongoing interest in the area, and visit it periodically. I have a collection of pictures and postcards of the E-J plants, but I haven't learned to upload them yet.

A separate article about the Carousel Capitol of the World makes sense. Many people who will be interested in the Carousels of the triple cities will have little interest in E-J who's factories are now mostly long gone.

I suggest you leave the very short treatment I gave the subject (as an enduring legacy of Endicott-Johnson), but yes, yes! a link to a separate more in depth article would be terrific. There's a lot to say about Carousels generally, and what percentage of the total of wood carved ones are in the Triple Cities area, and all that. I'll happily leave all that to you, and I'll be happy to send you what research I have on the chance you will want to use it. For example, how's this as an amazing bunch of (what are probably) facts: Between 1880 and 1930, the golden age of carousels, over 10,000 were built. Fewer than 200 remain and six of them are in Broome County! Nationwide only 13 carousels remain at the site where they were originally built, five of those are in Broome County (the Highland Park carousel was originally at Ideal Park now the site of U-E football stadium).

"Romanization 

Modified Hepburn romanization (as described below) should be used in all cases, excepting those cases where another romanization is determined to be in common usage in reliable sources.
Japanese terms should be romanized according to common usage in English-language reliable sources as indicated by policy, including unconventional romanization of titles and names by licensees (e.g., Devil Hunter Yohko and Tenjho Tenge—see below)—words used frequently in English (such as sumo or judo), the official English name for companies and organizations (e.g., Kodansha rather than Kōdansha, Doshisha University rather than Dōshisha University), or location names (e.g., Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Kyushu, Honshu, Hokkaido, Ryukyu Islands, Bonin Islands, Iwo Jima). The list of examples given here is not exhaustive. Redirects for all likely romanizations should be created to make sure people will be able to find the articles easily regardless of which form they use in their search.
To determine if the non-macronned form is in common usage in English-language reliable sources, a review should be done of all the related reliable sources used for the article (as well as any which may not have been specifically used, but can still be considered reliable per WP:RS). This may be redetermined periodically (generally no more often than semiannually) as usage changes over time and as new additional reliable sources become available. If it can not be determined whether the non-macronned form is in common usage in English-language reliable sources, then the macronned form should be used until such time as it can be determined.
If an article uses English-language reliables source and those sources use a particular form of romanization to name a topic, give preference to that romanization in the article title and body text. If an article uses only Japanese-language reliable sources, use the romanization given in them. If no romanization is given by the reliable sources used in an article, use modified Hepburn romanization. In all cases, the same romanization should be used for the article title and the body text (within that article and within the body text of other articles).
Please note that scholarly reliable sources (e.g., encyclopedias, academic journals, documentaries, and textbooks) and mainstream media (e.g., newspapers, magazines, and television reports) reliable sources are equally acceptable, and neither should be considered more valid than the other. However, more recent reliable sources should generally be given preference over older reliable sources, especially in topics and areas where current understanding may be more complete than older understanding (e.g., in science and technology).

Second, Montreal is behind not only Paris, but also Abidjan and Lyon in population; thus if there's a """"distinction"""" of being the second most populus French-speaking city, it belongs to Abidjan (if not Kinshasa  which remains an open question).  Third, making a point about what city really is the second most populus French-speaking city is out of place in this article, although it would be useful to state why there is uncertainty about whether or not Kinshasa is a French-speaking city. In closing, it is odd that the primary language of the capital of the Deomocratic Repblic of the Congo cannot be determined in a referenceable way.  This seems to be an urgent need for this article  or, more specifically, it seems an urgent need to referencably quantify the linguistic makeup of the city.

"""

Sad that some editors jumped to conclusions without reading or analyzing the article or using the proper AfD process, but I recognize that there is a lot of emotion these days. It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it.

First I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it's step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles.  The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha (an Russian Olympic mascot, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed.

Next I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. 

I created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref'd the heck out every statement per BPL which says """"We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion."""". Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliably sourced to published sources with inline citations.

I did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling info from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where info seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I've found so far is an AP article. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1.1 million hits on Google for """"Boston Marathon Misha"""" as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. 

The article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio info (granted there is limited info to report). Mostly it summarizes a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam's radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the refs were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources.  

There is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. My goal was to write an over referenced, comprehensive, neutral, informative article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far.  Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was redirected (as a sub for a deletion nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. 

BLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime.

The absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name 
Anyway, considering how many people are searching this guy I expect he will be found and a page will get created or restored.  Cheers,   """,0
"Moved to draft space==
I've moved this copypasted pastiche to draft space as it wasn't ready for mainspace.   A few points to remember:

There is nothing to split from the cuisine of Hawaii article.  Splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere.  That is not the situation here.  There is nothing to remove from the parent topic.  
What was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article.  This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.  That's not how this works.
You basically duplicated the entire cuisine of Hawaii article here.  Since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here.  If you don't know what the cuisine of Native Hawaii entails, then do the research.  It does not mean any food that anyone of Native Hawaiian ethnicity eats.  It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.
When you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references.  As a result,  nobody can easily verify the content.  Of course, I can, since I'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  You can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  You will need to add each single full reference to this article.  Don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.
Per the MOS, please do not surround text with multiple images.  Candleabracadabra, you've been reminded of this many times now.  

Keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work.  This will involve serious research on your part. It will not involve copying and pasting material from already existing articles.

 User:Varsovian 

Instead of keeping a low profile for awhile he immediately inserted himself into a discussion on WikiProject about the Nazi collaborator Anthony Sawoniuk. The nationality of Anthony Sawoniuk is yet determined, the only source which says his mother was Polish is a newspaper article. In a provocative style Varsovian started to compare the Nazi collaborator and war criminal Sawoniuk with Frederic Chopin(!).  """"That makes him more Polish than Chopin!"""", """"If Sawoniuk isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""". I have asked him what has Chopin to do with Sawoniuk and reply was this:  """"if he isn't Polish, neither is Chopin"""", """"Unless we can find a source which says that Sawoniuk's father was a nationality other than Polish, Sawoniuk is purely Polish"""". This is crazy, he should provide sources that Sawoniuk and his father is Polish not others that he is not. Not happy enough that he needlessly dragged Chopin's name into the discuss on a Nazi collaborator, he opened a new section titled Chopin vs Sawoniuk. . I asked him to provide sources:  and the reply was this:  no sources provided and more comparisons between F.Chopin and Sawoniuk. He also accused me that I am """"trying to distract attention from yet another warning you this week received despite being under a DIRWIGEN official caution"""". I am most certainly not trying to distract attention from anything but I have a problem when somebody compares a Nazi collaborator of uncertain nationality with Frederic Chopin. I request you review if Varsovian's conduct is not in violation of the standards expected in the EE area.  

I'm not looking at it here. If you believe that an editor's conduct warrants sanctions, please make a request on WP:AE, which provides a transparent framework for the examination of such matters.  """,0
"Editors here, please stop telling others to stop discussing this subject.

One thing is for certain, there is no clear consensus that we should have no kind if article on this subject, in fact, I am not sure that such a thing is even possible within the ethos of WP.

One way to resolve this issue is to have a civil discussion on what would be a suitable title for the subject that has been discussed at length here (I propose 'Tau (circle constant)' then start an article on the subject on that page and then start an AfD.

 Archiving 

Are you sure all those pages need an archive setup ?   (open channel) 
 I believe so, they didn't have one before and now they'll be enabled for the OCA script for whenever it becomes necessary.  Is there a reason not to have that? it's not affecting the talk pages until someone decides to use it right? B E C K Y  S A Y L E S  
 My concern is a """"mass"""" setup should be discussed first.   (open channel) 
 Becky, yes.  Generally,  shouldn't be the only archiving on article talk pages.  If archiving is to be set up on those pages, it should be automatic archiving using .  Using that will still allow usage of OCA if there is a section with no timestamp or something else preventing automatic archiving.  Also, talk pages should generally not be archived if they are less than 75K in size.  Please go back through your list and change all of them to use  instead of . I'll also note that setting up archiving on talk pages like this usually only occurs once a discussion is started on the talk page to see if there is any objection, if there is consensus or no comments, or if the page is above the 250K threshold.  Thank you. — {{U|}} (e • t • c) 
 I have undone the addition of {{Archive basics}}. Can you help me understand the difference? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by """"OCA shouldn't be the only archiving on article talk pages""""? Using {{User:MiszaBot/config}} sets up automatic archiving. But {{Archive basics}} doesn't, it just sets up for use of OCA.  So if someone wanted automatic archiving, {{User:MiszaBot/config}} could still be added, right? Help:Archiving a talk page  says archiving is suggested when there's resolved or stale discussions. So isn't it unnecessary/improbable to have a discussion on archiving resolved/stale discussions?   B E C K Y  S A Y L E S  
 Sorry about the delay. I got got up in some `stuff` that prevented me from replying sooner. OneClickArchiver is intended for archiving a user's own talk page.  It is also useful for archiving sections that bots don't archive automatically on other talk pages for various reasons.  While it is acceptable to use only OneClickArchiver on a user's talk page if that is what they wish and the size of their page doesn't get out of hand, bots should archive all other talk pages.

 Possible amicus appeals 

I thought this comment might be of interest. It indicates that anyone could file an appeal of the block, provided the blocked party indicates he wants to appeal it and indicates where he wants the appeal to be made. Under the circumstances, I think it might be possible that a thread could be opened, maybe at ANI, requesting the block be lifted, or, if that proves unsuccessful or doesn't appeal to you, requesting some sort of discretionary sanctions on individuals who might seek to prejudicially malign others. Under the circumstances, I think that there might be a reasonable chance of the block being lifted based on the prejudicial misrepresentation to which you were responding. Alternately, I think that there might be a very sound basis for requesting that backhanded libellous misrepresentation in the matter of the """"c""""-word might be made subject to discretionary sanctions on its own. 

The question of whether you want to appeal is obviously your choice. But, whether you choose to or not, I would be interested in knowing what you might think of maybe requesting discretionary sanctions regarding further misrepresentation.

 EVHS 

Hi, 

I saw you've been editing the EVHS article.  I wanted to bring a few things to your attention.  The user evhs00 has basically been copying the Los Alamos High School article.  (see for yourself).  Problem is that he's copied a great deal of stuff that does not apply to EVHS.  For instance he makes a serious of false, baseless and dubious claims:

 EVHS was one of Newsweek's 2007 """"1,000 Best High Schools in America"""" (#598).  This was baselessly copied from the LAHS article and is just false when applied to EVHS: 

http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=Rank&count;=1351&Search;=&start;=500&limit;=100&year;=2007&

 EVHS is """"mostly middle class"""".  A dubious claim considering espanola is one of the poorer cities in one of the poorest states and has 21% of its population living beneath the poverty level:

http://www.city-data.com/city/Espanola-New-Mexico.html

 Many other claims are suspect, uncited, and bear a clear similarity to claims on the LAHS article.   

Additionally, 

 The image of the sundevil mascot was taken from the Arizona State University article and is not fair use.

 The image of the basketball team was taken from the EVHS Athletics website and is not fair use. 

Basically there's no citations anywhere and the author's methodology is clearly one of blatant copying.  I really want to avoid an edit-war between rival high school articles so I'm not going to touch the EVHS article.  I'm actually really glad that somebody is working on the EVHS page.  But the author needs to learn how to work within the rules.

My own opinion is that adding plain """"external links"""" should be avoided once an article has substantial content. A previous editor mentioned """"linkspam"""" and, while this link might not quite fit within that term, the website itself didn't seem to have a lot of other content (but I could be wrong) and the """"substantiality"""" of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate.

Oh noes. How will I ever recover from you not giving me any respect. Perhaps I'll reflect on the fact that a) you're a total moron who wouldn't know a true benefit to Wikipedia if it hit you in the face, and b) most, if not all, of what you know about me has been filtered through the grubby hands of Future Perfect, et al. They control what version of the truth you see here. The sad fact is, you don't have a fucking clue about what I've been doing. According to Future, I've been accusing Werieth of being a sock, without evidence. Which in his book is trolling/harassment. That's his version. Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll. I can't spell it out any more clearer than this - he never wanted Betacommand banned, he never wanted Werieth exposed. Just do the fucking math, or forever be his loyal subject, whose only true freedom is to lick his (jack) boots for the iron in the dirt. Seriously, if you're goal is to persuade me to not lift a finger when I figure out what Beta's next account name is, you're the one doing a 'stand up' job.   22:35",0

 2/0 

Cla, I think the evidence against 2/0 is overwhelming if you want to escalate this to arbcom. I have repeatedly asked 2/0 to temper his actions on this probation, because he has a history of over-reacting against one side while defending the other. Take a look at his log of blocks over the last 6 months and it's practically a who's who of the """"skeptic"""" side of this debate, without a single sanction against the other side. This alone is not an indictment, but if you examine the actions he did NOT take, particularly his passionate, 20-point defense of WMC after one of WMC's temper tantrums, his harsh actions against skeptics are all the more suspect. He's the anti-Lar: whereas Lar tends to speak his mind but ultimately respects consensus, 2/0's discussion is impeccably calm and neutral, while his actions are clearly one-sided.

The International Astronomical Union invented the designation """"dwarf planet"""" in 2006.

The statement that there are """"hundreds or thousands of dwarf planets"""" is not accurate; there may be hundreds of candidate objects, some of which might some day be accepted as dwarf planets, and there may be thousands of objects yet to be discovered which might be candidates for being labelled dwarf planets, but at this moment, there are only five objects which actually are dwarf planets. Because """"dwarf planet"""" is an arbitrary label, we cannot reasonably say that, say, Sedna or Quaoar are dwarf planets; they would only become dwarf planets at such future date as they may be named as such, which depends upon obtaining accurate data as to their size, mass, composition, and shape, which is not as yet available. To say definitively that there are dwarf planets other than the five that have been named goes far beyond what Wikipedia is entitled to do.

He is talking about commonsense. I don’t think so even he has an iota of that.

If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups, what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State.

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE.

I couldn’t understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTE's activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils.

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities.

Composing the LTTE leader's annual speech or representing LTTE doesn’t qualify him for the """"Terrorist Tag"""" at all.

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE.

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations.

I don’t know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him. For what?
Here anyone can comment independently and dragging a wikipedian to discuss with some other wikipedians is not acceptable. Then he can come out with his opinions here.

This page should not be speedy deleted because...   

Given that a number of Australian curators are already listed and are not the subject of dispute, there is clearly no reason why a curator, per se, can't be considered worthy of a Wikipedia entry. While Julie Robinson certainly isn't at the same level of public awareness as Betty Churcher or Brian Kennedy, her work is still significant, particularly in the field of Australian photography, which in my opinion is currently somewhat underrepresented on Wikipedia. The two exhibitions mentioned in the first paragraph where clearly of importance within that context, and as soon as I have the opportunity I intend to add a page on Century In Focus. Very briefly, that was a three-month exhibition at one of Australia's most important public galleries, accompanied by a large-format book that was distributed by Thames & Hudson. Ms Robinson spent years working on it, as the head of a team of curators. As Sebastian Smee, himself a Pulitzer Prize winner, put it: """"If you are at all interested in Australian photography, whether or not you are from SA, you will want to see this show, or at least get hold of the catalogue.""""

Dpmuk has mentioned elsewhere that """"None of the sources are about her and there is no other indication of notability."""" I don't dispute that they are, in fact, about her work, but I don't believe that makes the page invalid. It was never intended to be an in-depth discussion of her personal history or background, but instead is meant to provide a way for people to find out more about her work, which, I'll reiterate, is certainly of importance. Exhibitions are an important part of our public culture – they inspire and educate – and as such they fully deserve to be written about.

There would obviously be no place for mention of the other exhibitions that Ms Robinson has curated in the page on Candid Camera or Century in Focus, so removing the page, while perhaps making Wikipedia more compliant and slightly tidier in dpmuk's view, will also remove what was always intended as a hub for people to learn more about art and photography in Australia. Personally, I don't know enough to add entries for all of the other exhibitions she has curated, but I'd like to think that, in time, they too will have their own pages, and the page currently in question will still be here to serve as a hub for further discovery.

Liberal Bias claim

 Coming to an understanding 

I've done most of the lion's share of edits on this article, but I want to make it clear that my interest is in having a neutral article, and that I'm not trying to push the idea that the Seth Material is true or valid (that's a judgement that the article can't make).

I inserted the first instance of the word """"purportedly"""" (even though it is on the list of words to avoid) because I felt it was needed, and I have reinstated it when other editors removed it.  Someone named """"Itsmejudith"""" has just changed the word """"awareness"""" to """"the idea"""", and I support that change.

And despite what you may have thought (speaking to Verbal now), when I substituted """"Jane Roberts, speaking as Seth, said"""" for """"the Seth personality said"""", I believed that I was making a change that was a leap forward in neutrality (since Roberts was the one who actually uttered the words).

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff. 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.

I approached  reasonably and got the same sort of response as you did, see ; . When  started to engage in his revisions without consultation, I tried to engage him in reasonable discussion, see ; . But he just ignores it.

Fine. I showed respect, they showed themselves for what they are.

I find it weird in a way that individuals can become so obsessed by something that they obviously do not love but instead want to demean or destroy - and that means you now - and are willing to invest so much time and energy into it.

I could understand it if  was a paid employee of the meat industry - he says he has professional scientific interest in animal husbandry. That would just make him a paid publicist. But if he is doing this and attacking you in his own free time, I pity him deeply.

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

"Massacre of Turkish civilians in Galati and Iasi

[1]the massacre of Turks at Galatz and Jassy..

[1]the cruel and cowardly murders of Turkish merchants, in the towns of Galatz and Jassy..

In regards to F.'s status as a reliable source however, there should be no argument about that. F. most certainly qualifies. He is one of the most high-profile scholars on the Arab-Israeli question, he has received plaudits from other greatly respected experts in the field (see Schlaim's endorsement above, or that of Raul Hilberg who supported his work and said he would be """"vindicated"""" by history), and he has written best selling books on the conflict that have been  praised both inside and outside academia and translated into multiple languages. His book A Nation on Trial was named a notable book for 1998 by the New York Times. His latest book """"Beyond Chutzpah"""" was published by the University of California Press after perhaps the most thorough peer review of any book on the conflict ever. These achievements demonstrate that he is unquestionably a reliable source in Wikipedia terms.

In spite of this however, some pro-Israeli editors have seized upon his recent denial of tenure as a rationale for trying to exclude him as a source on the grounds that this failure has somehow discredited his scholarship. This is simply not the case. DePaul did not question the quality of his scholarship. In fact, it endorsed him as """"a prolific writer and outstanding teacher"""". F. was denied tenure only because someone didn't like his attitude. But there is nothing in Wiki policies that disqualify sources on the basis of some alleged flaws of personality. It's only the reliability of their scholarship that matters, and F. has no shortage of endorsements in that regard.

"Double Standards & Issues -  

 

Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.

As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder",0

I think there is possibly scope for a separate article.  For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by """"rectangular coordinate system"""".

But assuming that the tensoriality of things is supposed to be trivial here, then the article should not dwell too much on this aspect of things (as it presently does).  The likely audience of the article will only get confused by this, and those looking for a more comprehensive treatment of tensors have other articles to select from.  I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester's law, in my opinion, because it's very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    """,0

You also say that the Rin tin tin Museum was """"short lived"""" and make not reference as to where this information is substantiated and yet the Museum still exists today.

You also say that Jannettia Brodsgaaard Propps amassed a collection of memorabilia which she did not. She never collected Anything. It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.

There are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the """"conflict"""" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their """"version"""" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.

I now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed """"Smith"""" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII. We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected. 

And again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin - if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldn't you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page.? I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a """"mention."""" He had no direct involvment in the """"making"""" of the film.

I would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone """"mentions"""" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.

"Carcass Wikipedia 

Hello,

I hope you are well. My name is Bill and I play guitar in a band called Carcass. It appears you have taken it upon yourself to edit our Wikipedia page, even going so far as to undo any recent attempts on our part to correct the numerous mistakes that are present. Now, while we do appreciate that there may be good intentions at work, the bottom line is that someone we have never even met has decided that they know more about our band's history than we do. And that is annoying, to put it mildly.

If all of this was done from a fan's perspective and a genuine (if misguided) desire to set the record straight, I must thank you for your efforts. In many ways I can relate to that position as I still consider myself a fan of music first, a musician second. But I also know I wouldn't ever have the nerve to try and govern any of my favourite bands' Wikipedia pages.

Given that this is the insane world of the internet, I won't make the rash assumption that you are actually an admirer of our band. This wouldn't be the first time that someone who dislikes us has chosen to spread misinformation online. But in the (perhaps unlikely) event that you are interested and prepared to listen, let me know and I will explain which details are wrong, and why. There are quite a few and in all honesty I don't want to waste my time going through all of this unless you are genuinely concerned.

All the best,

Have you seen The Women Outside: Korean Women and the U.S. Military. Directors J.T. Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?

Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who """"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley"""".

Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

It says. """"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

Below I am pasting an email from a historian, whom I asked about the correct title.| talk  

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.
It is normally preferable to keep the German term, italicized, and give a sentence or so of explanation.""",0

Re 
I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.  
CSD G10 does use the term """"negative in tone"""", which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that """"biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone"""" should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a """"porn actor"""" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a """"porn actor"""", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a """"porn actor"""" is sufficiently """"controversial in tone"""" to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

Christian mythology would include things like the legends of the saints in the Golden Legend and so on, would it not? Calling those """"Abrahamic"""" seems somewhat anachronistic given how removed they are geographically and temporally from the Hebrew Bible. Furthermore, if this article discusses specifically Christian (not Jewish or Muslim) interpretations of the myth in question at any point (I'm not a topic expert and I haven't looked at the article in much detail anyway), then adding a category that befits that would be appropriate.

Tone and style of article

Just a passerby and not a wikipedia editor per se. However, I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article: it suffer from sounding very personal, and has a tone of what one would expect a non-scholar explaining something in emphatic language. (the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom, but there are other, such as the """"for the benefit of Europeans"""", which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article.) I'm not an expert on the subject (in fact I know very little about it, which is why I came here), but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatises/works on the subject instead of going into a quasi-emotional and ambiguous personal essay-style on the subject. It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and """"acceptable"""" (as in, lacking cultural, ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized) as possible - and this makes the article sounds a little - dare I say - """"New Agey"""". (for lack of a better term.) I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great Spirit/Mystery (and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject, as one would expect from proper research) - if those are available - as opposed to the currently rather watered-out explanation. 

As this is a very interesting subject, I'm looking forward to seeing how the article develops. ) Best of luck.

 Err... making Libertarianism an exception in this fashion seems like rather blatant Special pleading.

Not to bate charges of anti-semitism (or make conjectural accusations), but there is a problem with pages like this on Wikipedia, too (including Americans), as the Jewish population is inevitably better-represented than groups that don't per capita possess so many of the characteristic prescribed by Wikipedia as being typical of its user base, including higher income levels, literacy, access to technology, etc. These conditions, unfortunately, are condusive to incidents of systemic bias - how many Palestinians are frequent Wikipedians?

While diglossia as a field of research or even the concept might have flowered long past Caldwell, its quite inconceivable that Caldwell would have been unaware of this diglossia.  Infact, in speaking about the difficulty that the untrained or sometimes even the trained Tamil(and I certainly and strongly feel that he is talking about people who have received their training in Tamil Nadu.  I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.

Be that as it may, what studies in diglossia in Tamil over the last several decades would have done is merely deal with the 'problem' in greater detail and throw light on such things as the causes for diglossia, 'evolution', perpetuation etc., of this phenomenon over the centuries and other things of academic interest like that.

What I am trying to say is, while scientific interest and research into diglossia might be a development of the last few decades, 'diglossia'(in tamil) existed nonetheless, even before that.  And like I said, Caldwell has only touched upon it though not gone deeper into it to research the more intricate details of it.

Notwithstanding that, the fact remains that the ordinary Tamil, especially one without formal(or informal) training, is often at a loss to understand Classical tamil enough to fully appreciate its beauty.

so, imo, the lines that are already there should be retained as it is.  But, you should also(before those lines, preferably) make a mention of the diglossia that exists in Tamil, the different levels, the continuum etc., and then conclude that... """"....as a result of the said diglossia, the ordinary Tamil, sometimes even with formal training, is at a loss to understand the language of classical literature(or the other diglossic levels)""""

And, to answer Sundar's question as to whether (I feel) this is limited to just Tamil or is also a feature of other languages -

While I dont a 'professional grade' knowledge of any language, I've had formal schooling in both Kannada and Hindi.  And I've observed this feature in both languages, much more so in Kannada.  In Kannada, in fact, if you were to study the 'Mankutimmana Kagga'(written sometime in the 60s or 70s i guess) by D V Gundappa, the language used is somewhat in haLegannaDa style, though I would say, it doesnt 'sound' as haLe(old) as haLegannada.  I am able to understand this work for the most part except in some places where it gets a little too much for me and I might have to refer to the dictionary.

Any literature, regardless of when it was written, but written in pure haLegannada style, I would say, wouldnt make much sense to the untrained eye or ear.  

With Hindi, probably because the language is much younger than Kannada or Tamil, though I've observed a sort of diglossia, say in the language that Kabir employs, verses that of Munshi or someone,  Kabir is far more discernable to me than say the Kavirajamarga would be to me or probably Kural to you.

In general, I feel some degree of diglossia almost always exists in most languages(atleast Indian languages) in that, the lingo employed by news readers, say,(atleast in the good old 'Doordarshan only' days), is removed from the one you would hear on the street.  Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.  I am not sure if there's a parallel to this in Tamil or any other language that I have any knowledge of.

"""::Not every work of a non-Catholic was forbidden, but only, among others, every work on religion by a non-Catholic.
I don't know whether the Opus Dei adheres to the index or, as it is said, censures new books, but I may say that if, it wouldn't be to blame for it. It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index.
Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better).
That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so """"on the index"""" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.
As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card. Bertone's semi-censuring) but it may be dangerous and thus imprudent, which can be not free from sin. (?) 84.154.109.57

I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings.

 New archive 
This page has been quiet for a few weeks, so I created a new archive at Talk:Monty Hall problem/Archive 9 for the discussions from mid Oct 2008 through Feb 2009 (indicated as """"archived"""" above).  Several of the issues aren't exactly resolved (they will perhaps never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction), but the period of relative calm seemed like an opportune time to create a new archive.  I added a new section (post archiving) much like this one.  user:Glkanter has reverted these changes, suggesting we talk about it first.  OK.  Since we're at a lull in the discussion here, and the talk page is huge, I suggest now is an appropriate time to archive.   Rick Block (talk) 

 Agree with archiving now. The talk page is monster-sized, and nobody is going to read through it all anyway. –  

I don't agree there has been a 'lull'. It's just been re-directed to the arguments page. I assume most readers (not necessarily editors) do NOT read archives. If they're interested, maybe they get as far as a talk page. Anyway, I think that the existence and vehement nature of the MHP article disagreement would not be evident if the entire thing were archived. A reader might think that there was universal satisfaction with the construction of the article. That would be an inaccurate impression to give.   

This thread will remain here, and it already says there are unresolved issues.  If you'd like to enumerate them here that will remain here as well.  Good enough?  Rick Block (talk) 

I didn't know there was an """"arguments"""" page, so I too thought it had settled down.  It would be very useful to have a concise list here of what the ongoing issues about the article are, phrased as neutrally as possible, with links to where some discussion about them may be found.

 Your edits to Robert Byrd 

I had to revert your edits to the above article for a number of reasons. First of all, articles must conform to WP:NPOV and be writted from a neutral point of view. This applies to critics of his record and supporters that seek to apologize for his past actions. As per Wikipedia policy, the burdern of proof would be on Byrd's critics, and not the senator, regarding whether or not he is still involved in the Klan. Any such implication without a source that he is still a member would, therefore, violate WP:V. Also, the placing of the comment in the first paragraph would violate WP:LEAD. 

Furthermore, the part about Marshall and Thomas is in fact in the article, as (regardless of what his backers may feel) pertinent to his record and is written according to WP policy. While the comments about the other nominees are arguable, you could, if well-sourced (which wouldn't be hard to do), find a quote from respected conservative civil rights activist Niger Innis that called his opposition to Rice and others """"racist"""".

"WP:WEB

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites.",0

_______________________________________________________________________

I have no problem with the Boeing report, but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article.  This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem.
The mass of a space tether goes up with length.  Assuming it could take the thermal environment, you can build a space tether out of kite string.  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string.  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends.  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass.  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth, hence not practical.  That doesn't mean that you still can't use that kite string to fly a kite, obviously you can.  The difference is in the length.  The space elevator is 100,000 km long.  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most.  The same applies to skyhooks.  You could build a 100,000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn't practical.  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite, a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4,000 km range is possible.
As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that.  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded.  References 7, 18, and 19 are open source.  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non-rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper.  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google, it is open source.  
Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it.  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers.  For that I recommend the """"Tether in Space Handbook"""", it is also open source on the internet, see reference 7.
You could also just read the abstracts for the non-open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept.  Or you could just notice who is writing these reports; NASA, reference 19, Lockheed Martin, references 5, 8, 9, and 10, and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, reference 7.  Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie?

To conclude with the Boeing report.  The Boeing report says 
1) """"His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth, achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5.0 km/s (16 kft/s or Mach 16) airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass.""""

5.0 km/s is 64% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built.  I have no argument with this.

2) """"Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4.0 km/s (13 kft/s or Mach 13) would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass.""""

4.0 km/s is 51% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic.  Again no disagreement.

The tether tip speeds for the non-rotating skyhook examples in this article, and in all the references I have listed, start at 96% of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70% of low Earth orbit velocity.  There is no reason to go any lower.
As a result, the final line of the Boeing quote, """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts. """" does not apply for two reasons.  1) It doesn't apply to the skyhook lengths in the article, and 2) it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks.

Do you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non-rotating skyhooks in this article?

PS  The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it.  Since you keep deleting references with your changes, the reference numbers keep changing, hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything.

So please, read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying.
If you run into any problems that you cannot resolve easily, write me here and I will do what I can to assist you.""",0

Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use the sandbox for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.

Why should I be involved be anymore editing (although I really want to) when I know that some daft hater may simply revert ALL of them without caring much about silly things like justification or consequence and I will be blocked as a result? I shouldn't be involved. Wikipedia, like any other bureaucracy, is ruled by bullies (including some administrators). However, the real bureaucracies do give you a chance to settle the dispute in court or police station. And at least you can afford to not be so helpless about it. Here my edits were labelled as propaganda (implying that I'm a propagandist) after all my edits were rashly reverted (although they had the chance to simply modify inaccuracies with good sources, they chose to delete the whole section), nothing was done and because nothing was done, the reversion of my edits only accelerated (now, if not all, most of my edits are entirely reverted).

That's not a very efficient way, that is rather a crazy medieval way of discerning what's reliable and what's not. And thus, implies that minority is always wrong and majority is always correct. That's fundamentally incorrect., real world seems like a much better place to dwellAlthough I concede that some (few) of my sources too were questionable and faced justified skepticism, I don't think that it necessitated a whole reversion.

Rand is not a philosopher
I don't think we ever resolved one big problem with the article: Rand is not a philosopher. The article continues to push the POV suggestion that she is indeed a philosopher, which is an opinion only supported by her and her followers. There is only one professor in all of academia that supports the idea that she is a philosopher, and thus the article is pushing an extreme minority view as the truth. We are essentially doing the complete opposite of what we are supposed to do with psuedoscience articles in an article about psuedophilosophy. The NPOV warning will remain on this article until we truly resolve this dispute.  LGagnon 

A few suggestions for what we should do with this article:
Change the infobox to Template:Infobox Writer
Remove all POV claims that she is a philosopher; replace them with something along the lines of """"Rand claimed to be a philosopher.""""
Do not refer to Objectivism as a philosophy; a term such as """"ideology"""" would be more neutral.
Remove categories that refer to her as a philosopher.  LGagnon 

Also, I'd like to point out this line from the article:
Rand viewed herself primarily as a novelist, not a philosopher  LGagnon 

Response to Suggestions

There are too many conceptual difficulties with LGagnon's suggestions. Again, we need good grounding, not unsourced opinion.

To begin. The distinction between philosophy proper and pseudo-philosophy requires a fleshing out of criteria. Don't conflate Anglo-American analytic philosophy with the ubiquitous  belief-system development that preceded it. Or you can scrub virtually all Continental systems (endless varieties of Existentialism(s))from the category (of philosophy).

In fact, the analytic of North America is merely a method for doing philosophy. It eschews systems as such, due to the influence of empiricist/positivist skepticism going all the way back to David Hume. (Recall Hume awakened Kant  at least so Kant relayed  from """"dogmatic slumber."""" Philosophy has not been the same since.)

Further, though we speak of belief-systems, since the decline of the Middle ages, and the notorious rote of the Trivium/Quadrivium, these systems have been increasingly secular and secularized in knowledge and value emphases. 

In that respect, Objectivism is no less than its equally original, equally American conceptual cousin: pragmatism. Indeed, LGagnon's very student-musings about the exact status of Objectivism in this regard remind one of the reception pragmatism suffered (and suffers still) by comparison to earlier Theocentric philosophic systems. William James famously claimed that the very first real lecture on philosophy that he ever attended was the one he himself taught.

Ergo, """"ideology"""" would not be a neutral mode of reference with regard to Objectivism anyway. That loads the controversial """"Objectivism-as-cult"""" smack into the supposedly neutral explication of the system. It utterly distorts the sourcing and external material that is required by Wikipedia. It loads original opinion/research of the most expansive sort. It fails to unpack the place of reason in the Randian corpus. 

Oh incidentally, many, very many philosophers in the analytic school disdain the Continentalists as philosophers. They used to refer to them, when favourably disposed, as philosophes  a la that great Continental Trio of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu).

 How many of the claims will turn out to be untrue? 

It has been said that over 200 people have come forward to make accusations against Savile since this story broke, but the figure of 200 will obviously be on the light side as some victims would have either passed away or not be willing to come forward at this juncture. I find it rather hard to understand why at least some of these victims did not come forward to make accusations whilst he was alive - it has been reported that the odd person got the odd complaint years ago but not to the extent that have popped up recently. If just 10% came forward, that would mean at least 20 complaints, and that figure would not have been secret a for long once the press got hold of the story. I do not profess to understand the workings of the abuser or those that have been abused but it does beg the question - did Savile have such power over his victims that they were so terrified to come forward or are some of the now presented cases just a case of get what you can while you can in this time of recession? It seems that this guy will turn out to be the """"Harold Shipman"""" of the sex abuse world, which says a lot more about the people that allowed him to get away with it than it does about Savile himself.

The problem is not only with the sections concerning """"Controversy about media coverage"""", the major problem is that many major points about the Greek debt crisis are missing in the lead and the article, even though it consists of >100 pages. This is addressed in 
 section #4 - """">100 pages, but still main points missing?""""
 section #5 - """" Why did Greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis? """"
 section #6 -  """" POV / LEAD debate """"
Two weeks ago, I proposed in this section #4 to have the main points at least in summary style in the lead (as important ones are not even in the article)
Just let's only take the first point listed in #4, being joining the Euro without sufficient financial convergence and competitiveness in the summary list of causes for the Greek debt crisis. It is the major single and early root cause for the Greek debt crisis. Without this root cause Greece could technically not have had this debt crisis because it could always have printed itself out of every debt volume as they did before with the drachma. But this cause is missing in the 100 WP pages and in the WP lead. The current lead only lists normal problems like """"structural weaknesses"""" and """"recessions""""  (even though it is clear that Greece faced those normal problems for decades and always solved them with high drachma inflation if needed) - so without naming the root cause there is no cause for the Greek debt crisis.
What happened after I proposed to have the main points in the article (at least in the lead as a summary) and also invited everybody to add/change/delete from my proposed the main point list? There were strong opponents working in a coordinated action, threatening to fight any significant change, saying one can not summarize a Greek debt crisis, saying """"Greek interests [need to have] a prominence"""") when describing the debt crisis in WP, saying they will not let other editors summarize it, and so on.

New copyedit
Arre, I did a revision checking for sources related to each paragraph. I also tried to get the style more academic:

I added: 
 The article is structured as per Wikipidia manual of style. Created section titles. There's now an intro, a history and conditions sections. 
 Gave context to the article by linking the prison to the political life. 
 In the history section gave a better explanation of the existance of the prison by linking it to the failed coup d'état. Also added info about Mon ami le Roi book. Without a history section, the article reader would find no context to follow.
 I added  to the Saharawi inmates. 
 Added Years of lead as a see also as both subjects are related.

I removed:
 capacity for only 56 inmates. Not true. The reference given   talks about getting 56 detainees for the first time.
 summary executions occurred. In the reference we had , there is no such claim. The article puts it as a possibility. 
 The Al-Ahram weekly reference is about the book of Tahar Ben Jelloun and I put if on further readings and kept the link.
 Scorpions and snakes. I removed snakes as Al Jazeera link only reports scorpions.
 feracious is an adjective and by nature we avoid using adjectives in wikipedia in order to avoid pov issues. Cold winter is enough. 
 Surviving inmates have described the experience as """"being buried alive"""" is not well sourced. They may describe it in all possible words but weather someone said explicitly and exactly being buried alive or not, nobody is sure. I also removed a """"death camp"""" rather than a prison for the same reason while I believe that someone would have said it. But again, no sure.

DELETION OR THEN MERGER 

There must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability NRV.

WP:NOPAGE -notability is a very serious question here and the weak and non-scholarly material does not amount to a stand alone article. The article is a combination of some  critic/red flagging of the  criticism of the Frankfurt School theories labelled here as """"Conspiracy Theory"""". Yes it can entertained that some  claims & rumours are discussed on minor internet sites that amount to """"Conspiracy talk"""", but it is no reason for a Wikipedia entry or let alone a stand alone Wikipedia article.

 REASONS FOR DELETION ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY CONCRETE
WP:NPOV neutral point of view! 

WP:OR -The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist

WP:V - means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source. Where available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

WP:FRINGE -A theory that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article

WP:NOTOPINION -Opinion pieces, although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""". 

WP:YESPOV -Avoid stating opinions as facts

WP:WEIGHT -Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and impartial, but still disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news.

 Bioresonance therapy and Scientology 

Hi there

Casting my mind back to January 2010, as evidenced in the diff. I think I wanted to make more precise a previous editor's mention of """"the E-Meter used by Scientology"""" in the Bioresonance therapy article - and so I found the citation which I added, and which as it stands appears to link Franz Morell (rather than bioresonance therapy itself) with Scientology. That """"factoid"""" might live more comfortably on a Wikipedia entry for Franz Morell, but no such article exists... though the article referenced: http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does provide more detail. (The reference you gave to https://tools.wmflabs.org/cluebot/?page=View&id;=1909882 brings up only a blank page in my browser. If the referenced article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf does indeed have methodological deficiencies, we can change our article to state that """"Franz Morell allegedly had links with Scientology'...)

A very rough translation of the cited article http://www.abi-ev.de/pdf/in141103.pdf - based loosely on the translation provided in Google Chrome, looks something like this:

November 14, 2003 III / Dr.HL-se 

Scientology and Bioresonance Therapy

Bioresonance Therapy includes the """"alternative"""" treatment of diseases such as allergies, eczema and asthma and in  """"alternative"""" dental treatment an ever broader space. 
Bioresonance therapy goes back to  an alleged discovery of the in the Year 1990 deceased Frankfurt Doctor and senior Scientologist Dr. Franz Morell. 
Dr. Morell had in the 70s of the 20th century the allegedly """"genius idea"""" of eliminating patients' harmful mood-swings by reflecting them .

[Footnote 1:  Dr. Eva Rasche in a """"MORA Patient information"""" document published by the F. Dermatological  health center Wadern Elvi Foss -  http://www.degezet.de/leistung.htm
] 

Together with his Stepson Erich Rasche, Morell developed in the year 1977 the so-called MORA-therapy and MORA gear necessary for the therapy. 
In just this period of time Dr. Franz Morell was a Scientology activist. 
So founded Dr. Franz Morell on the 12th June 1970 together with six other like-minded people in Frankfurt the Club """"College for Applied Philosophy e.V."""". 
According to the at-the-time built Statute, the Club should exclusively serve """"scientific and research-supporting ends"""" and organize 'Courses for the enhancement of consciousness by practical application of the philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard, known under the name Scientology"""". 
Appart from that,  Dr. Franz Morell co-operated in the year 1975 on the foundation of the Scientology Tranorganisation """"Narconon"""" in Frankfurt. 
Likewise in the Year 1975 was Dr. Franz Morell in the by the Stuttgart Scientology branch issued Magazine College No. 11 referred to as """"for years highly trained Scientologist"""". 
Dr. Franz Morell was, when he made public his method of treatment, since many years an active Scientologist, who openly held L. Ron Hubbard teaching and techniques as an appropriate basis for scientific and educational activity. 
Under the given conditions it appears not surprising that the idea of bioresonance therapy shows parallels to Scientology practices including: While supporters of  Bioresonance therapy believe appropriate equipment can catch harmful moodswings of people and by the generation of corresponding counter-vibrations can weaken or delete them, Scientologists see in so-called engrams a type of spiritual disruption fields, which with Scientology auditing with the help of the bioresonance devices - quite similar to the so-called E-Meter (electric meter) - can be tracked and deleted. 
The MORA-Gerät is still distributed by the Company Med-Tronic Trading Ltd. 
in  Friesenheim. 
Erich Rasche is Managing Director of the Company Med-Tronic. 
In view of the social and family Relations between Dr. Morell and Mr. Rasche one can hardly assume that the activities of the late Franz Morell for Scientology remained hidden to Mr. Rasche.  
The Term """"Bioresonanztherapie"""" was according to the Company Regumed Regulatory Medizintechnik GmbH in Gräfelfing coined by its own executive director Hans Brügemann. The firm Regumed Ltd. markets a therapeutic device comparable to the MORA-gear, called the BICOM-Gerät, which in the words of Hans Brügemann originated """"in collaboration with Dr. Morell"""". 
The two Managing Directors of the Company Regumed Ltd. - Hermione and Hans Brügemann - have been Scientologists for many",0

 This is wrong 
Why is this article called (and stylised) 'WWE Friday Night SmackDown!'? │here 
Is that not the name of the show?   
I guess. I was thinking it should be called 'WWE SmackDown', like WWE Raw (although it's not written in upper case letters, and doesn't say Monday Night, which is now understandable when you consider the name of the show/logo and all). Speaking of which, there is no longer an exclaimation mark when SmackDown is concerned, not in text or logo - so something should definitely be done about that. It also makes articles incoherent when editors stylise it that way. │here 
Not in the logo? OK...    3:16 
The official name is """"WWE Firday Night SmackDown!"""", all you have to do is watch SmackDown to see that.  Spyke 
Then the other article should be called 'WWE RAW'. │here 22:07, 
2 January 2008 (UTC)
It is called """"WWE Raw""""...   
No because """"RAW"""" is only referring to the """"brand"""" of WWE. """"Raw"""" is name of the """"television show"""", like """"Friday Night SmackDown!"""" and """"Extreme Championship Wrestling"""". TaLk /  
The new logo on the show now only says SmackDown, so should the title be changed accordingly? There still seems to be some confusion in WWE sources though, with the website still calling it Friday Night SmackDown!   

The oficial name of Smackdown, as of February 2006 is """"WWE Friday Night Smackdown"""", ther is no loger a """"!"""" in the logo, and you can't tell, by the logo, that you have t the top of the page, becuase it is nearly two years out of date!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.18.2.45

Dr J.H. Kellogg, writing in 1888 in Plain facts for young and old: Embracing the natural history of hygiene and organic life:

In some countries females are also circumcised by removal of the nymphae. The object is the same as that of circumcision in the male.

Sir Richard Burton in the notes to the 2nd edition (1885) The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Nights:

Female circumcision is the proper complement of male circumcision, evening the sensitiveness of the genitories by reducing it equally in both sexes: an uncircumcised woman has the venereal orgasm much sooner and oftener than a circumcised man, and frequent coitus would be injurious to her health.",0

I guess you're doing the same thing as me - working through the Category:Pages with missing references list to correct them.

I don't want to bitch, but it does seem that on more than one occasion you've been too hasty, and committed without checking results.  For instance The Grapes of Wrath (film) - it quite clearly states at the end what the problem was (needed a ) but all you did was insert another  immediately before the one that was there, which didn't cure anything. 

I take this exercise as an opportunity to apply other edits to the article too, if it grabs my fancy.  So in this example (The Grapes of Wrath (film)) the simple solution would be just to do what the error message tells you.  But the longer solution, and probably what the original author wanted, is to remove the group name from the .

I'm also keen on articles having proper citations, which aren't dead, so I often try to clean the citations too.  That usually involves a change from a straight  style to a full-blown  because then I can add a date showing when the link was last checked.  Takes time.

Like I said, I'm not really bitching, but if you don't do it right, then you're wasting your time.    mytime= Thu 11:19, wikitime=",0

The Wallace line demarcates biogeographical continents, which to a large extent coincide with the geological continents. On those grounds, East Timor is not a part of Asia. On the other hand, it seems that geopolitically East Timor is considered a part of Asia.
There are two problems I see with your position.
Firstly, Oceania is a geopolitical continent, not a biogeographic or geological one. From the geopolitical point of view, East Timor is in Asia. From any other point of view, Oceania doesn't exist. Either way, East Timor is not a part of Oceania.
Secondly, reputable sources have been presented, which state straight out that East Timor is in Asia. They may not state their criteria, but they are unambiguous in their position. You, on the other hand, are unable to present any sources, and are relying entirely upon reasoning. I salute your reasoning, but the fact is the sources win. The CIA and the UN are considered more reliable that your good self, no matter how ingenious your rationale.

This user who is now personally attacked me via stalking of articles I edited is now using racism to get back at me. A Biographical article is not only about one acheivement, but ones whole life and that includes ancestry. That abusive user 172.56.11.26 is going to sabotage that article to get back at me, and you're protecting him.  he accused me of """"vandalism"""" when all I did was make the article conform to Biographical standards and moreover to back me up a higher level editor reverted his reversion of my sensible edit. So who is the real vandal ? - Another contention that I ran into was some want to promote Gary's parents ethnicity above his LSR.

 d15b8 - if you want citations, then YOU spend the time finding them. I own several original b8 engines. h0w many d0 y0u 0wn? 

As an American, it is not only my right but also my duty to question immigrants in my country. Swedish nationals (as you claim to be) have 90 days to reside in the United States. What kind of visa -if any- do you have here? Is it a J-1? How long is it valid until? And more importantly, how did you obtain your visa? Are you a tourist? Working here? Were the terms and conditions of you obtaining a US Visa such that you come here and wreak havoc on an American, helping an American website (Wikipedia), by deleting long-time contributors' entries to the D15B8 engine (a US-only engine that foreigners are unfamiliar with)? Everyone else reading this> Swedish immigration control would ask you the same questions if you traveled there. (they did to me).
After over half a decade of edits that have lasted to this day (thankfully most of them undetected by Mr.choppers) it is an atrocity that anyone would label me as a """"vandal"""". (who CARES if I have an """"anonymous"""" IP address!? who has the time to create or maintain a Wiki profile?? Retired folk? ...""""some of us have to work around here"""".)
In fact it is the opposite: one random day, an obnoxious Mr.choppers -a self-deemed WikiHawk- pops up and inappropriately removes/challenges people's edits. Especially my perfect Honda engine edits. When he has no educated backing of any kind. (the dork doesn't even own a car!). His only interest is to pester good and faithful users like myself by dangling long lists of rules in front of people's faces. Mr.choppers -regardless if he has a self-made """"profile"""" or not- has proven himself to be a wrench in the gearbox, a cat on the kitchen counter, and obviously nothing less than a Wiki-loser with too much idle time on his hands.
This is not Sweden. We don't have NoKo Jeans in the U.S.A. Your cold, immutable, silent, and stoic-striving culture doesn't work here. Nor is it welcome. And if you, Mr.choppers (probably with Knäckebröd crumbs stuck in your clothes) changes any one more of my CORRECT and CONSTRUCTIVE contributions to Wikipedia (the d15b8 engine or otherwise) then I'll seek you out. My d15b8-powered car has been to NY before, and coincidentally soon will again. You and you alone will decide if Manhattan Valley will be added to the list of destinations while in New York State. Mr.choppers: you have been warned. Leave my editions alone, or a search for you shall commence.""",0
"What's that Oil for again? ==

It says the main reason for using oil in old large capacitors and transformers is because of the heat generated. Funny, I thought it was used mainly as an insulating medium and dielectric. 

OK, its for cooling as well! 

But not mainly for cooling in capacitors as they shouldnt get very hot (unless thers a lot of ripple current and a high ESR). So I intend to correct this statement. 

Ive posted a dispute tag in this area, because I dont believe in general that oil is used for capacitor cooling.
Quote from manufacturer literature:

'#  Why are GAEP high voltage capacitors oil-filled?
 
Highly insulating oil is used to suppress partial discharges (corona), increase the dielectric strength, and increase the effective permittivity (dielectric constant) of the capacitor dielectric. Oil-filled film capacitors have high energy density in comparison with other types of capacitors used at high voltage, such as ceramic capacitors. Different types of oils are used with different types of capacitor dielectric and electrode designs.

Permanent Resident Alien - An alien admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident. Permanent residents are also commonly referred to as immigrants; however, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) broadly defines an immigrant as any alien in the United States, except one legally admitted under specific nonimmigrant categories (INA section 101(a)(15)). An illegal alien who entered the United States without inspection, for example, would be strictly defined as an immigrant under the INA but is not a permanent resident alien. Lawful permanent residents are legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States. They may be issued immigrant visas by the Department of State overseas or adjusted to permanent resident status by the Department of Homeland Security in the United States.Permanent Resident Alien Definition
Citizenship: The country in which a person is born (and has not renounced or lost citizenship) or naturalized and to which that person owes allegiance and by which he or she is entitled to be protected.

It's also Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday and he gets shafted.

I stand corrected, but it is still 5:3 in favor of Darwin.  
Is your suggestion to put licoln's name twice randomly on main page to make it even? The way i see it both were given importance and there is no reason for them to appear exactly the same number of times. there were featured items available for Darwin, hence they were used. if u have suggestion to improve current items then please provide them rather than complaining about ratio.

 Re: Winans Family 

I fully understand your concerns about the new user but I think if we send him/her a message, they'll understand. I mean, the article is geared towards the musical family...I could understand if Matthew was one of the Winans kids but he's their third cousin or something like that. Honestly, he just isnt pertinent to the article. As for the NPOV statement, the main problem were statements like """"his love and passion is basketball"""" which make it sound more like an advertisement. Granted, this only occured once or twice but nonetheless its there. Also, theres way too much information on him here, more than the actual Winans family are given (granted, many of them have their own pages). Why dont we just make Matthew his own page and then under the trivia section say """"The Winans are cousins of basketball player Matthew Winans"""".

Basic income of $10000 means that you receive $10000 no matter what your other income is.

 revived / remains 

So:
 What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus """"second half of the 20th century"""", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, """"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies"""" or in English """"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades""""). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't """"remain"""" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing """"revived"""" the critical points in 1961.
 Where you perhaps have a point (with """"remains"""") is that Toumanoff's main point, the """"Bagratids argument"""", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).
 I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (""""revived... continue to maintain""""). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.
  
Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.   

Did you actually read Sarkissian's article? He quotes authors from 1920s and 1930s, and says: 

Such was, and to a large extent still is, the traditional view about the life and the work of Moses of Khoren which was accepted by the Armenians. It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.

So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master """,0

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the",0

I also did a bit of work on putting the references in the somewhat odd format that WIkipedia uses.

 as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib) 

 (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)

 So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too? 

 Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: 

  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) 

 Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. 

 And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it. 

 I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? 

 Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. 

 Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:

Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)

 You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.  

 In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""". 

 And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling. Why would you need to state such a thing, if not for the possibility that you might have s",0
You are entirely wrong. And you also seem not to understand how wikipedia works. Wikipedia gives no preference to indigenous communities or the national usage in these cases. Those communities can create wikipedias in their own languages where their preferred usage will prevail. Your disregard for the editor community as a source of consensus is particularly problematic.·snunɐw·,0

 Email haxing 

Some random dude did an article drive by here and got a bee up his butt and decided to start tearing stuff up without even bothering to talk to anybody about it fist or justifying it what so ever.  I don't know if he is trying to white wash the article or is meat puppeting for someone else who's been trying to white wash here in the past.  I just do not know.  But I see the distruction he has caused and I weep.  No, not really.  But it is pretty lame nonetheless.

So why is this stuff in here?  Well some guy haxed her emails and cell phones - just like he did with 50 other celebrities.  He haxed and stole all kinds of extremely sexually explicit photographs.  So now the haxer dude gets caught and the Fed want a 60 year sentence.  But they back down to a 6 yr one.  But, the random haxer dude has got to pay Rene, my sweet, dear, poor Rene over $76,000 in """"restitution.""""  This is for about 20 pics of Rene stuffing a dildo in every hole of her body.

The Feds worked on this case for nearly a year and talked to more than 50 haxing victims.

But you, Mr. Random Dude, by wandering in here on a drive by and white washing, you denigrate Rene's status as an innocent victim here.  You are telling the world that We - Wikipedia - could careless about how you have been so wrongly injured that we are just going to bury the truth like it never happened.

This event was an extremely signifant event for her and her life will never be the same afterwards (or, it won't be the same till she cashes her $76,000 check, eh?).

So, Mr. Random dude white washer, what have you to say to justify your actions?  Oh, and please don't come back with some kind of lame responce like, """"Well, I have been here longer and I am going to throw my Wiki weight around and you got to do what I say because I am King of the Wiki Hill here or I will ban you, etc., etc..""""

A hell of a lot of work went into putting all this stuff together, research, finding sources, making links, and proof reading.  Until some, I've got a job and I have a life.  So this took a lot out of my family time cuz I wanted my first major contribution to look good.  Until Mr. Random Dude came by and screwed it all up.  >:{    """,0

 that section right there. The """"As a result of such dramatic situation ..."""" you make it sound like it was because of Israel the mutual defence agreement was signed. Even in King Hussein's own book and through historical records its pretty clear jordan went to war not because of a threat of israel winning, but a threat that egypt and syria would win sidelining jordan big time.

At any rate i think it would be better not to context why the wars started etc. Focus on battles, etc. Most of the israeli incursions were also due to Israels concept of if Palestinian guerrillas attack to hit back at the arab militaries instead.

It's upsetting for me to see that someone can falsify and deny the existence of true Turkish novelist F. Rifat Ulkuman just for not to get punished because of the vandalism.

Emancipation (1862) was closely tied to growing power of abolitionists as McPherson says:
By the beginning of 1862 the impetus of war had evolved three shifting and overlapping Republican factions on the slavery question. The most dynamic and clearcut faction were the radicals, who accepted the abolitionist argument that emancipation could be achieved by exercise of the belligerent power to confiscate enemy property. On the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves. In the middle were the moderates, led by Lincoln, who shared the radicals' moral aversion to slavery but feared the racial consequences of 
wholesale emancipation. Events during the first half of 1862 pushed 
moderates toward the radical position. One sign of this development was the growing influence of abolitionists. """"Never has there been a time when Abolitionists were as much respected, as at present,"""" rejoiced one of them in December 1861."""" [End quote from page 494  """,0

 Anti-TKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it's a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under """"development of TKD"""", controversies surrounding Karate's influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It's misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under """"traditional roots"""" TKD's foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under """"External Influence"""" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. 

The article is now overstating Taekwondo's relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about """"Subak"""" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon's development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan's influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let's keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student's guide.

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let's leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn't very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800's.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn't mean that those arts weren't passed down or that they didn't exist.    While tkd isn't taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD's origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900's.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn't reflective objective reality behind TKD's conception.

btw.  There's a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800's.   

To keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:

1. We know that """"Subak"""" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don't really know exactly what """"Subak"""" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced """"Shoubo"""") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).
2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don't actually know",0

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group?

I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum.

You asked, """"would you described these as pro-choice advocacy groups""""?  Please observe that my edit to this article said that RCOG took a """"pro-choice position"""" about a particular issue.  That is different from saying that RCOG is a """"pro-choice advocacy group.""""  KillerChihuahua pointed out that difference here.

I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA, though it's not relevant in connection with the present article.  Yes, I would personally view the BMA as a pro-choice advocacy group.  After all, the report to which you refer states that, """"the BMA does not start off from a neutral position in this debate....the BMA has repeatedly since the 1970s agreed [sic] policy statements supporting the Abortion Act ... and calling for the legislation to be extended to Northern Ireland.""""

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.

However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""  RCOG has not only opposed reductions in abortion time limits, but has also sought to """"make abortions easier and faster.""""

Your request for rollback

Hi Jeffrd10.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.

Re: Hughes.  Yes, I think you're right that they were no longer lovers at that time.  But you didn't change """"was her lover"""" to """"had been her lover,"""" you just deleted the entire paragraph, which I dispute.  Instead, I propose:  With the help of Howard Hughes, who at one time had been her lover, she purchased the rights to the play and turned it into a hit movie.  The movie was very important to her career and it's an interesting and pertinent detail that Hughes was so involved in helping her make it a reality.  I certainly don't want to perpetuate errors, but let's talk about how to fix them instead of just deleting information wholesale.

Re: Hepburn and Tracy's living situation  what would you suggest instead?  How about something like... Hepburn and Tracy were undeniably a couple, but only lived together regularly until the last few years of Tracy's life. Even then, they maintained separate homes to keep up appearances.

Re the Hughes/Hepburn engagement  I believe there was a NYT article that announced their engagement, or announced that it was off, but I haven't had time yet to find it.

Re Hepburn and Smith's marriage, from Higham:  The marriage was a disaster. Kate had such a horror of domesticity that the whole experience was a nightmare. She evidently realized that she had married on a whim and that marriage was totally incompatible with her need for absolute freedom of thought and action.  Three weeks after the marriage took place, the couple separated.  Faced with the fact that he had a failed marriage, Luddy sensibly decided to continue with Kate on a platonic basis.  She remained legally married to him for several years.  Do you have something that refutes this?  I'd be glad to source it specifically to Higham in the text of the article if you like.

BAPS activities are not always without controversy, as in its open support of the Sardar Sarovar dam project in Gujarat. For its supporters, the Sardar Sarovar dam and the multi-dam Narmada Valley Development Project of which it is a key component are intended to increase power capacity and provide irrigation, cleaner drinking water, and flood control; for its opponents, the dam is environmentally and socially disastrous and is purchased at the cost of submerging a high percentage of dalit and adivasi villages. The wealthy BAPS organization is criticized by dam opponents for acting to protect its class interests, including those of its land holding members. In response, BAPS followers who are familiar with the Narmada controversy point to the various village relocation and community rehabilitation projects voluntarily instigated and funded by BAPS.

Also the Introduction to Swaminarayan Hindusism book states """"Also the Introduction to Swaminarayan Hindusism book states """"The history of the Akshar Purushottam Sanstha has not been with out controversy and division. In AD 1966 Dadubhai Patel and his....""""

In addition to BAPS's break from the original Swaminarayan satsaṅg, other schisms have occurred. In 1966 a handful of East African BAPS followers broke away and founded the Yogi Divine Society. Additionally, sādhus from the original movement have left to form their own institutions that sometimes (e.g., Swaminarayan Gurukuls) but not always (e.g., Swaminarayan Gadi) retain an affiliation with their gāddī.

Hi Heah, 

Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:

Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.

And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:

The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?

Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13",0

Hmmm, maybe it needs to be made more clear. It is about people withdrawing off of benzos including those totally off of benzos. I thought with it being in the withdrawal section people realise that it was referring to people withdrawing or withdrawn and recovering from benzos. It is not about the risks of mixing benzos and alcohol and enhanced side effects but is talking about replacing one cross tolerant drug with another cross tolerant drug, they work similarly in the brain so basically drinking alcohol is like staying on benzos and worse because alcohol is more toxic.

 Aha! So, it is not about Bessarabia, it is about Soviet demands over Bessarabia. I think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings. If we start from analyzing what the Soviets demanded and see that Romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it, we observe insuficient action from the side of Romania (did not organize a referendum), as well as from the west (did not succeed in overthrowing the Reds - to try is not enough). But also we run into Англия, Франция, Италия, Япония и Румыния подписали в Париже т. н. Бессарабский протокол, согласно которому они признали суверенитет Румынии над Бессарабией, и установили, что этот суверенитет """"не может быть поставлен на обсуждение"""", which obviously ties the hands of Romania: whatever you say, it was much more important for Romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with Russia.
 But I said from early on, that Bessarabia, not Russia is the center of the issue. It is Bessarabians that chose this or that, not Romania or Russia. Russia had intervened only in 1940, without being invited by a local body or by MPs from Bessarabia, without even a mock support from inside Bessarabia. Why should Russia's demand be treated supperior to Bessarabia's choice (good or bad, it was a choice made in full awareness). The (military) treaty you mention was signed in February, i.e. before 27 March 1918 between two neighboring to Bessarabia countries. It can not possibly tie the hands of Bessarabia itself, by then an independent country.
 About autonomy, as far as I know, after the 27 November, resp. 1 December 1918 union of Bukovina, resp. Transylvania, a government was set for the entire united Romania, led by a Transylvanian politician (Alexandru Vaida-Voevod). He was too liberal for the phanariot-minded politicians that used to govern in Bucharest before. They tolerated """"new Romanians"""" in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary. Among other things, Vaida started a large campain of land reform, widely supported also by Bukovinians and Bessarabians, but very feared by the old ruling elite in Bucharest (recall the 1907 peasant uprising, still very fresh in mind). They tollerated Vaida's governments (there were 2 or 3 I think) for ca. 1 year, and in early 1920, a """"black coalition"""" was formed, and General Averescu became prime-minister (similar to the one formed in Romania in early 2006 against Basescu, which lamenably failed within 1 month, but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn). Land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started. The new Constitution of 1923 was written by these people, who put the word """"unitary"""" everywhere they could fit it into. Thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new Constitution. In return that led to a bitter division of the politics: on one side National-Liberal party of Bucharest old politicians, on the other the Transylvanian-dominated National-Ţărănist party. In 1928-1930, the latter started to gain momentum, and to sealed it they brought in Carol II from forced exile. But Carol II turned to be even worse, so they actually shut themselves into leg, so to say. That led some of them to more nationalistic discurse (for example Vaida himself - Dahn even calls him fascist, which is not true, but I don't want to argue with Dahn), others managed to escape this trap (for example Maniu). You see, you have to take into consideration the entire going ons. Bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it, which in turn was because the old phanariot-mineded people carried the day in early 1920s. These people lost the grip on power, but it took time. Even in modern Romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes. On one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy (again, surprisingly many Transylvanians among them), on the other side you have the command-system-minded partly-communist-foprmed bureaucracy, who fear regionalization (again, surprizingly many Oltenians and other likes of them among). But unlike the interbelic period, it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction. Regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable, whether you bring the EU-standard pretext or not. So, my second part of the answer is: if it were not for the Soviet occupation, the rise of fascism, and WWII, we would have had autonomy for Bessarabia (with a powerful local legislative body) by 1950s. Communism only created a pause, things continue to roll today. \talk """,0

Have you actually read WP:NOTCENSORED? If you have, perhaps you could actually explain which part of it is relevant to your argument. You'll also find you've picked completely the wrong person to try that argument on in relation to this particular article, since I made the pages of El Reg in relation to a previous dispute where I was attempting to include well sourced details of Adams' rather colourful past. Naturally you might not have seen that, but a look in the talk page archives would have shown you the nature of the dispute.

There is no attempt to """"censor"""" this information from Wikipedia, it is currently sat in Gerry Adams Sr. without a problem. However there's no direct relevance to this article, since Adams states he has no recollection of being abused and wasn't aware of it until the 1990s. Why would we write about Gerry Sr. on the Liam Adams article, should it ever be created which I doubt will happen in the near future at least. That would be synthesis of the gravest order, attempting to imply a cause-effect link because one case of abuse and another when nobody has said Liam Adams was a victim of abuse by Gerry Sr.

 Troubling aspects of the artiicle as it exists right now 

1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.

2) This is new. It's from Conason: """"Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments."""" Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.

3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: """" She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as """"harmless American citizens"""" [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.""""
Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. 

This quote is also troubling: """"Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing."""" Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:
""""Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.""""

Whady'a say?

(Much more on this section later.)

4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.

5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are """"not as bright"""" as men'?
Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

"Memories of Senator Sam Ervin 

In my late teens, prior to joining the Navy, I had ambitions that exceeded my financial means. I wanted to be a lawyer. 
Fate would provide a different path in my life, but in those days I used to go to the courthouse in Morganton, NC when I had a chancejust to watch the lawyers argue cases. I dreamed about someday being able to present cases like many of them did.
Once in a while, the presiding Judge would stop everything and recognize Senator Ervin, who would show up in the court to watch the proceedings. Once recognized, the Senator would usually stand up and give some folksy, always humorous, anecdotal speech that made everyone smile-even the guilty. Of course, this was usually in traffic or small claims court. 
A lifelong Republican, I have to admit that I retain a great admiration for the intelligence, wit, and the man the Senator Ervin (a Democrat) was.

 Simon Charlton and Sealand national football team  

Four different users have now tried to add the fact that Simon Charlton played for the Sealand national football team to the infobox on his article, citing this article from the BBC. The text does not mention Charlton but I have not watched or listened to the video, so I don't know if he's mentioned. Be that as it may, IMO this was not a serious fixture and should not be added to the infobox. Any thoughts?      
Derek Stillie has had this info added too    
Should be treated like any other """"nation"""" not recognized by FIFA. If those are included, this should be too, as the NF-Board, who seems to be the next official thing, recognized this match. -  
Apparently Mr Charlton captained the side..... In my opinion, any """"governing body"""" that accepts membership from an attention-seeker representing a fort in the sea with a resident population of 3 whose football association advertises for members of the public worldwideto write in and apply to be a second-half substitute in a supposed """"international"""" match under said governing body's control, loses any possible credibility. I hope the ground where the match was played made a few quid behind the bar, but DK has it correct, it's not a serious fixture and shouldn't be in the infobox. A sentence in the prose is fine, but that's all. cheers,   
It was an official NF-Board recognised match. I don't know what that means in terms of notability but looking at players of other NFB """"national"""" teams, there's about a 50-50 split to whether their caps are mentioned in the infobox. Dom 
Regardless of what we normally do with NF-Board countries, I don't have a problem in removing Sealand from the infobox as aspecial case. We are after all talking about a country with no grass or artificial turf, and a population of fewer than 11 people. —WFC—  """,0

All of those statements need to be referenced.  Leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information.  To point out one thing, I'll bring up Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012.

Second, the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that.  It appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link.  It's possible that some came from this as well, I can't tell.  I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences.

Then you went ahead and reversed my deletion in the article without discussing it here. Please get consensus before making any article changes.
 I took a closer look at your source for the """"under 18"""" thing and found a few issues:
 1. It is a paid report costing $30 to access. How can any editor verify that you aren't making bogus claims? 
 2. This article seems to be referring to meditation in general and not Sahaj Marg, so it's not relevant to this discussion - You may want to place it in the meditation article.
 3. It is speaking of the inappropriateness of meditation from a pediatric standpoint (supposedly - I haven't read it). The wiki article on pediatrics says that this science is relevant to children up to 14 to 21 of age. So how is this specifically relevant to the """"18 years of age"""" point under discussion here? If you want to put in a criticism of Sahaj Marg making younger children meditate, don't hide it in an irrelevant footnote. 
 4. Finally, the sentence """"Sahaj Marg guru recommends a minimum age of 18 before beginning the practice of meditation, implying this technique is not suitable for younger people."""" is your extrapolation of the motivations for the SRCM rules, i.e. original research. Not admissible. I will be removing the """"implying this technique is not suitable for younger people"""" part.

"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority.

 Preferred use of Virginia-geo-stub? 

Grutness, please help a clueless newbie...  I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).

I understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).  

However, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?

I'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.

Thanks in advance for filling me in.

 

Thanks for the help, Grutness (at User_talk:JohnPomeranz)

 

 Politician-stubs monitoring 

Hi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.  (talk) 

Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 200 stubs from 6 countries than 700 from 40 nations. My main motivation is to see a consistent system for both the geo-stubs, the politician-stubs, and any other type of stub. So if the ge",0

"""==Should this page be unprotected?==

 Unprotect Augusto Pinochet - See Talk:Augusto Pinochet. Veriverily isn't explaining his objections to text he keeps reverting over and over again.  
The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

Not sure where to put this; the talk page seems to have fragmented, and nothing is in chronological order anymore.  This section looks like as good a place as any.

Just in case you're looking for an outside opinion, analogous to an admin closing an AFD: For reasons unrelated to this content decision, I spent last night looking at this entire talk page (not the archives, thank God).  After reading it all, I figured I might as well put that to some use.  It is my opinion that there is no consensus to add the war crimes information to the article in any form, and that achieving such a consensus is not going to happen at this time, and further discussion is going to amount to going around and around in circles, with no benefit.  Since no consensus for controversial information defaults to """"don't include"""", I think it should not be included, and you should all move on.

I note that """"consensus"""" does not mean unanimity; there is no obligation to discuss this until everyone agrees.  Otherwise, AFD's would last several years.  I cannot imagine any possible compromise wording that would gain a consensus for inclusion.  I actually have no strong opinion on the inclusion itself; just an outside take on how your consensus building is going.

Non-binding, of course, but to be honest, there's a 95% chance that that's what formal mediation would end up telling you anyway.  Accept this, or ignore it, I don't care; just thought you'd like a completely uninvolved opinion.   """,0

There is no """"neutral"""" alternative, and I'm not going to repeat the """"officialness"""" argument yet again. Personally, I think that the UB resembles the St George's Cross too much and that thiswould be a better future alternative for NI, however, Wikipedia can't just start making flags up and must reflect things as they are at present. It is understandable why some may not like the fact that the UB has been displayed prominently by militant loyalism (as outlined in flag articles linked from the NI page), but why should such loyalists be able to hijack the only signifcant flag that has ever represented NI as a region? Many people also don't like the Irish Tricolour either because of it's association with militant Irish Republicanism, but does that mean that militant Irish Republicans should be allowed to hijack the tricolour and we should demand that the tricolour is removed from the Republic of Ireland/Flag of Ireland pages?  22:01, 21""",0

Your campaign for censorship got a strong head start. I dont blame you, as it's the guy below who is adding fuel to the fire. Friends? )  
With this unappologetic response, I think a longer ban is in order.  
Here's the one vying for head of the censorship department lately. Mind your own business a little more, Irpin.  
My dear friend. As it has been ruled by the courts, Freedom of Speech does not extend to protection of ethnic slurs and hate speech whose propagation brought about your ban. Besides, nothing could stop you from using one of your socks. So, you were not really censored. Last but not least, you could take your grievances to your talk page which was not protected. I think Renata was too lenient. But be sure that unless you change your behavior, the next block will be permanent.  

Insinuations and wishful thinking. The almighty King Solomon of Wikipedia, almost. I think people have been too lenient in scrutinizing your smear campaign. This is not Renata's fault, but a consequence of the lack of disciplinary action in your case (long overdue), an institution you so vehemently attack, counting on the ignorant unsuspicion of a few to abuse against other users. Soon, you wont be fooling anyone any longer, Irpin, so watch it (take my good-spirited advice).",0

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Those aren't my words, regarding you. They are Salon's. THEY have identified you as an apoplectic, vengeful disgrace, with an unhealthy scatological fixation. So, that's what we're dealing with here: you, Qworty, as the star of an article entitled """"Wikipedia's Shame.""""

Now, Wikipedia requires that we assume good faith in our fellow editors, which I do, until the most extreme (and frankly comical) evidence points out that we're dealing with someone like you. Since we know that you will do everything within your power to sabotage any entry remotely related to Filipacchi, it's a waste of time to discuss matters of policy with you. I'm happy to debate subtle points of epistemology with almost anyone, into the wee hours of the morning - just not with you.  As for Little green rosetta: I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt. Even though she accused me - on the basis of what she termed """"behavioral and technical evidence"""" - of using sock puppets. Even though, when that proved to be false (okay, a lie), she didn't apologize, but instead came here to support your - Qworty's - frivolous snark. Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

1) I asked you what actual contributions you've made to her articles besides your pointless edits and I constructive edits to the lead? 2) The whole WP:UNDUE is about going with what the majority of critics use instead of a select few. Let's pretend articles are critics shall we? 98% of critics use """"composition"""", 2% use """"content"""". Now by following those guidelines, you would have to use composition? If you want, I have plenty of other users that will agree with me here. Using content might work on relatively unknown articles, but all the articles that millions of people see, and that actually matter, we use composition. 3) That little content section you made was a shitty copy and paste job from compositions that I've created (every single one of them, from pages which I've also written the majority of if not all of them), you didn't even include the others or put a construction banner to show you were still working on it. Also, you divided it from 1-9 and 10-19? What in the world were you thinking? Even for double disk articles we don't do that, articles are treated as a single body of work.

That's not the case with celebrities, athletes or politicians from a city, which I'm unlikely to just run into.

 A friendly note 
Peter,

This is NoC. I am here to try and explain something that I think you've misunderstood. The claim that I was denying peoplehood to Jews is incorrect. Those edits you've noted were, in fact, fighting a particular ANTISEMITIC person. His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting """"is a person of Jewish descent"""" into articles about Jews he did not like. I was not denying Jews peoplehood, I was corecting the fallacy that Judaism is only a genetic ethnicity, which is a lie perpetrated by people like Hitler. Sposer explained it to you exactly as I would have. There are many many Jews who are not decendents of the original Hebrews. There are people who converted, people who were the product of mixed marriages in Europe, etc. They are Jews too. Concentrating on the religion aspect does not deny peoplehood, rather it eliminates the fallacy that Jews are a """"race"""" only. If you would like to discuss further, please ask Fayssal for my e-mail and I will be happy to talk to you. I am doing my best to at least clear up these misconceptions. Best wishes. 75.3.113.9  """,0

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

"Extended comments about this
The comments by BritishWatcher show the problems at present.

I gave him a simple choice, assume good faith and take me at my word, or buy the book. Instead he chose option C, whine and assume bad faith.

He asserts I have not provided an alternate text written from the source instead of the current text. If he had bothered to read the discussion, he would realise I have said more than once that it is not possible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source. So I cannot do that.

The problems are quite simple:

The original sentence which was copied to the lead (complete with egregious modifications of the original sentence to mean something completely different!) did not match the source, and is therefore unsourced.
It is impossible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source.
Various editors have produced no sources at all to support any figures about injuries or opinions they have said should be included in the lead.
Various editors refuse to allow an unsourced (as the text does not match the source in any way) sentence to be removed from the article. They are so insistent on retaining an incorrect, unsourced sentence. Not only that, they keep proposing equally incorrect, unsourced sentences that either cite zero sources or inaccurately cite the existing source.
I have asked many times why the reader should be misled. It is quite telling that nobody dare give me a straight policy based answer to that question, especially when the protection policy allows for its removal.

When one side's discussion involves nothing more than assumptions of bad faith, stalling, stonewalling and making things up from thin air, it is obvious where the problem lies.",0

Agree strongly with BilCat. The comparable list should be there to illustrate what might be in the air at the same time, doing a broadly similar job, on the same side, on the opposing side, or neutral. The facts (hopefully) in those articles should make it clear how comparable planes are, and importantly make it clear to what degree one can really know and to what degree of generality. Incidentally this article just suggests that the F-22 is invincible, which I suspect was the intention. Almost makes me WANT some afghan to shoot one down with a catapulted rock in the fanblades ;).

"Dear Baba: Your words are wise. But I am sorry for not sharing your optimism. I prefer not to have my back to Muslims. My best Muslim friends turned against me once I told them I am out. They were not just ignorant Muslims but doctors and professors. Many of them subtly expressed their desire to see me dead, even though no one actually threatened me. I saw it wise to move to another country and keep my whereabouts guarded. I think I can do without Muslim cooperation and have little need for their friendship. They will stab their best friends in the back. I do not trust their smiles and offers of friendship. That is called Taqiyyah (the art of deception or what they term as “diplomacy”). That is their way to lull you into a false sense of security. Sorry BYT, nothing personal my friend. Once you leave Islam you will understand everything I say and I would love to sit and share our experiences while sipping our cold beers. I played that game of deception too without even thinking about it or being conscious of it. I too got involved into censoring facts about Islam just as Anonymous Editor so zealotry doing here. I wrote articles lying about Islam to present a false image of it, without even thinking this is dishonest. All notions of good and bad faded. All that mattered was da’wa. It was so natural to lie and all seemed so okay. I don’t dislike the Muslim converts here. I feel sympathy for them as I see myself in them. I hope that they too wake up and see the truth.

Hey there buddy, I am back:

(a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd.)

""""the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.""""

Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become """"a very powerful and scary radicalized community"""".  

Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk. If you are drunk, you do not admit it... You're basically shooting yourself in the foot by admitting that you have had a few drinks while fiddling around on wikipedia, (and in some cases, 3 cases???) learn from that pal...""",0

A tag has been placed on Stephen Pizzo, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because it is a very short article providing no content to the reader. Please note that external links, """"See also"""" section, book reference, category tag, template tag, interwiki link, rephrasing of the title, or an attempt to contact the subject of the article don't count as content. Please see Wikipedia:Stub for our minimum information standards for short articles.

 I have been here for a month - Irrelevant.  Especially given lack of productivity.

I.E., even if you are a totally new user, you have not set about improving the encyclopedia, which is the expectation.
 I am innocent - you have made more nonconstructive statements in your brief month as Bookish than is warranted.  Further, you seem to be trolling.
 I am only being targetted since I commented on that deletion article - The block reasons seem to be a.)suspected sockpuppet, b.)non-constructive edits.  Ask yourself, do you think constructive wikipedians want others around who seek attention by writing in such an unprofessional manner.  I actually gave thought to jesting in my response on the very AfD you were reprimanded for.  I don't like being involved in a debate with a person who doesn't help others to understand his position.  Your response could have been acceptable if you had said the version of the page that you voted on is crap because the x y and z claims are so baseless that they must be a joke.  The woman has a www.imdb.com page that is referenced on the page.  It is conceivable that because of its brevity you might have been confused about its veracity and validity.  However, she is noted in the msnbc.com page that you should have seen as referenced.  There is little reason to question whether a Veronica Finn exists meeting the description on the page version you saw.  The only way to improve the encyclopedia on contestable issues is if everyone attempts to enlighten others on why changes should be made.  Saying this page is crap does not help. 

 I apologize if the wrong conclusion has been reached regarding your editorship.  However, I believe it was correct and it is certainly supportable.  I support the original unblock denial.

You can do a """"See also"""" within a footnote to accommodate a note in a note. And you certainly can have expository footnotes that explain the text more. I just read through the article again, and I think it may have gone too far in the whitewash direction: for example, it's ok to say that she clarified her educational background and have a footnote, but the footnote ought to say what was being clarified - this way is too vague and not at all clear that there was some obfuscating going on. Similarly, saying her """"role in a potential Giuliani administration"""" and not saying (even in footnote) what was controversial, I think is misleading.  There may be a few other places too.

I understand what the confusion is about. But for clarity, let's clear this out: These are the contentious edits and their summaries:

 """"That feels like WP:WEASEL""""

 """"Inferred by TBA status""""

 """"To me, this says """"they're on the entry list, but we don't really believe it will happen""""

 """"Same as before""""

Crucially you only went to the talk page after making these edits. These edits were then followed 4 hours and 24 minutes later by three edits to correctly format the footnotes after you were again reverted by User:Twirlypen 2 hours 28 minutes later

 """"If this is going to be done, it should be done like this (need to make two more edits before changes are fully visible""""

Now I have two questions:

1) Can you understand why contributors could consider those first four edits as edit-warring, especially considering those summaries.

2) Why did you not indicate in your edit summary for the last two edits of that contentious set of four that you were reformatting them and thus making consistent with community opinion if that was your goal and why did you remove the content entirely in the first place if you only wanted to reformat?

I still don't think you actually broke WP:3RR because the policy clearly states a series of continuous, uninterrupted edits can be considered to be one revert. I can understand though that this is deemed to be a minor edit war.   """,0

 Shmede 

Shmede, also known as RW, Schememememede or Romeo Whiskey, is a very competitive chap, who tends to frequently cheat at snooker so he can brag to his fellow friends about how good he is at the sport. His most familiar way of doing this involves returning reds to the table that have already been potted. Another canny trick of his is adding more points than he should onto his score, whilst adding less than he should to opponents. He also has a tendency to say he hit a particular ball when it was obvious he did not. At times, Richard can also be mistaken for Nelson Mandela.

He regards himself as a rather specialist aggressive opening batsman when playing cricket, and together with his slow left arm ‘throws’, he is one whack tack and cack cricketer. Richard’s wicket taking ability is particularly admirable, though apart from claiming the wicket of Simon ‘The Don’ Yates, he generally gets creamed all over the park.

Other sports he attempts to play include football, where, over an illustrious playing career, he has inherited a number of enemies, none of which hate him as much as the Sun, as particularly in the summer months, he can be seen rather red as the Sun is attracted to him. Rumour has it, that this sunburn is the reason why his legs contain very little hair.

His attitude throughout all sports is hated by most, as he is accustomed to arguing with most of his fellow players, including ones on his own side!

RW quotes:
Shouts ‘J*ggaboo’ as loud as possible in Rileys
‘Ya scran head’
‘Come back in 5 years’
‘Get a haircut’
'Doooooooooou like smack, doooooooooou like crack, then u will a love my new smack n a crack party bag. It has a smack and a plerrrrrrrrnty of crack. U can a steal ur friends car radio to pay for it' 
'R8 yunes'
'He's done him'
After hitting the wrong ball at snooker 'FOUL?! What you mean foul?! Dint you see I hit the red first, it was so obvious'
'Pre buzz', 'Rich has just sent a nudge', 'Buzz', 'Pre post buzz', 'Post buzz'
'Terina! Chips'
'Costootipoosmesh'
'I did dobin in 12 yesterday......first hole'
(When asked if the bat is knocked in) 'No its not tin' Then asked again... 'No its not tin, probably allumnium or something'
(When wearing velcro trainers) 'Hold this while I tie me shoe laces'
'Tight' followed closely by 'us bramble'
'Half the school fancies me!......just the wrong half'

In conclusion, Shmede can be simply summed up as a towel.

 Shmede and  at Rileys 

Quite frequently, usually by RWs arrangement, a trip to Rileys is organised for a few frames of snooker featuring RW and RB. Originally set for one o'clock, the meet time at 'Brownie's corner' has recently been moved forward to avoid both parties waiting after lunch has been completed. The meet time at present is around 1220. RB often wears what RW describes as 'his lucky top' which features a dragon on the front. RW's lucky chain was removed after he lost nine frames in a row.

To alert RB of his imminent arrival, RW pranks him numerous times along his journey from his home to the corner. These pranks are located at the following points:

When he sets off from his home,
At SPAR, where he picks up his, now accustomed, 'Spearmint Extra',
When he sees 'the corner',
Upon arrival to 'the corner'.

The journey down to Rileys is now via Hollis Lane as a maze has been erected on Horns Bridge Island. Upon arrival, RB picks the usual table 10, table 13 if 10 is not available, whilst RW visits the toilet and orders his Coke with one ice cube, the price of which is extortionate, and a tap water. The reasoning behind the one ice cube is that this is sufficient ice to cool the drink to an enjoyable temperature and yet not dilute the coke enough to affect its taste (noting that the room temperature of Rileys is at least a full three degrees above the standard 20-21 degrees and this hence means that should the generic four ice cubes be placed into the drink, they would melt at a particularly fast rate, diluting the cola even quicker).

Play usually consists of three frames, lasting approximately an hour and a half, although if RB wins the first two frames, RW is more than likely to concede. When pla",0

For very well-known celebrities, the US government archives may have something: a Google image search on """"site:.gov"""" may bring something up.  Also, the search engine on the Archives website (http://www.archives.gov/) may find things that Google doesn't.  For people with military service, the military might have something (Google search on """"site:.mil"""").

For celebrities that were well-known before 1950, there may be newspaper photographs that have fallen out of copyright.  These will be hard to find, but the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/) may have something.

A further option is to contact the celebrity's agent or estate and ask for an image to be released under GFDL, Creative Commons attribution, or Creative Commons sharealike-attribution licenses.

In my opinion, if free-use images can't be found, the second-best choice is a promotional photo: it's an image that is intended to be distributed widely.  Of course, there are exceptions: for albums, singles, and DVDs, a low-resolution scan of the cover is always appropriate.  For movies, a still from a well-known scene or a low-resolution scan of a promotional poster is good.  Failing all else, other fair-use images can be used, but they need to be tagged, justified, have the source/copyright owner credited, and used very sparingly.

As for the images at Iron Maiden, I'm still trying to figure out how strict I should be about fair-use images: all the images there are directly related to the subject of the article (except Image:PrisonerNovel.jpg, which I've just removed), all of them have some semblance of a source indicated, all of them have some semblance of a fair-use justification, and none of them seem to be surplus to the needs of the article.  I should probably push to have the justifications be made more explicit.  """,0

Of course, of course, Pharos, I am familiar with Judaism (I edited to """"Feature Artice"""" the Names of God in Judaism)... The point I am making is that the concept of divinity is very diverse amongst religions. This article is entitled """"List of self-proclaimed deities"""". It is not called List of people that claim or claimed to be God.  My contention is that the article needs to narrow its scope to become useful. For example, in Sikhism, (and Andries is correct in regard of non-idolatry), their gurus are considered to be of divine providence (see the halos behind any Sikh guru portrait...).  For example if we call this article, """"List of people that claim or claimed to be the Creator"""", it will be an appropriate distinction.

Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group, the label, which was under political pressure, released the band from their contract. As McLaren fielded offers from other labels, the band went into the studio for a round of recordings with Goodman, their last with both him and Matlock.

BARBARO

I left some comments on F550's talk page. I think how Wikipedia has treated this F550 and the Barbaro family was unfair. I also noticed that this individual seems to have just tried to edit his name out of those two bogus societies, which seems fair to me, and Wikipedia editors keeps bringing it back. It seems like Wikipedia's disregard for others is very cruel. just my thoughts 

I also left some comments too on genio or ganios talk page too 

 Excuse me Gustav, your contribution with adding San Francesco della Vigna was actually not correct. I left a comment for you on Giano's talk page. I think everyone is desperately trying to piece inconsequential tid-bit in hope that something resembling an article might show up. The original version I saw a month ago was just fine and accurate.

Gustav, I just had a chance to look at the history of the Barbaro family page. Why was the article listed as the """"TRUE BARBARO FAMILY ARTICILE..."""" removed. That is the one that should be the official Barbaro family page. It has excellent Zorzi sources and clearly is structured in a not only a factual way, but also a way that captures the true spirit and soul of the family. This aricle that you have replaced it with is crummy.

Why isn't this page flagged """"under construction"""". You gotta be kidding me if this is the official article that is constructed for the great Barbaro family. Please say it isn't so. This has got to be the worst article I have ever seen on Wikipedia. This thing stinks! Usually articles this dinky are flagged as stubs asking for people to expand on them. I think it is time to admit Gustav that you are out of your league. Clearly the person that constructed the former Barbaro family article was an Art Historian that new this family and proper sources well. 

 
 HYPER-INDIVIDUALIST@YAHOO.COM IS IN ON THE HOAX!  

This hyper guy is in on it with Tiki-two. They planned to damage the Barbaro family page all long. First they started bogus societies which they knew would lead to the family page being destroyed. They planned it well. Tiki used the same company computer which would discredit the family's input and this hyper guy stayed out from editing so he would seem clean. But how come the conversation on the secret society talk page is only between Tiki and Hyper. Even his tag looks suspicious, """"Hyper-individualist"""". Watch this guy very closely. I think the Barbaro family needs an I'm sorry. Because I noticed that whenever it seems like the Barbaro page was going to be restored, than all of a sudden Hyper jumped in with Hoax Hoax! Very sneaky and well timed Hyper. I see what is going on. How can anyone discredit all of the evidence that was given in supportfor the family. I get you Hyper. You were the straight man and Tiki played the opposite role, but you are both as guilty-without any doubt! This guy just magically comes across an ebay purchase out of the blue from ebay back records. Yeah right-Ok Hyper!

"""== History vs. Pre-history etc ==
Hi, as it stands, the first paragraph begins with

  """"The history of Japan probably started around 100,000 BCE""""

I'd like to point out that perhaps it's not useful or accurate to start a history article with a date 100000 BCE like this...  The reason why, in general, is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of 'written records', as the Wikipedia article on """"History"""" will even state.  There can be probably some fudging, because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events.  In short, history and pre-history will be divided by written records.

Please take a look at the wikipedia article on History of England, in that, the upper-right table indicates prehistory is before 43 BC, and history in the years after.  This date of 43 BC is generally due to Roman era records.  And again, (somewhere geographicaly closer to Japan) in the article History of China, the article begins by saying that """"The history of China is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 BC"""". 

I think it's a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100,000 years ago, because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence, then why stop there?  History will blend right into pre-history, and then into archaeology, without any meaningful demarcation.  

There is the more casual usage of the word 'history', of course.  That is, history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end.  In which case, the history of Japan goes back to the Big Bang and all time afterward.  But as an informative and scholarly Wikipedia entry, I think this article should be amended with something more accurate, more specific, referring to what is canonically defined as """"history"""".

I propose something like 

""""The earliest records of Japan date back to 600 B.C.E., according to the Chinese source commonly known as the  Gishiwajinden, or the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms.  In the text, the country of Yamataikoku is mentioned, which was said to be ruled by the Queen Himiko.""""

I think this adds to the quality of the article in its specificity, and in exposing the reader to the Himiko story.  Even here, there is lots of controversy as to whether Yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence.  The idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100,000 BCE, as the word 'history' demands, is somewhat unreasonable.  Any comments?

 Ward Churchill Admits that He is a Lying SOB 

Dear , Ward Churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of TV cameras, last night, February 22, 2005, that he is NOT in fact an Indian.

It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.

The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.

2) Serbia tacitly recognizes Kosovo

3) Serbia establishes border and custom control with Kosovo

4) Serbia does not control Kosovo, defacto nor dejure

5) Serbia recognizes the international subjectivity of Kosovo as an independent sovereign body.
 
6) Most Serb media, like Beta and Fonet, clearly use Nis (Naissus) as a southern town. 

7) Serbia president needs permission of the Republic of Kosovo to visit

8) Serb leaders are now allowed to enter through customs and borders.
 
9) Regions are geographic names, if we use region that definitely, Nis, Novi Pazar should be included because they are both part of Kosovo region, not Serbia. 

10) Territory is when controls, but the inhabitants refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the ruler. Palestine. 

11) Kosovo fulfills all the criteria of a sovereign state, with several UN bodies recognizes it, such as IMF, World Bank and other world institutions. 

12) Serbia willing to establish diplomatic relations with Kosovo if some territory is swapped, obviously, Serbia cares about territory, because it already recognizes Kosovo. 

13) Invalidity of Serb passports to Kosovar citizens. Not even, Kosovar Serbs can travel to EU. So much, about the dispute.

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!""",1

 Some notes 

Hi Amoruso, in regards to your edits on Palestinian refugee and Palestinian exodus, I want to ask you for a favor. While I don't agree that Katz is as neutral a source as you claim, I'm usually not one to advocate censorship on Wikipedia. However, you could do us a huge favor by trying to make your point (i.e. showing your sourced POV that you want to convey) without endless quotes from one rather biased source. The problem I have is that you are bombarding these articles with an endless tirade of anti-Palestinian quotes that, intentionally or not, turn the article into a hate blog. Again, while I admit I don't agree with your analysis as I think its a distortion of history and a sort of dehumanization, I am NOT asking you to remove it. What I am asking is that you make your point concisely, neutrally, (i.e. provide the point of view in a neutral way, if that makes sense), and in an encyclopedic manner. Endless quotes and tirades like that are not encyclopedic material. There are much better, proper, and neutral ways to make your point. Thanks  (talk) 

p.s. I noticed a new article Western Wall Tunnel in which you used a Haaretz article by Akiva Eldar as proof that Arafat 'incited' riots. That article says nothing of the sort, and barely mentions the tunnel incident just in passing as 'evidence' that Arafat was trying to get out of a dead end. It would be helpful to make that small section both accurate and NPOV. Thanks.  (talk) """,0
"I am a little surprised and shocked at the tone of ALoan's follow-up.  This is a very large discussion and it would be quite surprising if I had succeeded in noticing and replying to every single edit by every single participant.  Now that I do see ALoan's request, however, I do not feel motivated to add a further elaboration.  The observation that Ghirlandajo has been inflicting disruptive behavior on Wikipedians for well over a year is well documented elsewhere (and I suspect that ALoan is aware of this because he refers to the application for arbitration).  The observation that Giano's accusations were absurd and extremely damaging is almost a truism and I've cited those accusations enough to establish the point for those who are capable of agreement with it.

 The idea that I was somehow involved in a dispute of some kind with either Ghirlandajo or Giano is something that they have both pushed very hard, so I'm not surprised that there are people who believe this to be the case.  It is, however, untrue.  I was only involved to the extent that any good administrator attempts to maintain order on the wiki and prevent other editors from disrupting it for their own endsin this case, an apparent vendetta and shrieking campaign against other editors.

 I take no satisfaction in Giano's announcement of his departure, but nor am I responsible for it.  He had clearly made up his mind that some of its day-to-day running was in the hands of people of almost indescribably gross moral turpitude, and he did not shrink from stating this opinion at length.  In the circumstances, his departure was inevitable.  Tony Sidaway",0

(Although Newt can be very interesting to listen to in smaller venues, particularly since he left office). And yet both had a high degree of political success - until Bush foundered when the Iraq war turned into a disaster. This goes back to my original point - the policy basis for both parties is more or less the same now as it has been since '92, because at their core the parties are have hardly changed. All that has been altered are details of communication and appeal. The idea that significant change is coming in either party has regularly proven to be untrue - losing elections has not seemed to presage major change.

 The 1960s 

The novel """"Airport"""" by Arthur Hailey (1967) makes reference to a SELCAL system (depicted in the 1970 movie to show the alert about Mrs. Quonsett and then a second alert about D.O. Guerrero), that allows an individual aircraft to be signalled so that a private message can be transmitted without other aircraft being allowed. Is this a precursor to the ACARS system? I assume it used some of the same technology as VHF mobile telephone selective call signalling systems: the aircraft's """"phone number"""" was dialed on a frequency, and the aircraft compared the incoming number to the one in its own memory circuit; if it matched, it signaled with a bell or other such device, and presumably signaled the ground that it was aware of the page.

This is total nonsense I'm afraid. I cannot answer for Wales or Northern Ireland, but Scotland has always had devolved government since it co-founded the Union in 1707. The separate legal and education systems were under the control of devolved administrations. And as time went on there were separate, devolved government departments for just about everything else too, eg Agriculture, Transport, Industry, and of course Health (the NHS has always been devolved, since day 1).

What happened in 1999 is that Scotland re-gained a democratically devolved legislature to control the previously largely unchecked devolved government departments.  """,0

"""

Fowler&fowler; has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment. 
Nichalp says in the present thread """"The term """"British India"""" is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India"""". I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.
On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. 
Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. 
In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  
One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?

Thank you. My problem was with labeling Achilles a """"sexual predator."""" Presumably Sommerstein will go on to identifying Daedaluas as the first aviator and Andromache as the first feminist. Without in any way denying the existence of sexual predation then and now, this particular use of the phrase strikes me as homophobic. It raises the question, which other (nonmurderous) sexual predators he is thinking of? Solon? Socrates? Aeschines? I can only view it as a homophobic remark directed at the Greeks in general. If so, that raises questions about the propriety of repeating it here.

To add to that, what information do we have on the respective ages of the two? Am I mistaken or was Troilus described as a boupais? It has been a while since I studied the topic, but I seem to recall he was nineteen when he died, one year short of the magic twenty needed to save Troy. Achilles, on the other hand, was sixteen when he shed his female garb and left with Oedipus to join the battle, I believe. And the killing is said to have happened early in the war. So what can Sommerstein be editorializing about? An adolescent preying upon an adult?

On a separate note, I never saw anything claiming that Achilles fell in love with Polyxena at the same time as with Troilus. Everything points to his lying in wait at the Lion fountain expressly to get the boy, not the girl (though it may be significant that she was sacrificed by the Greeks at his tomb).

One more thing - when the brothers (which ones?) of Troilus ride - too late - to his rescue, Achilles meets them in Apollo's temple with an unusual weapon: Troilus' head, which he is swinging around by the hair. It is such a gory detail, it would be a pity to not include it, I just no longer have the sources.  """,0

Hi. I  undid your changes to holomorphic function since converting html to LaTeX produces PNG images, which are undesirable. Per the math style manual, html is allowed (and sometimes preferred) in math formulas, and as such, converting them to LaTeX is not necessary.

Comments

I liked it.  Rare is an article which is not only well documented but also interesting.  

I'm a stickler for comma use, so I went ahead and fixed three small errant commas in the article.

As to content, I would raise only two points.  At note 64, you say something like this: """"There was an attempt to assassinate the king.""""  Rather than saying """"There was . . .,"""" I think a better phrasing would be to use the actor as the subject and an action verb.  That is, """"A group of landowners attempted to kill the king.""""  Is it known who was behind the attempt?  

Second, I see that some other people have commented about one-sentence paragraphs.  I wonder if a correction of that did not produce the paragraph at note 71.  that paragraph begins with the topic sentence saying that brewing was becoming popular in the area.  Then, the whole rest of the paragraph has to do with witch trials.  Were those things linked in some way?  Perhaps cut the first sentence free again and add a follow up line about the volumes of beer that were being brewed or something.

I hope these comments are not too pedantic.  I'm new to peer reviewing anything.  Also, I am totally in the dark about formatting for notes, so I've not even attempted to weigh in on those.""",0

I don't think that my statement was """"uncivil,"""" but that is your opinion, which you are entitled to. Like most on-line conversations, words can be misconstrued when the recipient of those words can not hear the tone and inflection of which they are stated, or in this case, the intent with which they were written. You are wrong to think and assume that my sentiments are “uncivil.” I was merely trying to point out that this individual who is not, in fact, a resident of Garden City is not an authority of the village. I do not claim to  know every minute detail of the history of Garden City, however, being a life-long resident, there is a certain level of familiarity that I have that this other individual does not, and could never have.  Unlike those of us who do live here, how can he discredit the statements that residents make? Upholding copyright laws is one thing, but to question the validity of our villages traditions and folklore is something that must be chastised. Read the published books about Garden City, talk to our village historian, maybe even pay a visit to the Garden City Historical society if it is that important to comment on and edit this article.

 Question concering RFA votes 

As you have not answered my question that I asked you on Download's RFA, and before you show me that subpage, I already read it, so there is no need.  Secondly, do not quote policy on me and evade, simply answer the questions, please.

 1.How many more active admins do we have now then we did at the time you nominated Child of Midnight for adminship?
I nominated him because he asked for it. I probably would have opposed if he actually accepted it, but he didn't. I do not care about active/inactive admins. I am only concerned with good/bad admins. Remove all the bad admins, and then start nominating good admins.  
 2.Please explain your ideal active admin-to-article ratio.
The number of admins is fine, there are just too many bad admins that hurt the project more than they help it. Again, there could be 20,000 admins, and I would be fine with that, but there must be no BAD admin. If all 20,000 were active or inactive I wouldn't care, as long as they were good and followed policy. The current 1000+ has many bad administrators, this is why there are too many. I would be fine with 500 or 5000 admins, as long as they are all good. As soon as an admin blocks some maliciously, or deletes something that wasn't within policy - he should be desysoped by policy without a vote.  
I've always seen you vote in oppose, and while you are indeed entitled to your own opinion, I would like to understand what you view as a good admin / bad admin. I find it hard to believe one should assume bad faith in that all potential admin candidates  are considered bad. Could you please explain your criteria for what makes a good admin in your opinion?  
I also wish to still know what your desired admin-to-article ratio is, and why, if you think an admin is bad, don't you just say that, instead of answering with .— dαlus Contribs 

That is all, since you put great thought into your votes, I'm pretty sure you should be able to answer these questions with absolutely no problem what-so-ever.  Than you for your time.— dαlus Contribs 

 Something to take note of 

Hi DougsTech. I just wanted to make you aware of a bit of information regarding your RfA voting pattern. In the past you have claimed multiple times that you're not violating any policies/guidelines with your RfA votes, but you seem to be in violation of WP:AGF. You are obviously not assuming good faith when you oppose every admin hopeful you see. If you think someone will be a bad admin, you need to provide a reason specific to that candidate, otherwise you're assuming bad faith, which is contradictory to the principles on which Wikipedia was founded and on which it still operates. meh!(review me) 
No, he's not.   
Someone else can has already found their flaw, and the other that oppose the candidate give reasons why he/she is a bad admin.   
That doesn't excuse you not to give a reason though. — (talk • contribs) 
Hey I've got an idea! Start a thread about this at WT:RFA. Otherwise, accept that he has his reasons, they are good and have been thoroughly explained multiple times. Stop harassing him over it.

Article issues
This article has some issues that need to be addressed. The first is that of notability. As it is now, the article fails to establish any notability. It is merely a plot summary and, as was explained numerous times at Talk:List of NCIS episodes, Wikipedia is not for plot summaries. It is likely that each individual episode of a television series will not be notable on its own. As per WP:PLOT, """"a concise plot summary is appropriate as part of the larger coverage of a fictional work"""", but on its own the plot does not establish notability. As it says in the {{notability}} tag that kepps getting removed, notability needs to be established by adding reliable, secondary sources. At the moment, there are none. More on this later.

The plot summary in this article is not concise by any means. It needs to be pruned and appropriate information concerning """"the reception, impact, and significance"""" of the episode must be added.

A third issue is that of references. I've already mentioned that reliable, secondary sources do not exist in the article. Of the two references that do exist in the article, one is a primary source. The other (cbsncis.wetpaint.com) is a fan wiki that anyone can edit and so it is not a reliable source. Open wikis such as cbsncis.wetpaint.com are questionable, self-published sources and are generally not acceptable. The expansion of this article will require much better sources.   """,0
"""NatureBoyMD, Macman202, Tony Fox:

I have considered your disrespectful comments towards my Scholarly Review article and, now that the Christmas holidays are over, I am obliged to let my anger with your remarks be known. I shall start with you, NatureBoyMD. NatureBoyMD, you reffered to my article as dubious. This is ironic, considering that you as a person are quite dubious. When I read your opinions of my article, I scoff at you. Your argument is so ill founded that I cannot even take you seriously. It is quite obvious to me, and all the memembers of the SGAS, that your dissatisfaction with the page citations is not an indication of the article's """"dubiousness"""", but rather an indication of your ignorance of Goosebumps and literature in general. If you think people need a citation as to where the camera in Say Cheese and Die came from,, then you need to understand what is common knowledge and not. For instance, If i were to write that the sky is blue, of that the earth is round, or that MACman202 has no idea what he is talking about, most reasonably intelligent humans would agree with such widely known facts. Such is the same for Goosebumps and R.L. Stine. When I say that the plots """"are masterfully formulated"""" or imply that R.L. Stine is brilliant, the majority of people recognize that the two statements are widely known facts. 
As for you MACman202, any notion what so ever that you have the ability to recognize fine literature """"has to be one of the most laughable things I have ever heard"""" (NatureBoy, I included quotations in the last quote so that you, always one to want a citation for the obvious, will know that I quote this MACman202 himself). MacMan, it is quite bold of you to assume that there is so scholar behind my article. Perhaps you should stick to editing the Simon and Garfunkel page on wikipedia. I am sure you are quite familiar with it already.
Tony Fox, you and NatureBoyMD seem to be on the  same page as far as your inability to recognize common knowledge is concerned. To me it seems that you label anything you do not agree with as a """"peacock term."""" I find this most repulsive, as I, like most free thinking, intelligent people believe that speech should not be censored because someone does not agree with it. You can take comfort in the fact that you are not the only one guilty of this unjust censorhip. MACman202 and NatureBoy are just as guilty. Each of you should devote, as I have, your mind to understanding the beauty and brilliance of Goosebumps. When you feel that you have researched Goosebumps as much as I have (it is very unlikely that you ever will) then you may suggest alterations to my scholarly review. Until then, your comments are not welcome, and they certainly will not be tolerated any longer.

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

 Anti-Love Song 

I moved your information from the talk page to the main article. It looks shorter now, but I kept everything. The main reason it is shorter is because phrases like """"from Raven-Symone's fourth album, Raven-Symone"""" just become """"from the album"""".

This is the right way to handle singles that never charted. They don't get an individual article, but there's nothing at all wrong  with putting the infobox and description in the album article.

We haven't been working well together, but I'd like to try and change that. I can see that you are an editor that wants to do things right. Unfortunately, part of doing things right is to not create articles that fail guidelines. The guidelines for article creation on singles are at WP:NSONGS, which I kept pointing at every time I redirected one of these articles or nominated it for deletion.

Edit war

Some notes for those who fear the truth:
A book by fr. Gino Conti was wiped out for the second time.
Another censorship (fr. Pezzi dismissed by Comboni missionaries). Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc.
The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc).
The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says """"I acknowledge the Way"""" but these words are preceded by """"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me"""".
The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way.
Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005.
There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way.
""""Factoid"""" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967.
The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest """"We're Approved"""" Neocatechumenal propaganda.
Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a """"Neocatechumenal spin"""" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin.
Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for """"granting a period of two years"""", but Benedict XVI decisions about that """"widespread manner"""" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not.
""""Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one"""": this valuable sentence tries to """"explain"""" in Neocatechumenalspeak the """"decision of the Holy Father"""" to require homily only from deacons and priests.
On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary).
The """"NPOV"""" tag was the last resort of some Neocatechumenal people fearing the truth.
Please stop this ugly """"edit war"""". Wiping out documented sources won't change the facts.

 Secrets from the grave 

This is pure speculation on my part, but I imagine the exhumation of Paula's grave would have been carried out under conditions of great secrecy and with some degree of security. Nonetheless, I wonder if DNA obtained from any remains might yield a clue as to the identity of the grandfather she shared with her infamous brother. Would anyone be interested enough to do the research? It would surely be only of academic interest, but even so...

I also find it a rather odd co-incidence that these mysterious documents have appeared, apparently within weeks of the exhumation. Is there any proof that the documents are genuine? I still recall the fiasco of the so called """"Hitler diaries"""" some years ago. Perhaps the time has come to stop looking. The subject's fascination cannot be denied, but it is surely time to move forward. TCH. UK.""",0
"""

My overview

1. Intro: Euskadi ta Askatasuna is translated as Basque Homeland and Freedom, yet Euskadi (a neologism) is surely better translated as Basque Country, in the territorial and political sense of the term """"country"""". The term homeland is kind of totally out of place, as happens in some other article. There's no real equivalent for homeland in Basque or Spanish and sounds very strange. 

2. Aims: Mountolive seemed to insist in claiming (erroneously) that ETA's principal aim is to create a socialist state. This is not real, has been discussed before and can be documented. The current status is ok.

3. Secondary tactical targets: 
Drug traffickers (this has a """"citation needed"""" mark). I can't provide the citation but can say that in the early 80s it was the case. 
I would like a source for the Leitzaran highway, a more recent case, that I think is not so clear though. 
Possibly the complex struggle of Lemoiz nuclear plant needs its own article but well... there are no doubts that at some point ETA took it as their own circustantial fight and actually were decissive in stopping its construction. This may well justify a section of its own for this particular case but a separate article is maybe a better solution.

4. Context: the entry is ok as for now, unless someone has a better idea. There was a minor dispute about wether Askatasuna (former GG.AA./AAT) should be defined as """"anti-repressive"""" or just stated without any explanation. 

5. Social support is a little confuse and maybe POV. There's much emphasis on Francoism, what is surely justified, but the division Navarre+Araba vs. Guipuscoa+Biscay is interpreted from the Francoist POV more or less. After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa """"traitor provinces"""" but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. 

The last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It's not clear what erosion may have suffered """"MLNV"""" (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. 

The claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.

6. Tactics: I reviewed this part and mostly is ok. There's the problem of redundancy between tactics and victims and it seems Mountolive had a different approach, that has been partly discussed above.

7. Government response: the treatment of unionist paramilitary groups is too focused on the GAL ignoring once important GCE and BVE) and I'd like to see some material on the following:
Dispersion of ETA prisioners, history of it and its effects on militant prisioners and their relatives and friends (at least a mention to all those dead in car accidents while travelling to visit their imprisioned relatives). 
Recent legal and judicial steps on practical life terms
General replacement of Spanish police corps by Basque Ertzantza (in the BAC) and its influence.

The rest is ok, I think, though maybe the 18/98 procedure and the derivated ones need an article for themselves. I'd like also more info on the closed newspapers, radios and magazines, tortures to journalists of Egunkaria ([http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10179 reporters sans frontiers 2004 report). 

I think you can retire """"controversial"""" from Garzón - though I insist that he's actually quite controversial in fact, I admit it may break WP:NPOV.

8. Structure: it's difficult to expand due to the secretivity of the organization but some comments:
- talde means literally """"group"""" but it would be best translated as cell or commando. 
- I see no r",0
"The article, English phonology, has no explanation.",0

I'm a bit confused by this closure.

How much less notable does a subject have to be to get deleted than the existence of no sources beyond a single student paper from India?",0

"""=Removal from Anti-Semetic category===
Mel Gibson is Only Human
While Mr. Gibson did make wrong, anti-semetic comments, he did so drunk, and he does not speak openly about any kind of anti-semetic views when sober. He also does not advocate his views or pursues them past a drunken rant. I think he needs to be removed from wikipedia's Anti-Semetic category. What do you guys think.
 

He's an adult. The law doesn't make a distinction betwen words & acts said and committed when drunk and when sober; neither should we. He is quoted on a police report as making remarks that are undeniably anti semitic. Therefore, he is anti-semitic.  
Like all material here, just provide sources saying that Gibson is anti-semetic and you can add it in. Thanks 
Umm, the NYT quotes him as making comments about the """"fucking jews"""". Is this not a sufficient source for you?  
In which case, this little ditty from the article also seems to help...a prominent jewish leader calling him an anti-semite: In response, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, who was one of The Passion'''s most vocal critics, released a statement saying that Gibson's apology was """"unremorseful and insufficient"""" and that the group hoped that """"Hollywood now would realize the bigot in their midst and that they will distance themselves from this anti-Semite."""" 
Gibson said that he has disgraced himself and his family and he is sorry for what he did. What more do does Foxman want? Yes, and hollywood has such high standards to hold up...this is the kind of ammunition Foxman craved as soon as he started criticizing the Passion. I'm not anti-semetic in anyway, and Gibson SHOULD be ashamed. I just don't like people being unfair. I also think the mugshot is unfair and I will be changing it. 
I agree that the mugshot may be unfair as a primary image for this article. but it should be included near the discussion of this incident.  

The ADL has been sued for defamation for unfairly accusing people of anti-Semitism before and has been mired in a number of controversies. I would hardly consider them a reliable source.  
Yeah, like George Bush might get drunk and suddenly shout out """"I love Islam!"""" because when you're drunk you typically say the opposite of what you believe?  

It's funny to read the arguments here about if Mr. Gibson is anti-Semitic or not given the known views of his """"Traditionalist"""" Catholic church. Clearly he is anti-Semitic, and in another time, he would probably say so """"proudly"""". Call a spade a spade, if it quacks, it’s a duck. Mel Gibson is anti-Semitic. Can there really be any question among intelligent people? And if this is so, than clearly it has a place in the article.  
Please don't insult us with your damned sneering arrogance, Jake B.  Or some of us may argue that there is no question amongst """"intelligent people"""" that many Israelis and right-leaning Jews amongst the diaspora are racists and gentile haters who campaign in a McCarthyist style (just look at the reaction to this case - utterly hysterical).  I tell you what: I can provide more evidence to support my assertion than you can to support yours (cf ADL). And by the way, according to the ADL every single gentile in the world who isn't an Israel supporter is a Jew hater and racist who should be condemned and ostracised, so quoting one of the leaders is like quoting Hitler in an article on Jews.  Many gentiles see the ADL as nasty, racist and very dangerous.  And by the way, compare Gibson's comments with some of those posted by Jews on the Ha'aretz online forums: he's positively liberal compared to them (I quote from recent posts:  .....99.99% of Arabs are terrorists [does this one sound familiar?].....let's just nuke them all and stop wasting our soldiers' lives.....you can't trust Muslims to hold to peace.....Mel Gibson is a Nazi.....''etc etc ad infinitum, plus hundreds of comments saying the civilians of the Qana massacre got what they deserved.

 Ezra Yakhin (elkanam) of the Lehi, who participated in the fighting, says: """"at the beggining of the battle the women of the village joined the men who were also masking themselves as women, which gave a difficulty at seperating the fighting population with those who are not fighters""""

Are the Greek ,Russian and Coptic Orthodox Churches protestant?They have only been geographically separated and developed that way . They maintain many sacraments seen in the Catholic Church. Also Christian coalitions have core requirements like acceptance of the Divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, Holy Trinity, Ressurection and Salvation through grace, personal relation to J.C. etc. Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, etc, don't accept all of these. Even the Catholic Church accepts (I believe) certain groups as Christian even if they don't recognize the Pope as long as the fulfill these Christian requirements.

 Yet another miscomprehension

In fact, everyone disagrees. Northernmost Fennoscandia may have been inhabitated by the way described by Art Dominique/Steve Wondering, but most of Finland gained its population from the southeast and south. This is what is widely accepted. It would be silly to provide """"exact source information"""", as any book dealing with Finnish prehistory will tell you this. For starters, check out the book Pohjan poluilla. Suomalaisten juuret nykytutkimuksen valossa (publ. 1999), especially the papers written by Milton Nunez and Christian Carpelan.  

The idea that the Stone Age antiquities in Northernmost Fennoscandia could or should be associated with the Kvens is patently absurd, and not endorsed by any archaeologist I am aware of.

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there",0

 Explanation 

Dear EDJohnston and Bearian, I am not here to harm any one or to put any unnecessary information in Wikipedia pages.
Here in UST Global wikipedia page I update the latest information regarding UST Gloabal so that wikipedia users get the right information under right category.

1) Under Corporate Milestones: Company achievements needs to be listed.
2) The link http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931 may have the recent major information about UST Global, but the top part of the page that mentions about """"Key Executives"""" is totally wrong. Two people and their postions who are not part of UST Global is being mentioned here.
3) UST Global is a Company where in past there may have a lot of people who were part of this company in key roles/posts (during their asscociation with the company their names may have been part of this Company related records), but once they left this company searching for other oppurtunities i dont understand why they want to mention their name associated with UST Global. This is like self advertisement which is totally against wikipedia policy

Please advice me if i am wrong in my understanding.

Thank you,

Hi, I just wanted to say great work on List of United States counties and county-equivalents. That's something that WP has needed for a long time, and thank you for your excellent effort on it.

 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

Thanks for that tip. Yes, I will learn how to use it, since everything I do uses math - I mean when I am not fighting off rabid currs nipping at my cuffs. Can one put pictures and sound in as well?

Yes, back to Uncle Ed. There are matters of general policy here:

1. Defamatory words like """"crank"""", """"kook"""", """"crackpot"""" should be banned by Wikipedia as they are literally used in the commission of hate crimes against dissident minorities. They EMOTIONALLY mean the same as """"Kike"""", """"Nigger"""", """"FAGGOT"""" et-al. I and others like Nobel Prize winner Brian Josephson are persecuted for daring to write about the paranormal, about consciousness, about UFOS, about cold fusion (Brian's interest). We are automatically stereotyped as """"kooks"""" by clueless fearful generally intellectual inferiors who mistake their inability to understand what is on the page as our fault. Rather than they rising to us, we are to stoop to their low level of achievement and keep away from Taboo Topics. Is that a Free Society? How is that better than 7th Century Talabanism? We dissident physicists and there are many in the closet are treated as second-class citizens without the same rights that the majority like CH pretends to stand for keep for themselves in a double standard.
One can say """"Jack Sarfatti's ideas are highly original and advanced and not easily understood by the majority of people who reject them."""" Something like that is accurate. If one says something negative then they must justify it with a precise quote with a name otherwise it is simply vicious defamation. It is simply a hate crime on the WEB. We live in a SYMBOLIC INFO NATION in CYBERSPACE. Words are everything. WORDS are WEAPONS! Soon Internet Law will evolve and the kinds of defamations of my character seen on these pages by dillettantes will be judged as HATE CRIMES like beating up a Gay Man or lynching a Black Man used to be.  How can anyone reading my words, looking at my math, so insult me as to call me a such words as """"crank"""". Why not say what you really mean deep down which is """"Jack Sarfatti is a Jew""""? Do I sound like Shylock in The Merchant of Venice?

2. Flaky internet sources like Alt.Kooks, Crank.Dot.Net should not be cited to debase and humiliate anyone deemed worthy enough to have a page in Wiki. They are cultural PORNOGRAPHY of no redeeming social value.

3. Critiques should be COMPETENT, as DSiegel's is not when he cites Martin Gardner. A solid TEXTUAL justification is required like one must do as a grad student learning to do PhD research.

The basic issue here is QUALITY CONTROL, ACCURACY, FAIRNESS, JUSTICE.

Sorry, but just because it may reflect negatively on Donna Hughes does not in itself make mention of the incident POV. The sourced articles clearly state that negative attention was brought to Megan Andelloux and the CSPH through the efforts of Donna Hughes. A zoning battle over the CSPH immediately followed, and the zoning issues may or may not have had their own merits. The degree to which Donna Hughes emails and negative publicity played a role is a matter of argument, and I have be quite careful to preface the statement with """"Supporters of Andelloux claim...""""

In academics, it is quite well known that ALL writing is biased, and reflects personal characteristics of the one doing the writing. For Samuel to make such an argument here is out of line. He has no justifiable grounds to do so. Therefore, you must conclude that this is a personal attack on Olaf's character and his actions!",0
"I completely agree with you, we cannot expect aliens to interpret pictures, movies, sound and text the way we do. Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you. It will take them years to analyze what we have sent them and make sense of it (ie: convert it to something they can relate to), but if they feel as lonely as us, then I trust that they will invest the resources and time.",0

I also support to move to the philosophy page. I would comment further, but Yworo has said pretty much everything. The statistics are wrong due to the redirect forcing users to go to the operating system first; and the operating system (along with everything else on the disambig. page were named after the philosophy. While the OS may be the primary topic for north american and european users, you cannot say the same thing for the people of asia or africa or anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, Yworo is correct. Wikipedia's guidelines aren't written in stone. Read WP:BURO and WP:BATTLE. In Canada, the Supreme Court ruled in one case that the laws of Canada (or any nation) aren't black-and-white, but rather a series a guidelines for which to abide by, leaving room for interpretation and circumstance.

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

 A refutation of User:Lord Loxley 

As soon as my ban expires, I shall revert the English people page to that which had been agreed by a consensus of editors, though I hope that someone else does so sooner. In the meantime, I shall attempt to address each of the issues raised by User:Lord Loxley's in his """"revisions"""".

In the """"related ethnic groups"""" section you have included Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, but excluded Welsh. This makes no sense, and it had been agreed by all editors that the Welsh are among the closest ethnic groups to the English, as anyone familiar with those two peoples knows. Your argument appears to be that the Welsh should not be included because they are English - as a result of the 1536 legislation that annexed Wales to the English kingdom. I can only assume that you have no idea what ethnicity actually means, and I suggest you read the article about it. In short, ethnicity has nothing whatsoever to do with legislation, and the mere annexation of Wales to England did not extinguish Welsh ethnic identity. But you don't need to take my word for it, just look at the Welsh people page. And nor, incidentally, is ethnicity dependent on race or genetics. You have accused me of being a racist, but it is you who are the racist by insisting that ethnicity is defined by race. As for Danes and Norwegians, their inclusion is arguable (though not so much the Swedes - very few of them settled in England). The agreed consensus prior to your unilateral intervention was that no Continental ethnic groups would be included, on the grounds that the inhabitants of the British Isles are much, much closer to each other in terms of culture, history, and language than any groups from mainland Europe. Again, this fact is obvious to anyone who knows them. As a Canadian, it is possible that you may have been ignorant of this. If you are not familiar with a subject, it is probably a good idea not to make edits to its page.

Further down the article you have inserted a sentence saying that the Tudors are the chief representative of the English kingdom. This is not only false, it is also completely irrelevant.

Still further down you have completely mangled the section dealing with the Norman Conquest and its effects. You have deliberately suppressed the historical fact that the English became a conquered nation, and inserted irrelevant descriptions of coats of arms. You then suddenly lurch into a (false) description of Neolithic Britain and Gaul, as if this was in any way relevant to the Norman Conquest. You then mention the Roman Empire and one of its short-lived breakaway states, jumping straight to Offa and Charlemagne, desperate to clutch at any sort of straw that will lend support, however flimsy, to your own preconceived notion that no distinction should be made between the English and the French (despite the obvious fact that these two peoples have a very different language, culture, and ethnic identity). Your mention of the consolidation of kingdoms around capitals such as Winchester and Paris is also completely irrelevant, and your suggestion that the English Channel has been the main focus of English cultural development is demonstrably wrong - the North Sea has been just as important, usually more so.

Moving further down still, you have inserted a whole new section entitled """"Royalty"""", and it is here that you expose the full extent of your total misunderstanding of (a) what the article is about, and (b) the English people. English identity is not based on coats of arms as symbols. If you want evidence of this, look at the World Cup, being played in Germany as we speak. The English fans, almost to a man, carry the flag of St. George, and only very rarely the Union Jack. They never, ever carry the royal coat of arms in any form. Being Canadian, I suspect that you have received a rather distorted view of the English through Holywood depictions and the like. The vast majority of English people would laugh in the face of the sort of mediavalist aristocratic fantasy that you are espousing. You then go on to claim that all Englishmen are actually descended from royalty! This is patent nonsense, and once again exposes your own royalist fantasies. The medieval French-speaking monarchy deliberately did not interbreed with its English-speaking subjects. Now, I'm not saying that no genetic material from earlier monarchs exists in the modern English population, but that is not the point. Statistically, every single person on earth might be descended from Julius Caesar, or anyone else you care to name who lived long enough ago. Oh, and French is most definitely not a lingua franca used among Englishmen - we don't need one, because we've already got English. Indeed, English people in general have been notoriously bad at learning foreign languages. And all that guff ab",0

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

 Hue and Cry 

Hello, Greg. A belated, but warm welcome to Wikipedia.

Can I ask three impertinent questions of you.  Firstly, I am assuming you are the real Greg Kane, in which case, have you found Linda yet ? An old joke, I know, but anything to break the ice. Frippery aside, could I point out COI for your information and enlightenment - it is part of Wikipedia's guidelines and protocols, that you need to be aware of.  Secondly, if you are not the actual 'Mr Kane', then your user name may be fall foul of Wikipedia:Username policy - see the sections under the headings 'appropriate usernames' and 'real names'. Actually, I really am Derek R Bullamore for what it's worth. Thirdly, having now put you completely on your guard, I am assuming that you may have access to some decent sources (press clippings, promo items, concert fliers, whatever) that might help greatly improve the present articles on Hue and Cry, Greg Kane and Pat Kane. If so, are you generally willing to share some of that information here ?

I appreciate this is a bit of a heavy, full barrelled, opener from me. Do you now just crave some """"Sweet Invisibility"""" ?  Best wishes,

You are mistaken. The Johnson School is no different than the departments in the Arts College or the Engineering School. PhD students enroll in the Graduate School and pick a """"field,"""" which roughly correspond to the various academic departments (e.g., Chemistry, Management, Mechanical Engineering.)  The Johnson School is not acredited to grant PhD degrees.  I still think that the article is POV because its history and alumni list give short-shrift to the Public Administration and Health Care Administration aspect of the school. For most of the school existence, these were perhaps its most distinguished programs.  The idea of reassigning notable alumni from the school where they graduated to a different school based on subsequent reorganizations is troubling.  I think we should just have  the list of notable alumni in the main Cornell Univrersity article and the List of Cornell University people.  In some cases, there is no modern equivalent to the program which granted a particular degree and in other cases we may not know the school.  Does it matter that Ed Marinaro was a Hotel School graduate when he is notable as a football player and actor and never entered the hotel industry?  Does it matter that Keith Olbermann went to the Ag School and is therefore presumptively less credible than Ann Coulter?

""": I would just add that unless a stub is clearly vanity or garbage, adding a VfD within minutes after the entry is posted is not a very good practice for several reasons.  While schools are inherently controversial here at Wikipedia, I would urge you to apply the same wait-and-see approach across the board. The whole purpose of a stub is to act as an invitation to create an article.  Frequently, it is difficult to tell whether the subject is encyclopedic.  I have seen many good articles start as stubs.  For example, a stub may start as """"John Q. Unknown was an American politician"""" and it may turn out that he was a Territorial governor, U.S. Senator and later president of a well known college.  Unless the subject of a stub is very well known, it is a rare stub that gives enough detail to know immediately whether the subject has the potential to become encylcopedic.
 You may have already seen these, but I would refer you to Wikipedia:Stub and Wikipedia:Deletion policy. The deletion policy states that among the problems which do not require deletion are a stub with potential (which should be expanded) or a minor branch of a subject that doesn't deserve its own article (which should be merged, with a redirect to the new location).

Hi there. Not wanting to start a war over this. This stub is very vague and I was attempting to add some clarity to it. Because it now reads: """"martyred"""" and """"mostly Roman Catholics and Chinese"""" and it is not a neutral point of view. """"...other churches recognized their own martyrs"""" implies that the others who were killed for their faith were not part of """"THE Chines Martyrs"""". The fact that they are accepted as """"martyrs"""" by the Roman church does not make them """"martyrs"""" in the Orthodox or even the Protestant sense. So, since the meager content of this stub is mostly about the Roman Catholic individuals who were cannonized, it is appropriate to divide things and qualify things as I had done. There are undoubtably many who will oppose the term """"Martyrs"""" itself in the title because of the modern cultural connotations that it carries like """"Martyrs of Sept. 11 (hijackers)...But it does work if this article is limited to the Papal decree that popularized a phrase - if that is what it is.

"""AIG Loan & IQ==
Should facts should be added about AIG loan in that, the preceding days before this loan was arranged, Timothy Geitner, president of NY Fed, had announced and published in NYC newspapers that he would not make this loan as AIG had been asking for a loan of 35 - 40 billion from the Fed Res for a week. And that public request resulted in the Timonthy Geitner refusal to loan AIG anything.

Then, Geitner, Paulson and Bernake were all 3 informed of the 100s of billions in mortgage insurance that AIG had issued and also the trillions in derivatives insurance that AIG had issued and informed of the further clear conclusions that 
...
without supporting the AIG loan and allowing AIG to fail, this massive amount of market related insurance would cause a global market collapse. This info did NOT come from AIG but from private party to these three, Paulson, Bernanke and Geitner who had no knowledge of AIG's importance to markets.

And today making that AIG loan is credited with saving the global markets from collapse. 

But that occurred as just explained and not from any knowledge of Bernanke, Paulson or Geitner but from advice of outside party that reversed the already refusal by the Fed to loan AIG anything as announced publicly by Gietner. (So that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - NOT Geitner, Bernanke, Paulson)

This lack of market knowledge by all three , Paulson, Geitner, and Bernanke, is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow US Treasury to dictate systemic risk decision, when no one at the US Treasury, other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to 
be able to determine what that is.

Neither worked to have Bernanke ACT appropriately in this global crisis which HE / Bernanke CAUSED
via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused THIS CRISIS.

SO THAT with Bernanke's Higher IQ  did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression.

Demonizing Wall Street for US Government Caused Crisis
In the bubble, all agree was caused by Greenspan, and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by Fannie Mae , etc and by Congress, this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis -  NONE of which was caused by Wall Street.

Then in the fight by Bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes, his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which WAS a smaller part of the USA $ 15 trillion economy.

NEXT, massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by Paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace, the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers....

ALL these events were NOT caused by Wall Street

Then Paulson, Bernanke and later hugely OBAMA and Congress, again and again bad mouthed again and again
Wall Street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by Wall Street when it was mainly caused by the US Governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but Congres and the pundits caused the US population to believe the lie it was Wall Street's fault due to GAMBLING.

ALL distortion 100 %.

Destruction of Capital Formation and Wall Street
One of the key features of Bernanke's job in oversight for the USA economy is in also protecting 
capital formation....

And the engine of economic growth in the USA for 300 years has been the USA efficient capital distribution
to new ventures, old ventures, etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of Wall Street
publicly now and including esp the talking heads on CNN and esp CNBC has severely damaged that core 
of the reason for USA dominance and leadership for those 300 years.

Added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by ALL of the US Government to Identify and prosecute
the huge fraudulent short selling of ALL major wall Street firms and major USA banks which was fraudulent

Well Doug, I've just looked closer at your User Page and see that you're an admin. I will suggest that it would be an improvement to Wikipedia if admins are more clearly identified. An obvious way to do that would be with something like 'Admin:Dougweller' instead of 'User:Dougweller'. Or when an admin posts in their admin function, they simply state that they are admins. Consider how chaotic our society would be if police went up to people's doorsteps without letting them know that they are police.

Evolution has never been observed. Ever. Not one single transitory fossil, out of hundreds of thousands found from hundred of millions of years ago, not one has ever been found. Ever. Not one. No proof.

Fossils of mammals, found tens of millions of year ago, that look exactly like they do today. Through continental shifts, wild temperature changes, mass extinctions, floods, asteroids; they look exactly like they did from the beginning.

200 million year old lobsters look like 2 year old lobsters

There is no mention that no one has ever observed a blue shift.

There is no mention that it's mathematically improbable for evolution to have occurred. No mention that human DNA is so incredibly complex it could not just have come in to being through pure chance.

OK...you all call my behavior 'aggressive,' but I consider it WP:BOLD. You all call my editing behavior 'uncivil,' but I just call it 'being vocal' about the removal of valid material from Wikipedia. I will refrain from using 'strong language' in edit summaries in the future, including capital letters. You say that: """"This is persistent and entrenched behavior on your part that you don't seem to understand or want to change after many warnings and two blocks""""  I've never had any substantial warnings, only the two expedited blocks. You say that I should """"accept the rules"""" when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it. Any way that you put it, strong wording in edit summaries is not a valid reason to perma-block people, as short sentences like that can easily be taken out of context.

Regarding my claims of censorship and vandalism in the above-mentioned edit summaries: I'm not sure what else to call it if not censorship and vandalism...I suppose I could always call it """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles,"""" but that would be whitewashing the issue. For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you? Some kind-of phantom clause in WP:BLP is constantly cited to try to justify the removal of this information even though this information is currently found in thousands of other articles with no problem at all.

When I wrote """"Revery [sic] Jayjg's idiotic edit..."""" in an edit summary for removing Category:Ethnic nationalism from the White nationalism article I only made that statement because the very first sentence of the article said """"White nationalism (WN) is a form of ethnic nationalism...""""  thus the removal of said category seemed rather idiotic in my opinion since the first sentence of the article obviously confirmed that particular category. Jayjg then changed that first sentence (he provided no source for this edit) and removed the category. I never called Jayjg idiotic, only that particular edit.

Since everything I write on here seems to be misconstrued, taken the wrong way, and wrongfully considered 'uncivil' and/or 'aggressive' (what is and what is not 'civil' and 'aggressive' is highly POV and a matter of opinion, by the way), I plan to edit  and remove any and all information that could be considered 'offensive' or 'uncivil'  I am going to bring the page down to the basics.

Truthfully, I try my best to avoid getting caught up in all of these Wiki-politics, personal vendettas, petty edit wars, childish games, etc.; I am part of no group/cabal here, I stick to myself and mind my own business, and improve and expand Wikipedia as best I can. However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages. I would like to discuss these issues (and I always try to leave a good edit summary), but whenever I try to discuss these issues the response I so often get is one or two bogus sentences and the mindless repetition of a bunch of Wikipedia essays/guidelines (NOTE: NOT POLICIES) in an attempt to justify the censorious deletion/vandalism """"the constant removal of valid categories/information from articles.""""

Larkin, Church and State after the Dreyfus Affair, pp. 138–41: `Freemasonry in France’, Austral Light 6, 1905, pp. 164–72, 241–50.
It is highly unlikely that if it were not a copy of this source that the Wikipedia version would use `Freemasonry in France’ (the single quotes are """"`"""" () and """"’"""" () instead it would use 'Freemasonry in France' (the single quote of ' (')

The use as shown above is a breach of WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT.

(NB the article Affaire Des Fiches currently does not use this citation but instead relies of a link to French Wikipedia (:fr:Affaire des fiches which in this context is an unreliable source.)

I came across this WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT problem when editing Anti-clericalism and fixed it with this edit on 27 July 2013. I have only just investigated this problem because that edit also threw up a much bigger problem (see Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Catholicism#Unacknowledged internal copying and problems with citations).

Unless anyone else wants to help I will fix this relatively minor problem by including the original source in the citations, but for those copying text between articles please place a comment in edit history not only does that meet Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia but it also helps editors who follow you to find and fix errors like this one.

Of course some people think that's rather long to say, so the church acknowledges that people will often call the members just """"Mormons."""" Nevertheless, that remains as only a nickname for the church and part of the official name of one of the books of scripture, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, because of the prophet named Mormon who abridged the original writings. The only other official names with """"Mormon"""" in them are the book Mormon Doctrine and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. As for members themselves, reference to them as """"Mormons"""" remains only a nickname.

So you say that the official info box text is to leave it without nickname quotes. So what? Why shouldn't we ammend that official policy so that it makes room for that type of labeling? And so what if there is """"no need"""" (<- those are the """"you're saying it, not me; and not that I believe you"""" quotes right there) to change it? That doesn't mean there would be anything """"wrong"""" (as you'd probably say) with adding them, does it? They are not errant. They are not like adding an apostrophe to a word where none belongs, in an attempt to form a plural! They are good to show outsiders the difference between the official church name and the nickname. What's so """"sinister"""" about that? I say we change WP:Mormon's rule about it. Why not? Well, of course that would require a concensus, but why would people have to be so opposed to it?

What about the intro. of Donny Osmond? That uses quotation marks to set apart his nickname of """"Donny"""" from his real name, Donald Clark Osmond, in the form of """"Donald Clark 'Donny' Osmond."""" So there.

I'm going to revert it back to the original. Feel free to add sentences or add to the article, but please do not delete the prior material that I wrote, as all of it is true, and from someone who was there from the beginning of the scene. Simply referencing a statement to an article does not make the data relevant. For example, this page is on a sub-genre of House. That does not mean you can include a sentence stating: """"Oprah has a new TV network, and they played Techno in the background on one of her shows"""", and then you provided a reference from the newspaper. The fact that you provided the reference does follow the rules, but the sentence has nothing to do with the article on this page. That's why it was deleted. It could be added to a Disco music page though, or a Techno music page.

If you don't mind me asking, what year did you start collecting 'Progressive House' and what is the oldest record in your collection of it?

Regarding the Techno comments. Techno should be mentioned (as the sentence prior to it should be included), but that one sentence I deleted because it has nothing to do with Progressive. Also, Techno in general has little to do with Progressive. Progressive came from the House scene...specifically Acid House and very influenced from the Balearic sound of Ibiza. Techno was an influence but not the primary driver, and very little to do with Detroit.

Technically Progressive House was the next re-branding of House after Acid House, but I'm not going to get into this, it's too complicated.

The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .

In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, """"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away."""" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, """"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,"""" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. 

There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling """"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'"""" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. 
Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of """"atheism and nihilist Communism."""" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel's 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

"Indeed: “Learning curve.” I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operational.First off, I wanted to make an iron-clad-security main page, like ArbCom’s wiki. That wasn’t too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWiki’s security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files (generally images) in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path. That took some reading and trial & error. MediaWiki’s excuse is that “♬♩ MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone, maaaan. It’s—like—about *openness*. ♬” The thing is, those who don’t care to think about security, wouldn’t mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing. However, those making a private wiki who do care wouldn’t want them viewable by I.P.s.And then thumbnails of images wouldn’t work no matter what I did to LocalSettings.php file. Like many things, I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues. It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki. Moreover, installing ImageMagick isn’t a matter of dropping files and folders into the /wiki using FTP; it’s a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do that.And, after all that is done, there are bunch of gotta-have templates like Template:!xt, Template:-, Template:-/doc, Template:Hilite, Template:Nbhyph, Template:Nowrap, and Template:Xt. I think I have all the gotta-haves now. I was the shepherding author/sponsor on a bunch of them so I’m fond of them.I can’t complain about *free* stuff.

Reference for electoral history
When I was looking into the disambiguation of Roger Johnson, I came across the following reference, which I used to cite the electoral results of that election:

The section """"Electoral history"""" was unreferenced until I added this; I suspect that, if someone wants to take the time, this book will serve as a reference for all of these electoral results.

"""::::Sorry for the confusion. I am saying that it is not neutral the way it is now. You are suppressing the POV that is stated in the SF Chronicle “that no one was forced and that no laws were broken” which seems highly relevant given the allegations. So I am saying that the phrasing you are selecting suffer from undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording. Also from WP:NPOV “Verifiability lives alongside neutrality, it does not override it. A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.
Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited. The two are different questions, and both must be considered in full, in deciding how the matter should be presented in an article."""" So based on this I am also reverting.

"""::On reflection, I'm not sure this does actually belong in the lead.  I don't know if I would call """"activist"""" a judgmental word, but I see Jmundo's point.  It is a somewhat inflammatory word.  To many (esp. conservatives), """"activist"""" is an insult.  I think """"activist"""" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style """"activism,"""" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.  There's a lot of stuff in the article that's arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life (especially at Yale, where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there).  What do you think?  If you really wanted to keep this in the lede, perhaps the wording could be changed, e.g. """"She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools"""" or something like that.  But I'm not sure it belongs.  -

I assume his reasoning for the undo was because the added info contained Gogs projected involvement in Final crisis (something that seems obvious, but has not been officially announced.  I removed all predictions and made the added info stick to only the facts given in JSA #14.  I did like the addition of the fact that the origin of Gog in pre-infinite crisis does not match this current version.  Now that the addition has been fixed, I hope that anyone who edits this adds two it and does not simply revert it.  If you do revert something, explain your reasoning so we don't get into and editing war.  Thanks   
 
It is important to note that there have been three different origins for Gog. And all three characters made it to the main D.C. continuity.  His Hyperspace spanning, Time traveling, Multiverse jumping nature makes this character inherently hard to grasp when looking at the multiverse or even just the main DC universe. 
     
First, from the Kingdom Come timeline:  He Survived Kansas's destruction. Given powers by the Quintessence, he stole Superman and Wonder Woman's baby, went back through Hypertime killing Superman over and over again.  He was defeated in the Main DC continuity by Kingdom Come and main versions of the heroes.  

The second version of Gog was basically a homage to the first, but without the tricky use of Hypertime and the Kingdom come continuity.  He survived Topeka's (only) destrucion.  He kept going back in time and advancing his work over and over.  This Guy made it into the pages of Superman comics.  

The third version is the one in the current run of JSA.  He claimed he was got his power from Gog, Last God of the Third World.  And he complained about all of kansas being destroyed.  This origin actually resembles the first more than the second.  This makes it likely that he is from Earth-22, like the superman in JSA.  It is common for the new 52 Earths to resemble previous DC comic's Elseworlds, but have some differences.  It has already been shown that Earth-22 resembles Kingdom Come, but has some slight differences.  This explains the Kansas destruction being the same, but the change in his power source being from quintessence to a Third World god. Although time will tell if this is right, it does seem like the logical conclusion.  Someone can add this to the article when it is revealed in the pages of JSA.   

To answer the above question, the Quintessence were fooled.  Phantom stranger thought that this man, who came out of the Kansas massacre, and started a Superman Church, would be a good representative of the values that the quintessence hold. But they were mistaken (gods a fallible in comics).  The guy snapped after getting the powers, went a little nuts, and killed Superman over and over.  The quintessence decided not to take back their power, but I am not sure if they explained why.",0

 Regarding References Cited 

Thanks for the heads up.  The reason I changed all those headings was because of the following message left after some of my work:
""""This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations where appropriate.""""
This implies since I did not do in-line citations that the source material remains unclear and uncited, which is not true, though I understand Wikipedia's policy for standardization.
I do politely disagree that the word """"reference"""" by itself implies internal citation.  It does not.  Many professional journals' ending sections say """"References Cited"""", because """"References"""" by itself could mean simply works used but not cited anywhere.  That is, it is a """"referral"""" to the actual work.  Thus I did not see it as vandalism, but rather, as clarification.
Thanks for reminding me to sign my posts - I mean to, but I forget sometimes.

I think you're both right. ;-)
We must follow what sources say; if you want to put in a rounded number and make up some error bars, but the source gives an exact number that's a Bad Thing. However, we do also have to be pragmatic; population varies over time, most ways of counting have potential inaccuracies, and we should be open on that point.
So, what do the sources say? An archived link is hardly ideal, so I went looking.
The 2010 census says 24,658,823.
The [UN http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Ghana] estimates 24,392,000 (in 2010).
Should we show both to readers? Or if we just said something like """"24,658,823 (2010 census)"""" then readers are still being reminded that the number may be slightly out of date, and that it's a census result (which is a pretty good source but might have certain limitations).   """,0

Berkshires,

Perhaps you say that you agree with the quoted statement, but you don't seem to get it.

Yes it is true that the Beth Din will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """,0

 I'm not 100% sure what the practice is on sorting subcategories within their parent category.  I just checked, and I noticed that Category:Historic districts in Massachusetts has the pipe character and then """"Districts"""" after it, so it sorts into """"Districts"""" when you're browsing by letter.  That means you have to go to the third or fourth page, or go to the """"D"""" listings, to see the historic district subcategory.

I'm using Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser to recategorize the houses into their own subcategory, so that'll organize them somewhat better.

I have expanded the name section.

Even with the new information about whether SJP has an apostrophe or an extra s, the only way the 'dab page for similar names' idea makes any sense, is if you make every similar name without a target:

 St. James' Park
 St James's Park

 St James' Park, Bristol (article setion pipe link)
 St James Park, Exeter

I still think this is pretty poor solution, when there are no direct conflicts between the actual article names used. I frankly don't see how it is any better than when the articles had dab hats to cater for people who either mispelled links or mis-spelled in the search box. The only advantage to adding (, Newcastle) to the title is for pre-emptive assistance to user navigation in the search box, so in that case, a redirect variation for London, Newcastle, Exeter needs to be created for all similar names that a user might type into the search box, namely:

 St James Park
 St. James Park
 St James' Park

 St James's Park

should all redirect to St James' Park, Newcastle as the current name

I will do that now as it seems a good idea anyway, whether this article stays with """" ,Newcastle"""" added to the title or not. 

The disambiguators with (brackets) are against policy, as geographic disambiguation is done by commas to the next highest administrative sub-division, so these should be deleted.

As an aside, I'd be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles, such as TubeMogul, YuMe and Adap.tv. Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies, especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology.

"Teeth 
I see you want the teeth section better explained.

The idea is that tetrapods that grows slowly (i.e reptiles) continue to grow in maturity. Both the steadily increasing size of the jaws and the wear and tear imposed by a long life dictate continued change of teeth. Mammalian teeth being complex, replacing teeth requires quite a bit of resources, and as anyone having children of pre-school age can attest to, it is also a lot of bother (try eating an apple without your front teeth!). Thus, for the fast-living, high energy demanding life of insectivorous mammals, tooth replacement is kept to an minimum (i.e two setts, a trait retained in their descendants). How do you propose going about explaining it without making it a disproportionally large part of the article? Or is it so important it should be a large part?",0

The state had reported in 2003 that this subsurface [public drinking water] system was subject to a """"high threat"""" of contamination from possible pesticide overuse or potential fuel spills.[9] The federal Environmental Protetion Agency listed nine reporting and monitoring violations for that same system between 1998 and 2001.[10]A 2008 report said Kripalu's well-based water-supply system contained one form of uranium and two forms of radium, in amounts below legal limits, but above federal health guidelines.[11][12][13]In 2007, the state set an August 2009 deadline for retirement of one of Kripalu's wells, due to health hazards exacerbated by a construction project in the area of the well.[14][15] '''

Thanks. 

...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies. 

It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.  

Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.

The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.  

The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. 

Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.

The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.

At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.

Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf, it could get its way...

When one adds that there is only one way to be cross-gendered in the brain, and that cross gendering must be totally separate in any and every way from sexualorientation. That there is in essence one way to be feminine; that is the feminine essence theory.

Interestingly if I understood JamesCantor correctly in a conversation we had on my talk page.  This is very close to what he and sexologist like him belive. However they contend that the way in which a brain is cross-gendered depends on sexualorientation.  Thus take a homosexual male.  Homosexual males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women.  A homosexual transsexual is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female.  While non-homosexual transsexuals, if I understood correctly, also have cross gender structures in their brains, just not the same as a homosexual transsexuals.

I have noticed your action regarding my contribution.

Let me add few comments:
- English is not my primary language, so it is possible that a meaning very clear to me sounds or understood differently to an English speaking born. 

- A page about cooperative should contain, IMHO, a complete information about cooperatives and cooperative movement worldwide. The page now is limited to the official ICA approach, which is not the only one. I may say that this approach prove to be a failure in many parts of the world.

- I have tried to present a another approach to cooperative, and an approach developed in Israel during tenth of years. I can't see a reason why this approach shouldn't be presented on the Wikipedia.
More than this: there are cooperatives in the world who have followed in one way or another this approach. More information can be found: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization.html
A very successful example in the U.S.A can be read here: http://www.coopgalor.com/realization/Oklahoma.html

- This approach is backed by papers published in different places, including ICA. These papers can be read at: http://www.coopgalor.com/i_publications.html#Whats_coop

I'm very sorry that I wasn't able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I'm afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I'm struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I'd like to know how you've managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative?

Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn't have anything to do with such paradoxes?

Hello, and thank you for writing the article Junior Seau Beach Community Center and Bandshell. I have done a substantial rewrite, emphasizing the historic nature of the bandshell. With that in mind, and seeing that you are good at photography and posting photos, I wonder if you might want to take a picture of the bandshell (showing its lovely beach location) and load it into the article in the History section - depending on how the deletion discussion goes. You might also consider deleting the photo of Sanchez and Brown; some people seemed to think there was too much emphasis on minor elected officials. I already deleted the picture of the two councilmembers who voted against the project, viewing it as irrelevant to the article and contributing to clutter. 

BTW when you comment at an AfD deletion discussion, don't bold the first part of your comment unless it is an actual """"vote"""" such as delete, keep, or merge. Those bolded comments are taken as a kind of summary of people's positions and a way to quickly view how the discussion is going; in fact there are bots that summarize the discussion using those bolded """"votes"""", although the closing administrator takes into account the whole discussion rather than just tallying the """"votes. I took the liberty of removing the bolding from your """"merge and redirect"""" paragraph, since it was clear that you were not actually recommending a merge and redirect. You might want to add Keep to one of your comments to make it clear that is your opinion.   """,0

 Happy New Year! 

  Best wishes for the New Year!Wishing you and yours a joyous, healthful, and productive 2013!  Please accept a belated thank you for the well wishes upon my retirement as FAC delegate this year, and apologies for the false alarm of my first—and hopefully last—retirement; the well wishes extended me were most kind, but I decided to return, re-committed, when another blocked sock was revealed as one of the factors aggravating the FA pages this year.  Maintaining standards in featured content requires vigilance, dedication and knowledge of people like you, who are needed; thank you for all you've done so well for so many years!

thank you for your answer. I really appreciate the way you propose to communicate as it gives more comfort for both of us and builds dialog and consensus.

I fully understand and agree with wikipedia rules - thanks to which the quality of articles is high and I want to follow that.

Oppose - The current title is overwhelmingly preferred by the policy of using the most common name, and the manual of style specifically encourages editor discretion. The MOS is great for our writing style and when the official or common name might be unknown, but to argue that it should be used to take an official name with a specifically chosen title that is used by the absolutely overwhelming majority of reliable sources, including books, newspapers, and websites, as well as is the generally common name is fairly absurd. Our title guidelines and policies are unfortunately somewhat murky. But, what it comes down to can be gleaned from Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization), which states that """"an adherence to conventions widely used in the genre are critically important to credibility"""". If Billboard is using a style, and Rolling Stone or the New York Times or Spin or just the bulk of reliable sourcing in general largely use the official title, is it really common sense for us to be saying we shouldn't be following the sources here in order to somehow adhere to conventions and gain credibility? Wikipedia is a unique construct in that our work is so clearly tied and based off of reliable sourcing about the subject  making us stand out and go against the grain here just doesn't make much sense.There's also just the general notion (which certainly should not be the deciding factor in finding consensus) that certain lowercase words just look weird in titles.

"That would violate WP:V, actually, if I understand your statement correctly. ?!? 

 (after ec) I do not understand your question as written, so I will simply explain UNDUE in a general way. Let's say, for example, we are writing about nails. An authoritative work about nails, written by an expert on nails, and used as a textbook, or source for a textbook about nails, would get a lot of weight - we would regard it as definitive. A differing view from a nail manufacturer's website would get considerably less weight, as would a newspaper article about nails. Finally, a politician or celebrity's comments about nails would get no weight at all, unless in their article, not the article on nails. And your cousin Bob's random comments on nails in his blog not only gets no weight, mentioning them on a talk page might be considered a violation of WP:FORUM. Giving a newspaper article the same weight as an authoritative text by an expert is a violation of UNDUE - you are giving a less important source undue weight. Applying this here, then medical texts on Abortion carry the most weight; other sources carry less and less weight the farther they move from authoritative sources.

 All this argument crap. 

In my opinion, 
a) Notability is established in this article in the fact that One Bid is a qualifying game played 6 times a show, every show, 5 days a week, on a highly rated network game show, and has been an element of every version of the show since the original. It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.

b) Original research. If you are read the tag, it says """"See talk page for details."""" If you are not going to either tag with  or start a talk page section explaining what you believe is original research (or be more specific by tagging only the relevant sections), then I don't believe the tag should stand

c) I think this article does need more citations. I think almost every article on wikipedia needs more citations than are currently there. However, since there isn't even a single  tag on the article, I don't see what specific information is felt to be requiring citation. As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens. So if there are major uncorroborated facts in the article, you ought to tag them specifically to justify a refimprove banner tag

d) The merge discussion seems to have been abandonned. I believe it should be appropriately revived and an actual pro/con vote be taken, or else abandon the merge tag. I see no evidence of support from the discussion linked to in the tag.

This is my opinion as to how the tags should be dealt with. It is not sufficient to just say """"original research exists in this article so I'm going to slap a tag at the top."""" (for example). These tags should be supported by specific explainations or pointers to actual problematic content unless the entire article really needs citing or is original research, which I don't find to be the case here.

And also another thing i have to say,that there is no proof needed and also no need of wikipedia's acceptance that """"Sun rises in east"""".

It is as foolish as """"Sun rises in west"""" like way that a christian European like you & a group of shudras when centuries back doesn't have the ability to touch the boots of Kshatriyas when they lived in palaces & Kingdoms,now people like you & your pack are judging the Kshatriyas to be Kshatriyas or not"""".I know you always support unreliable books written in favour of low class Dalits(converted christians) & Bahujans(Shudras) beacause of your anti upper caste Hindu attitude.People will laugh at you and your mate Sitush.All the users like sitush & his pack of dogs will definitely pay for the conspiracy when the time comes and also because truth is even supported and protected by god.

@Jytdog:  I agree with  that your personal views about how regulation works and how well it works is not relevant at all here, and it is a distraction.  Additionally, your definitions of """"mainstream"""" do not comport with Wikipedia.  Wikipedia defines Mainstream as follows:
Mainstream refers to a current of thought that is presently widespread.  It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media.
The mainstream popular majority view is that GMO's are not safe and should be labelled, and with your familiarity with the Genetically modified food controversies article, I'm sure you are well aware of that.  But I'll provide RS anyway.  For example:  [this].  Also, 93% of Americans think GMO's should be labelled according to this New York Times survey.  So the """"mainstream"""" view of GMO's, GMO safety and labeling and adequacy of regulation does not comport with your views of what """"mainstream"""" means.
We all know that Wikipedia is not going to report the mainstream view as if it were a fact, because the public can be wrong and so can the media.  So Wikipedia relies instead on the """"mainstream scholarship"""" WP:VALID or """"mainstream scientists"""" WP:PSCI as experts, not the public and not the views of civil servant regulators, farmers, firefighters or lawyers who are """"in the trenches"""".  This bizarre tangent saying that low level regulators are mainstream """"experts"""" is not helpful to improving the article, because it has nothing to with WP:RS and WP:PAG.

Please provide solid RS to back up your objections and assertions, rather than giving personal opinions and expecting us to trust your views are solidly based on RS, especially when RS is provided that says otherwise.

"""The problem with saying that Warren G. Harding was the first African-American President is that it is a theory that is unproven by fact.  While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:
1) Harding's alleged """"black"""" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.

2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged """"black blood"""", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).

3) Harding was not raised as a cultural """"black"""" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.

4) """"Black Harding"""" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   

5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's """"blackness"""" on """"family stories"""".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.

6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the """"reviews"""" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black """"Black Harding"""" myth.

If Wikipedia were to add information that Harding was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation.

Hello Vert,

I was just doing a cleanup of Clearcut, and noticed your picture entitled Rouge_clearcut.jpg. The caption read: """"Water rushing down a Rouge Valley slope in Alberta, Canada. This clearcutting action was done for the Hwy 407 East Partial extension rather than to facilitate the regrowth of a new stand"""".

Perhaps you could re-upload the image with the correct information attached or upload the Rouge valley image that fits closest with the caption? Cheers.

Biased?
I am curious as to why it would seem that the U.S was singled out for a complete page on national racism? - I have yet to find a page dedicated to racism in other countries such as Africa, Britain, Mexico, Brazil, Iran, etc etc. 

Why is it that a whole page is dedicated to racism in the U.S as if it is/was the only country to marginalize persons by race?

I believe that this page should be merged into a general page of world racism, or just be deleted altogether, it's a little more than """"biased"""" in my opinion.  

See Racism by country. We deal with the """"bias"""" of missing articles on Wikipedia by writing new articles. See WP:CSB if you want to help provide a more global view. By the way, people who say Africa is a country might raise a few hackles among other editors writing about racism. 

The situation in the United States is unique in terms of its special brand of racism, the completeness of the...the campaign against Native Americans, the special circumstances surrounding the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the particularities of this version of slavery, the premises and outcome of the Civil War, and especially the complex time period following emancipation. This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate. Most historical precedents result in one race wiping out the other, either by killing or displacement. To merge this article would be like merging an article on the Second world War into a general article on War, or merging the article on Homo Sapiens into an article on mammals. It makes no sense.
The truth hurts, but it's still the truth. This is a website for facts.

I see where you hesitated with the ellipsis.  The American campaign against the Natives involved such things as biological warfare, enslavement, mass rape, forced migration, and ordinary massacres. It was nothing less then genocide.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.132.84.67   """,0

"""early 2004, before or after brendon's joining, and interviews that say the band was formed in 2005 may be in refernce to when they were signed and became a real band, rather than a basic garage band. Either way, Ryan wasn't necessarily lying and a more fitting title may be a good idea.

 Emo 

This band has emo lyrics, that should be stated somewhere in the article, I would add it myself but I'm probably going to get RV by some sensitive fan. 

Punk-Pop
Punk Revival
Emo

The term """"emo"""" is thrown around so loosly and it's become a label that bands and other people see to be offended by, I don't think that it's necessary to state that in the article, especially since """"emo"""" has no real definition in the first place.

 Former Band Members Section? 

Do any of you think that someone should add a section specifically for """"Former Members"""" and then talk about the controversy involving whether the bass lines in the album were actually his or not? I don't like the fact that it's just bunched in with the current members with no explaination on the dismissal. 

 Wikiproject proposal 

I've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one. The project would be an effort by a group of Wikipedians to build and improve all Panic! at the Disco pages (including members of the band, songs and albums). If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  

many people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed """"none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it""""-ryan ross

""""emo""""

Wouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? """"Emo"""" is basically this generation's """"grunge"""". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because """"emo"""" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. """"Grunge"""" bands hated being called grunge too. 

And there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.

Agreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |  

 Early 2007 album 

It says their new album will be ready for compalation in early 2007, that's not true in Rolling Stone Ryan says He plans to write/ record the album during the summer of 2007 and release it during the fall of 2007. I would add it but i've never done anything like that before so I figured i'd just put it in here. http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/panic_at_the_disco_high_school_musical?source=panicatthedisco_rssfeed That's the link to the rolling stone thing by the way.

 Panic and FOB..... together?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight.

Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing. Again, I have made valid contributions that even Gwen admitted would be appropriate if re-written by a more neutral editor, but what doe that mean really? 98.94.132.166  """,0
"""==Street Gang==
Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """,0

 I wasn't to know that what you had done was copyediting for FAC, because you hadn't stated that you had made those changes on the FAC talk page. I was getting confused because the reviewers are telling me to do something, then I'd go to change it, and I couldn't find what it was that they wanted changed, so I couldn't tell them that it has been done. I'm not saying I don't appreciate your help, but a lot of what you had removed hadn't been listed as things that needed to be removed on the FAC talk page, meaning that they clearly think it is fine as it is, and was also information which I was told to include during the GAN process; thus you was removing content which made it a GA in the first place, such as in the lead. I prefer to do things myself, so I know what's been done and what needs to be done so i can keep track of things, and I kinda feel like it is my responsibility to make the changes considering I nominated it, that's just my opinion. And I did assess each of your edits, I looked at them all, but it was easier for me to undo all of them so I could start from where I left off. Don't take this offensively! • 999

The other reviewer left some minor suggestions but IMO it needs basically a rewrite with much of the same info (but some details of limited value removed) before it can be FA.

Quantrill's Raiders

Thank you for your copy edits and reference work on the article Quantrill's Raiders. You have, by your edits, cleaned up most if not all of the NPOV issues I had with the article. I know I did not have the resources available nor the time at the moment to do much with the article; but I was pretty sure that someone would if I tagged it. My editing doesn't involve Civil War articles but only as they are co-incidental the the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the revenue cutters that operated during and immediately after the Civil War and almost all my reference materials involve the USRCS or it's successor agency, the U.S. Coast Guard. As a Kansan interested in Kansas history I realize that the origins of the Civil War began as far back as the Missouri Compromise and later with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. As a Kansan, one is sometimes referred to as a 'Jayhawk' and that is how I ran across the article on Quantrill's Raiders. It was interesting to me, but I saw NPOV issues with it. Anyway, thanks for your edits and when you feel that the article has been edited enough to warrant removal of the tag, you certainly have my blessing. Cuprum17 (talk)

As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either """"Vatican II is infallible"""" or """"Vatican II is not infallible"""".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:
“There are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” (General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)

This is difficult, because I never learnt all the different names for the parts of English grammar when I was in school: only how to use them.  

Taking the commas first, strictly speaking you are possibly correct in that they could – or even should – be used in the places that you indicate.  However, stylistically it is very bad to split sentences up into very small bits unless absolutely necessary, and it is much better to have a flowing sentence than to implement punctuation that makes the prose harder to read.  

With the """"Churchill devoted his time to educating himself"""" sentence, another way of putting it is to say that he allocated all of his free time to educating himself: if you used 'educate' it would indicate a future goal, not an on-going condition—there wasn't a point at which his education would be complete.  From the website you supplied, I think this page might help at 'Using Other Tenses in Conjunction with Simple Tenses'.

Controversy:  Your point here is well taken but for the fact a person can be well aware of possible distinctions in terminology and still call a magazine a clip.  In actuality, it is the """"firearm experts"""" that insist on a controversy by way of insisting on their terminology.  In other words, because they have taken issue with the layman's wording they have indeed made it controversial and not the other way around.  So while the distinction in wording may not be controversial within their circle of buddies they are in fact responsible for the controversy.  

M-W Dictionary:  When I say """"the dictionary"""" clearly I'm referring to """"the dictionary"""" I cited before in this case M-W.  I am a """"cognitive miser"""" like anyone that takes short cuts when I can, just as you shortened it to M-W.  Rather than grasp at straws in dissecting ones arguments let us focus on the big picture when we know what each other means.  I agree the dictionary isn't for giving an exhaustive description, that's what encyclopedias are for.  However in this instance it does shed some light on """"the controversy"""" as it does indeed define a clip as also a magazine.  The reason for including it is not to give people a better understanding of the differences between types of clips or the different types of magazines.  The purpose of including it is to show the other side of the controversy and according to my research within Wikipedia this is entirely acceptable.  

Agreement: Clearly some people don't agree with M-W just as you and I don't agree with SAAMI's statement that people sometimes refer to """"cartridge clips"""" as """"magazines"""".  The """"experts"""" on weapon's have this fact somewhat backwards and are incorrect as they should state that people refer to """"magazines"""" as """"clips"""".  Just because you and I disagree with SAAMI's statement doesn't mean it should be taken out as a reference and I'd never suggest that.

What I suggest is a compromise.  I agree with you about the references regarding Remington and Marlin as that does seem to fall under OR.  M-W however doesn't fall under OR as it is a published source and being a leader in its industry it could be argued is the authority on word use.  Do you have any suggestions on how it could be incorporated so as to show how this controversy is perpetuated?  Without saying it's wrong because it clearly isn't according to common usage.  I'm thinking something like this....Clip technically defined.....use to describe magazine is controversial....however M-W defines it as such.

This allows readers to see their is a difference in terms, there is a controversy, and why it potentially exists or is perpetuated.  I think this is fair.  Note well that I never attempted to remove any sources that backed up what you're saying here.  I'm not interested in destroying your view, only presenting both sides fairly.  """,0

I have a lot of sympathies for Mergism, but in this case, it's a bit tricky. A Structurist solution might be better here. I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with """"Main article: ..."""" just under the heading of each section. What I don't like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.

Although the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, """"preimage of the neutral element"""" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the """"General Case"""" section. (The """"Mal'cev algebra"""" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. 

Null space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.

Hmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.

"The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology. I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance.

"US States name game is a terrible example 

Due to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:
Over 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.
Almost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.
The only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.
There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)
Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)

"""heading. My common usage understanding of the word is that it means statistical information about something, or the study thereof. My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.
My own interest was how broad the term demographics is, and whether when discussing a population it would include information about the land area, climate, how wet it is, all that sort of stuff which undoubtedly affects and influences the people living there, even though it might not be the sort of information collected by modern advertising executives. I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   
 I completely agree with you dictionary. However the key phrase is """"the scientific study of human populations"""". Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.

"Nice to meet you, 92.xx. You ask some very good questions. I'll be glad to answer them. -)
One of my great passions in life is learning about a broad variety of different topics: computer sciences, physics in a general sense, world history, geography, biological life, etc. But above all else, I am extremely passionate about human rights. In the most general sense, I support freedom for everyone, regardless of their life situation. With regards to most of the causes that I support, not only have I taken the time to read about them on the side, but I've also followed news developments pertaining to them very closely. For example, I oppose the ruling family of Saudi Arabia because of their hardline Islamist ideology and authoritarian methods. To start with, I consider Saudi Arabia guilty of gender apartheid against its women, who aren't even allowed to leave the house without wearing an abaya and being in the company of a male consort. It's the only country in the world where women are not permitted to drive. They are also known for severely discriminating against expatriate workers from throughout Asia and Africa, abuses against the Shiite community in the Eastern Province, and publicly beheading people for nonviolent offences — they literally still perform executions on charges of witchcraft and sorcery.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg in a laundry list of reasons why I detest the Saudi monarchy. What makes it worse is the fact that there doesn't seem to be any outrage over their human rights record, which deeply troubles me.
Granted, I don't think Saudi Arabia is a controversial state to denounce. Some of the ones I've listed are no-brainers to most people: a free Burma, the end of totalitarianism in North Korea, etc. But then there's the more divisive issues, such as Kosovar independence or the Syrian civil war. I have been following the latter since before the uprising even began in March 2011; already very familiar with the human rights situation in Syria, I was fully anticipating the Arab Spring to arrive there sooner or later. I also knew it would be far more complicated than any other Arab country, if for no other reason than for the fact that it has a society divided along sectarian lines. I support the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. I believe that he and his regime have committed large-scale crimes against humanity for the sake of retaining power (yes, I do think he deployed sarin gas in Ghouta). However, unlike many others, I do not see opposition to Assad as being mutually exclusive from opposition to al-Qaeda and its affiliates, including its Syrian branch Al-Nusra. They too have committed atrocities, specifically against the Christians and Alawites. The long and short of it is, I support a free, democratic, and secular Syria. Easier said than done, but it never hurts to be optimistic. Now, Kosovo is an entirely different story. The region has a very complicated history, especially during the existence of Yugoslavia as an independent state. I'll spare you the lengthy explanation of the context, the situation after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the guerrilla war conducted by the terroristic Kosovo Liberation Army against ethnic Serbs, the resulting ethnic cleansing campaign against the Kosovar Albanians conducted by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, the UN presence in Kosovo, the 2008 declaration of independence, etc. All you need to know, as it pertains to my support of Kosovar independence, is the fact that the vast majority of people in Kosovo support it. Everything else is immaterial to me; it's what the people want that I care about. The issue of Kosovar Serbs should be resolved through negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo. Those are just two examples of my less popular stances.
Asperger's Syndrome is considered a pervasive developmental disorder on the autism spectrum. At its most basic, you could say it is simply a mind form of autism — but that in itself would be a drastic oversimplification of what is a very unique condition. Every case is different, and I have a particularly mild diagnosis. Most people would never guess that there was anything different about me. It's more in the negative way that I would oftentimes interpret subtle nuances of socialization. For example, if I overheard two people having a conversation and discerned my name, I'd get nervous and assume that",0

As I say, you can't read English closely and this generates numerous misprisions in your understanding both of sources and what others say.
A pointer, one of many possible ones, on how not to construe elementary English.
I am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history, unless they are practiced historians.
(a)does not allow you to infer, and repeatedly say, that the meaning is: Nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics, nor they believe in that science.'
Where in that sentence do I state that I am unfamiliar with population genetics, and disbelieve that discipline? I am saying nothing about genetics: I am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline, namely historiography. Peer-reviewed geneticists have RS credibility as geneticists, not historians, as peer-reviewed historians have RS competence as historians, not geneticists. Sometimes you have dual competence, as with C.D. Darlington, or Jits van Straten, but the geneticists you cite, if you check the historical books in their bibliographies, use dated or unreliable sources for their history, and make frequent errors, as many reviews have shown.
(b)'You protest my writing:'What geneticists define as 'Jewishness' in Europe relates to male founder genes' and call me a racist who insults Jews.
Here you fail to understand what geneticists define as 'Jewishness'. I am not using that language, the view is not therefore mine. If you have a problem with this take it up with Harry Ostrer, whose work you keep citing, or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the DNA reveal """"a biological basis for Jewishness,""""..
Reflect on this. You keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. It's a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my English is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor, making reasonable remarks, is an antisemite.

"This plot description is much superiorcomments? 

“Joliet” Jake Blues is released from the Joliet Correctional Center after serving three years of a prison sentence after being convicted of armed robbery. Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment). At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Band.
  
As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall. 

After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher). The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room, the mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.

Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with a U.S. flag and an Illinois flag).

Jake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom “Bones” Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie “Too Big” Hall, Steve “The Colonel” Cropper, Donald “Duck” Dunn, and Murphy “Murph” Dunné) known as “Murph and the Magictones”, are playing in an empty Holiday Inn lounge, “The Armada Room”, and are readily convinced to rejoin The Blues Brothers’ Band. Trumpeter “Mister Fabulous” (Alan Rubin), now maître d' at a restaurant, is more of a challenge to persuade (“you ain′t never gonna get ’em outta those high-payin’ gigs”), but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him with some dining-room hijinks. En route to meet saxophonist Louis “Blue Lou” Marini and guitarist Matt “Guitar” Murphy, The Blues Brothers drive through a rally of neo-Nazis (upon whom Jake comments “Illinois Nazis—I hate Illinois Nazis!”) and adding another enemy to the The Blues Brothers’ growing list of pursuing parties. Marini and Murphy are working at the soul food restaurant on Maxwell Street, in Calumet City, Illinois, which Murphy owns with his wife (Aretha Franklin). Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group obtain new musical instruments and associated equipment from Ray (Ray Charles) of Ray’s Music Exchange, in Calumet City, Illinois, on loan, pending payment from the proceeds of The Blues Brothers’s Band’s pending ‘triumphant return’.

"Reforming Wikipedia is an impossible feat, i fail to see positive improvement on articles. I find it remarkable that so many keep reverting so much. The ability for growth is stifled. I have seen 99% of Maya books and articles use Ahau instead of Spanish Ajaw yet the editors of Wikipedia like to stand out as different. Only a hispanic would promounce Ajaw as Ahau. Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way! I find that's what happens to words. In the 1970's the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows. So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray, they all say Rah. Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language. Can hearts of men reform. Please prove my doubts they will. I think truth is stifled and smothered.

 Best Quote Ever

You can click through to the link, but I think that the references in the article should be a bit more contained.  It's a zinger of a sentence, but it refers to a very specific piece of knowledge that the article shouldn't assume the average reader has.

"This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.

If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.",0

It would be really overdoing things to include convolutions with more input functions in the sandbox article, but I plan a gallery-like page in the info still to be uploaded to gnu.org.
Development of the convolution theme includes other mathematical concepts. Far from being a """"one-trick pony"""" you ought to know that the mathematics of the delta function, alone, lends itself to further visualization of subject matter routinely taught in dsp and related courses. Besides the ability to code, Development only needs imagination.
As the article indicates, I too made the mistake that Fortran was a dinosaur. Fortran is under active development, surpassing the performance of C in certain areas. I also code in C, Lisp, Scheme, and will be writing some code for C-Graph in Python - but modern Fortran remains a good choice for the core code.
There are websites that offer the demonstration of convolution, but none that encompass verification of the convolution theorem with ease, or that offer the range of features GNU C-Graph does. The download statistics verify C-Graph's growing popularity.
The meritless claim of """"online promotion and documentation (marketing?)"""" has been recited elsewhere and is transparent in its intent.
Yes, you did miss the point. I won't comment on the other """"significant"""" additional resources and external links listed in the articles on Convolution and Convolution Theorem, except that they hardly present """"new science"""", which is not a requirement for a reference.
No, it's not possible to deflate my ego. I'm accustomed to these types of responses - and use them as building blocks.

Enough said. The reason more information on C-Graph is not already at GNU is because I find myself having to spend too much time dealing """"blocks"""" in various forms. Wikipedians visiting this talk page have the text for the references should they choose to use them. Happy editing!

Talk:Female genital mutilation; please stop
Hi Elvey. I noticed you on Johnuniq's page, which I watch, and was moved to check out the discussion at Talk:Female genital mutilation. Your part of it worried me. While I have no opinion of my own on the statistics, as FGM is not a field I've studied, I see two principles in play on that talkpage, that are true for all articles, and that you seem to pay scant attention to: 

1) Use reliable secondary sources. It's important (for all articles, but more especially for a sensitive subject such as FGM) to be based on reliable secondary sources. Synthesising sources in order to argue, in Wikipedia's voice, with a UNICEF report from 2013 isn't on, unless you have a reliable source (as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources) that offers the same argument. 
2) Consensus. Nobody (except partly Vetrisimino0) agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article. There is consensus against your section tags, described here as """"overly aggressive"""". I hope the issue of the tags has blown over, but a few days ago you kept restoring them, and defend them aggressively; the fact that the article is being prepped for WP:FAC seems to anger you further, and makes you accuse SlimVirgin of WP:OWN: a serious accusation, which shouldn't be made without good evidence, and which you have taken to SV's user talkpage as well.

Combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users. Everybody else is speaking respectfully to you, as far as I can see; you're the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this, where you call Zad's comment """"blatantly untrue, not to mention insulting"""" — based, as far as I can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done (he wasn't). That kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people, """"eggshells armed with hammers"""" (Google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships). Please don't jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you. Worse, your header here is a noxious bad-faith-assuming personal attack, something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers. And you put it as the header to a post by SlimVirgin, which you had moved there from your own talkpage. That is truly awful behaviour, seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off. (Charming edit summary at your own page, btw.) If you can't stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever you're contradicted (this post, aggressively attacking Johnuniq, is a charming recent example), I advise you to take a break from the article. That's advice. What I tell you, as an uninvolved admin, is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before, and you must stop attacking people. Your accusation against SlimVirgin that she is """"abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute"""", currently at the bottom of the page, is made up out of whole cloth as far as I can see. Has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin, or warned you in any way? If I've missed where SV is playing the admin card, tell me where. The word """"disrupt"""", which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation, is by no means _ the prerogative of admins.  | talk .

I appreciate that you are trying to improve the encyclopedia by dealing with the conflict at FGM by taking the discussion here.  I wish you'd participate in the discussion of the facts instead.  I feel that in coming here, you raise/reiterate some good points, but I don't think you should be raising the first few, at least, here:
""""*1) Use reliable secondary sources."""" (emphasis is in the original)  I totally agree, and I said that in the discussion, """"The sources are given and reliable and secondary."""" and """"Also apropos """"Anything about prevalence needs a strong secondary source,"""" are you saying that the source we're using for reporting the UNICEF stats in the first place is better?

Phrases like those below pepper the entire article displaying obvious POV.

""""Christians identify Jesus as God incarnate and the Messiah.""""

You're not even Maltese, how do you expect to correctly edit a page about a person who's only notable in Malta? Sure, you can rely on articles you find online, but as you may have noticed, pretty much all the media is against Norman Lowell and his party, for obvious reasons. There's even a website dedicated to """"spreading the true agenda"""" or whatever  . But of course, everything you read is only partially factual and mostly biased... and rightfully so, but such information has no place on wikipedia. Perhaps you'd be interested in writing a """"criticism"""" section? That would make more sense.

On a side note, regarding the banning of Norman Lowell...it is well-known in Malta that Lowell was banned from the media, but unfortunately I could only find one source stating that. The person interviewed in the article is the editor of one of the most popular Maltese websites, www.maltafly.com, on which Lowell has been frequently made fun of.

Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation

Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below):
Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc... 
Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.
Nobody can agree """"not to make unilateral edits"""" (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.
He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour.
Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told me he was going to """"try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while"""". He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight.
It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment.
If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.
I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.

Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to me. I feel it is only fair to mention it here.

Hence, my opinion is:
Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.

But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.  12:35, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I have read the above and agree with Pfortuny.   13:14, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Last sentence was inserted by Alex after reviewing the text in my subpage.  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

 Demand for too many sources 

Some people have demanded way more sources than are necessary for this article. For example, the request for a secondary source for the fact that The Inquirer has criticized the publication of EG's real name. This is utter rubbish. From WP:NOR:

An article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims.

"I am confused as to how I could have been bloked for Vandalisim. I have never vandilized anyones work.

If Wikipedia is about accuracy, then I am confused as to why I would be banned from editing a un-factual article...particularly when I make sure to source my additions or changes. Everyone does this on Wikipedia, if I am going to be blocked for this...Jdorney should to, sine he does the same thing...or do editors get special treatment.

Another ridiculous complaint was made by SWATJester about the SAD article. The original SAD article was missing some facts, so I put facts from sources like Time Magazine, LA Times, Newsweek, and the New Yorker

The Decision to Come to America
We lived very nicely in Skala. We always had a servant and we had a new house that had just been built. We lived very nicely until the fire. Everybody tried to save their own property and it was windy and the fire spread all over the city. Our house didn't go because it wasn't directly in town. But all businesses and everything else went. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]

After the fire, it was a time of great migration. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]
[Note: The """"Great Fire of Skala"""" is believed to have taken place in 1899.]

I came to America because my father didn't want I should become a soldier and eat not kosher stuff there in their army. My brother Sam came before me. He sent me the shiffskarte, ticket. And he sent me some money to come here and I paid him everything when I started to work. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]

All the enterprising young men came, because they were poor and to escape the army. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Brill]

I don't remember my father [who died when she was young]. My mother wanted to come, but only the three of us were left in Skala, my mother and Ada and me. My other sisters [who already were in America] couldn't afford to take us together. So I was the first one. I came just because Jake went [she accompanied her male cousin]; otherwise I wouldn't go. I was a teen-ager, thirteen or fourteen. I didn't want to come to America. I was crying. [Chana (Anna) Menchel]

We came because we couldn't make a living there. It would be a shame for the girls to go as maids in Skala. There was no way of making a living. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel] 

 
From Skala to Hamburg or Antwerp

7. Emigrants took the train from Skala We went by train, all the way from Skala to Hamburg. [Yankel (Jacob) Wiesenthal]
We got the boat in Antwerp. First we went by horse and buggy to some neighbors in another town and we stayed overnight there. And then we went by train to Antwerp. Another thing I remember, of course, we were third class and they stopped for a while for you to get water. There was no water on the train. So I remember my mother left us three kids on the train and she had a kettle and she went to get water and I nearly died. The others didn't know the difference. I felt sure the train was going to start without her. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
 

 
In Hamburg
We stayed overnight in Hamburg before we went on the ship. I remember I was really very young. I was a kid. And when we came to Hamburg, I was afraid. I only wanted to go to sleep with my cousin Jake. So he says to me, you can't go to sleep with me. Don't forget, you're a girl; I'm a man. You have to sleep with the girls. This I'll never forget. [Chana (Anna) Menchel] 
8. The emigration hall in Hamburg, early 20th century 

 
Aboard Ship

9. Aboard ship We were three children and we had one berth. All the four of us slept together in one berth. With our mother. You know how narrow those berths were. [Maryam (Mary) Wiesenthal Brill]
We were in an upper berth. And there was a very rabid Polish lady coming to America in the berth below. She probably didn't like it that there were four people above her and she started out with a real hatred of us. Anyway, one day I wet myself and some of it went through. So then the woman went to complain to the captain. And she said, """"Not only did this woman's child wet my bed, but she stole my best blouse."""" She accused my mother of stealing her blouse and they came and looked among my mother's possessions, but they didn't find it. [Usha (Dorothy) Wiesenthal Gross]

 

We came through steerage, of course. Somebody else was in the room with us and my mother said in Yiddish, I hope my daughter doesn't get sick. But I was very sick and so was my mother. [Hudya (Ada) Menchel]

I went on the boat twelve days. I took care of Anna. She was sick already and I had trouble with her. We",0

"A True Story

Once upon a time, there was this guy who'd edited Wikipedia anonybously for many months (let's call him Derek). Derek edited anonymously so regularly hopped from IP address to IP address. He was very happy making contributions to what he believed to be a reputable encyclopedia. He worked as a journalist at a London based newspaper in the real world, and in the virtual world, Wikipedia was one of his many hobbies, where he edited this and that and made a small difference - so he liked to think. But then Derek made a huge mistake - when he tried to take on the cyber bullies - and  and came off the worse for it.

It was the afternoon of [[Monday[[ 7 April 2008. Derek had the day off work and was online and browsing Wikipedia. He happened to click on an article about the Radio 2 traffic presenter Sally Bowsman via the random articles button, and he noticed a piece of vandalism. Derek reverted it.

Derek's next move was to look at who had added this piece of vandalism. He knew it was against Wikipedia rules to vandalise pages, so issued a user warning to the chap involved in the vandalism. Derek then decided he would keep an eye on this individual so that he might revert any more vandalism that  might commit.

And lo and behond,  did exactly that. Derek reverted more vandalism and issued further warnings. Even when  made a personal attack against Derek, accusing him of having a personal interest in these other articles, Derek issued the appropriate warning.

Things eventually got to the point where  had used up his four lives - that is, he had been issued with four user warnings; and still  continued to make disruptive edits. Derek therefore decided to approach WP:AIV and report this. Derek then looked at Tom's page history and discovered that he was a regular disruptive editor with rogue edits stretching back over a year.

A user by the name of  promptly blocked the user. But two hours later, he had what can only be described as an attack of conscience and he unblocked .  didn't really give a reason for this about face other than that he had made a mistake. There then followed some discussion between Derek and Todd, and  even threw in his two penneth. Todd suggested Derek and Tom should chill out. Derek thought that a jolly good idea, and Derek even posted a friendly message on Tom's talk page urging him to make sensible edits - after all, unconstructive edits damage the reputation of Wikipedia, and the thing which damanges Wiki's reputation further is when rogue editors are allowed to continue making rogue edits willy nilly.

Tom began editing again, and he was soon being his old disruptive self. Derek reverted the edit, then decided to go back to WP:AIV and report this new offence. Unfortunately though, this is where he came unstuck.

 soon accused Derek of Wikistalking and promptly decided that  and so he deleted Derek's report - he didn't even have the decency to leave it for another admininstrator to assess the situation.

So Derek came away with a blooded nose for his troubles, and Derek feels he has no choice now than to leave Wikipedia. He posted the following message on Toddy's talk page:

    Unfortunately, your decision is a bad day for common sense. By reversing his block you have given him the green light to do as he wishes. Furthermore, you have also now made a personal attack against me. I was trying to help clear up what I saw - when I checked his edit history this afternoon - to be a long-standing problem which nobody appears to be willing to address. It seems whenever one tries to stand up to the bullies, one comes away with a bloody nose for one's troubles. Well, on your heads be it.

I maintain that those who view and use the word Ebonics as being a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, are either totally ignorant of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics or they are fully aware of the origin and true meaning of the word Ebonics and elect to use word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive. Since by definition to counterfeit is to: “try to deceive by pretense or dissembling.” the propagation of a false definition of the word ‘Ebonics’ as being a synonym for BE, AAVE other English language based appellations, with the intent to deceive, is larcenous counterfeiting. Given that by definition """"to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one’s own"""" and using a """"created production without crediting the source"""" is plagiarism or literary theft, when use is made of the word Ebonics (an original idea and word coined by Dr. Robert Williams as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other English language based appellations, this deceptive pattern of practice is ‘plagiaristic’ dishonesty or ‘literary theft’ that violates national and international laws protecting ‘intellectual property’ rights. This kind of plagiarism or stealth of ‘intellectual property’ via literary theft and the intentional perversion of the truth should not be tolerated and the authors of articles and books as well as publishers of dictionaries including Wikipedia, progating counterfeit and plagiaristic definitions of the word Ebonics must be held accountable.

What I dislike about your proposed version is that it doesn't carry the forms / aspects distinction which was the point of my proposal. I think it's extremely important to have this distinction in mind. a) If we're going to keep """"political liberalism"""" in there, we need to call it an """"aspect"""", because no liberal objects to what's been called """"political liberalism"""" here, so it doesn't exactly make sense to call it a """"form"""" of liberalism which people argue over. b) The reason I insist on this is that modern political ideologies borrow certain aspects of liberal thought, and then abandon others. The """"aspects"""" division gives people the power to understand the influence of the liberal tradition by comparing it to other ideologies with these categories in mind. The perfect example is that of """"social conservatives"""" who (can be) economically liberal without being socially liberal.
In any case, if the forms/aspects division is tossed, then I'd rather that those sections called """"cultural"""" and """"political"""" liberalism also be removed, or placed in a different section, since they already describe essential / noncontroversial issues within liberalism.
IIRC The only paragraph I ommitted was the last one about modern-day liberalism/lip service, since it was already discussed earlier in the section (and seemed out of place given the topic of this section). The other sections were shuffled around to one place or another.  """,0

Except the video I haven't seen anyone naming him as Mohammed Afroz except the video of IndiaToday earlier tagged there and as far as I remember the Delhi police never revealed his name. So I am highly doubtful. Despite whatever his name is, WP:BLPNAME prevents from naming someone whose name has been intentionally omitted officially including in court records and isn't allowed to be named publicly. In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true.

"Nuclear Reactor 

Nuclear reactor [1] or a nuclear reactor, a device for performing a set of nuclear reactions under control. The laboratory scale apparatus for the production of specific isotopes, radioactive materials (radioisotopes) Prtvdarvha as well as for medical and laboratory and industrial scale for the production of electricity are made 
History 

The first controlled nuclear fission energy was achieved in December 1942. Construction and operation of a cell led by a form of graphite bricks and uranium and uranium oxide fuel successfully concluded. The cell nuclear football at the University of Chicago was the first nuclear reactor was operating. 

 Reactor Building 

Despite the diversity of the reactors, almost all of them are composed of the same components. These components include the fuel cover fuel to slow neutrons from fission, cool stacks for transporting thermal energy from the fission process is controlled to control the fission rate. 

Fuel for nuclear reactors should be such that undergo fission neutrons can be obtained. Five Fissile Nuclides that are currently used in reactors. 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu. Some Nuclides from the thermal neutrons for fission and some fast neutrons are also produced by fission. Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily. It is also possible to obtain, making a comfortable, relatively low cost and non-hazardous chemicals and other benefits in terms of fuel. 

Pod reactor 

Nuclear fuels are put directly into the reactor, but has always been used as a cover. Covered or sheathed fuel, moderator and coolant it apart. This corrosion protection and fuel the spread of fission products from irradiated fuel to the environment is prevented. The pods could also fuel support structure and heat transfer to help. Materials such as fuel pods have good thermal and mechanical properties and the chemical interaction with the fuel material is stable environment. It is sheathed with a low cross towards nuclear interactions of neutrons and is resistant against radiation. 

 Neutron moderator materials 

A substance that can slow or rapid thermal neutrons are used up. The kernel has a mass close to the mass of the neutron is slow is best. The reactor will be used for the lower neutron absorption cross-section should be. Due to the properties of slow, there are some substances that can be used. Hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon are some examples moderator. Because beryllium is toxic, it is too low to be used in reactors. The isotopes of hydrogen, heavy water, and the water and carbon, in the form of graphite as a material to be used. 

Heavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls. But in non-industrialized countries like America and Canada, it means much gram and kilogram quantities without any specific authorization of the manufacturers or supplier chemicals supplied. The price per kilogram of heavy water with a purity of 9899% in about 600 to 700 dollars. It also can not use enriched uranium and heavy water plutonium production reactor construction. Just as pure carbon, super slow since the Nazis use of impure carbon use, they did not notice the truth of America's first experimental nuclear reactor in 1942 and the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test of the plutonium bomb, known as «FAT MAN »the manufacture of enriched uranium or heavy water is not used. 

Cooler 

Heat from fission in the reactor or fuel must be removed from the heat too high or the fuel rods melt. Heat is the fuel in the reactor power may be used to generate electricity. Characteristics of the coolant should be directed to heat the heat transfer can be effective. Also, chemical stability and lower neutron absorption cross section of two major properties Knndhast cool. Another point that must be noted",0

I think there is a confusion about what the LDS project tag means. It doesn't mean or imply that this is directly connected to the church, that there is an official relationship or anything of the sort. It doesn't even show anything on the article page at all. It simply marks the topic as something related to Mormonism and therefore of interest to the editors working on LDS-related articles. Considering that one of the most prominent allegations against West Ridge is that it is a """"Mormon gulag"""" it most certainly appears likely that the LDS wikiproject might be interested in this page. Again, to reiterate this changes nothing on the article page, so I don't see what the concern is.   """,0

Should the British EngD be mentioned in the article as a """"professional doctorate"""" ?

A few English universities now offer the degree of """"Doctor of Engineering"""" (EngD), which, like the PhD, is also a research-based degree, but differs from the traditional UK PhD in several important ways. Specifically,

1) A PhD degree is normally pursued full-time by a student while in residence in a university department under the supervision of a faculty member. Accordingly, PhD-level research is more speculative/abstract in nature, with an emphasis on producing results that may be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and are of academic interest. 

2) The EngD on the other hand is normally pursued by a candidate while he/she works as an employee in an outside company. Most EngD research is carried out in a designated industry (as opposed to a university department or lab) and is jointly supervised by both an industrial and a university supervisor. Accordingly, EngD-level research tends to be application-oriented in nature and designed to meet the specific needs/interests of the industrial sponsor. EngD candidates are still required to produce original research that makes a significant contribution to existing knowledge on his/her field, but, in many programmes (AmEng """"programs""""), it is customary for EngD candidates to submit a portfolio of engineering projects in lieu of a longer monographic thesis to fulfil (AmEng """"fulfill"""") the requirements for the degree.

3) EngD programmes normally include a more formal coursework requirement than the traditional English PhD. It should be stressed however that many engineering departments in the UK (e.g. at Cambridge) now require that PhD students take lecture courses and their associated written exams in their first year in the programme. 

4) (POV) No matter what the Research Councils say, the EngD is still generally seen in academic circles as inferior to a PhD. For example, I doubt an EngD would be acceptable as a qualification for appointment as a Lecturer in a university, whereas the PhD of course is the standard qualification in England for an entry-level faculty position. 

Because of its industry-oriented nature, the EngD is normally referred to in English academic circles as a """"professional degree"""", even though it remains a research degree as emphasized above
(there are no """"professional doctorates"""" awarded in the UK by coursework only like the American J.D for example). 161.24.19.112  """,0

 Article needs overhaul 
 This pages need serious considerations of revisal.  

An ethnic group means sharing a large element of genetic relation amongst its members. Afghans (Tajiks included) are closer related to Northwest South Asian populations GENETICALLY, than to Iranian populations. 

http://www.zackvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/genome_Zack_Full.txt.cleaned_BGA_4.png

Iranians, on the other hand, genetically cluster with South Caucasians, Anatolians, and Mesopotamians. The only relation Tajiks have with Persian Iranians is a shared language and somewhat-shared literary culture. Other than that, the genetics prove that they are not closely related groups.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 This pages need serious considerations of revisal.  

i agree, this article need serious consideration as soon as possible for revisal

the article is totally misleading. tajiks and afghans should have their own article and like other nations, persians (or iranians) should have an article of their own. perisan is only an ancient name for iranians. please consider correcting the article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Exactly, this really is extremely misleading. There already is a """"Persian language"""" page- the ethnicities are distinct.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 request of an administrator  

Please revert this article, this article is full of errors. iranians and afghans are two different nationalities and ethnicities. they can not be mixed according to wikipedia rules and according to the fact that persian (iranians) and afghans are not the same thing and can not be in the same category. thank you  

 Second Paragraph Should Be Deleted 

""""Afghanis, better known as Afghoonis or Efis and Afaghaneh, are not part of the Persian people and they are acting as wannabe persians, they are not proud of their nation and we Iranians hate them hate them hate them.""""

This should be taken out of the article, for obvious reasons/
  

 afghoonis are not Persians 

afghanis are not persians, austrians speak german but are not germans and they do not consider themselves as germans, they are neither considered germans by the people of germany, the people of switzerland speak french but they are only swiss and it is wrong to call the swiss peoiple as french people. the people of belgium speak dutch, but they are not dutch or netherlanders, the people of brazil speak portuguese but they are not portuguese people. they are brazilians speaking portuguese. the people of ghana speak english but they are not english. and finally the afghans speak a dialect of persian. but they are not persians racially or ethnically or historically. afghans are ethnically and racially a mixed nation. the tajiks, are related to people of central asia, to the people of uzbekistan, turkmenistan and tajikistan. the tajiks of afghanistan look exactly the same as tajik and uzbeks because they are the same. the hazaras are not related to the iranian or persian race, they are of mongol origin, their hazaragi language which is a dialect of dari language, is heavily mixed with the momgolian languiage, their look and appearence attest to the fact that they are only assimilated mongols. even the word hazara is a millitary unit which describe that they were a part of  the mongol chengiz khan army who destroyed civilization of iran including nishabur and tus and many other cities of khorasan. (khorasan is in iran and is iranian, not afghani or afghanistan). 

tajiks are iranized or persianized central asians, like uzbeks are turkified central asian people. tajik is NOT a synonym of persian or iranian, tajik only refered to people of central asia which became iranized,",0

"About so called caste formation in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is not a separate process, most sociologists and linguist call the shared cultural region as Tamilakam. In Wiki we have to rewrite the article to reflect this reality. If you read the Kerala and Malayalam entries, and www.kerlahistory.com site this new idea is brought out. Hence Kerala and Tamil Nadu are hitched at the hips up-until the 10 century regarding their cultural development. 

Caste itself is not a proper word to describe the social condition of South Asia. What is more accurate is Jati and Varna.  According to linguists like Proff Hart of Berkeley and others, indigenous societies specifically in South India there already were societal cleavage based on certain lineages that were slowly cornering certain economic productive mechanisms such as cultivation, fishing, security, drumming, bards etc. This was in response to a move away from hunter gatherers to slash and burn to settled agriculture and cattle herding. 

The Sangam literature which is a kaleidoscope of the social conditions prevalent in ancient Cera, Chola and Pandya countries describes a situation where there was a lot of flux and violence used to maintain the economic advantages. In this milieu the northern ideas and people were also added their system such as the Varna. But in reality what the Brahmins  did was to become just another Jati to fit the local model already prevailing and added religious sanction on top of the violence that is needed to maintain the Jati system . Thus  Brahminism, Jainism and Buddhism were  very important in pacifying the populace that lead to the development of later great empires. 

The word Pulaiti and Pulayan are used in Sangam literature to describe people serving chiefs. They were attached to the wealthy because apparently they were dispossessed or had nothing to independably live on. The name of the Kannadiga caste is Holeya. Where Hole in archaic Kannada means menstrual blood thus indicating that even before Tamil and Kannada became independent certain lineages may have become debased. As you know that’s a long time ago:)) 

Why is ancient Tamilakam important as opposed to rest of India to understand the unique caste system. Because it was the last frontier to succumb to Indo Aryan population and cultural advance into South Asia. Further it maintained its cultural independence just enough to record (via the Sangam literature) the prevailing conditions before culturally becoming part of rest of India after the Bhakthi period. Today so called separate Keralite and Tamil cultures are just another appendages of a greater Indian culture with minor regional variations.",0

Again, there remain very few facts that we can associate with GG overall short of what's in the current History section - it is a war of opinions here, that's why its a controversy.  Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS. So because ethics claims have been discussed, if not then debunked by the authors in the next breath, in these highly reliable sources, we can discuss them in a non-prejudging way and then later include the criticism of them; that's how we meet all content policies. End of the day we cannot appear to take a side in the GG issue, and everything you have said above is against that point. And that I'm """"trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories"""" to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them.

It is odd that China, socialist country, does not guarantee health care for all its citizens. It does for many, but not for all. As far as I recall it had more to do with the government being unwilling to pay doctors enough to persuade them to work in the rural areas. They can earn more in the wealthier cities.

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t

Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war.

I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0

Relevant/Accurate Facts?
Many of the facts or generalizations are in fact opinions.  For instance, the suggestion that one million dollars is needed to live in the US without working is highly subjective.   (one could live on $500,000 quite easily, based on the average rate of return for conservative investments like mutual funds.)  Furthermore, actual cash is not necessary - many people live comfortably on businesses worth less than $100,000 that they own.

Also, using Marxist language in the initial definition shows a political POV, as in """"The main defining characteristic of the working class is its dependence on wage-labor (or salaried employment) as the main or only source of income, because of lack of capital assets or land that could provide an alternative source of livelihood.""""  In reality, one could argue that the main defining characteristic is simply whether one is in management or whether one uses physical labor or 'brain' labor.  In today's economy, it is not simply the lack of capital assets or land that may indicate working class, but also a lack of marketable knowledge.  You can own 100 acres of rural land in most US states that would be impossible to earn a living on, while having the right knowledge could earn you a living anywhere.

Finally, the alleged sexual habits of the working class (citing research 57 and 32 years old) is irrelevant to this article unless we are going to take the ridiculous practice of defining working class by their sexual habits.  Also, judging certain sexual habits as sophisticated shows a POV and this whole section is childish. 01:11, 16 October 05""",0

Basically I agree that since there are diverse assessments in various RS on the topic of this article, all statements should be sourced. 
You mention a """"consensus theory"""" that includes Germany along with Italy (1918-1945), which is something with which most people would not disagree. The time frames are relevant to discussions of the left-right political spectrum characterizations, etc. As pointed out in Great_depression#Germany, for example, the Great Depression had a severe impact on the unemployment in the Weimar_republic#Onset_of_the_Great_Depression, facilitating the rise of the National Socialist party, etc.
It would seem evident that monumental disasters like the Great Depression had an effect on the ideology of Fascism and other movements as well. I'm sure that the sources address these issues much more thoroughly than is reflected in our article. For example, the following paragraph cites no sources whatsoever, does not even include a Wikilink to the Weimar Republic article, and seems to be generally lackingThe events of the Great Depression resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies. The most important new fascist regime was Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany, and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

I can't understand Jeffro77's first objection. Nowhere do I see a claim in the text that anyone other than the committee are the authors of their translation. The committee do announce explicitly that a privilege was granted to them. They are not thanking men for this. We have to adopt a scrupulously NPOV in quoting the donor of that privilege. It is a notable item of Jehovah's belief that all the books of the Bible have a single author in contrast to mainstream Christianity that acknowledges a number of authors at different times. But I choose to say """"a heavenly Author, not the heavenly Author, to avoid getting into loaded and POV consideration of that Author being unique or not.

To Jeffro77's second objection, it is clear that Jeffro77 takes """"inspired"""" to mean """"divinely informed"""" and that Jeffro77 deduces from known dates of publication, that Jehovah's Witnesses include their own translation NWT among the 1 300 or 1 800 uninspired ones. I have no argument against that logic. However it may be too near WP:SYN because the Jehovah's Witnesses may not intend or even be aware of that argument's logic. Unless someone provides an source that says explicitly that the NWT is among the uninspired translations, we may not generate our own criticism this way. However the categorical claim by Jehovah's Witnesses about a remarkably large number of translations on which various faiths rely is notable in our survey of criticism of the NWT.

Greetings and blessings. 
I have edited the links section to add few Mashichist sites to give a greater range  of Chabad views on the issue of identity of Moshiach and the proccess of redemption. While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the """"Breif history of Chabad Messianism""""  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but
 the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.
I have also added the http://www.YudelKrinsky.com as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

 Stop the partisan bickering!!! 

I have done a review of all the sources for this article, and here is a synopsis (all emphasis is mine):

NYT: 3/17/03  """"An Israeli Army bulldozer today crushed to death an American woman who had kneeled in the dirt to prevent the armored vehicle from destroying a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials said.""""

CNN: 3/25/03  """"An Israeli bulldozer killed an American woman Sunday who had been protesting its use to destroy Palestinian houses in Rafah."""" ... """"Other witnesses, however, reported that Corrie had scaled a pile of dirt but then lost her footing and fell backward behind it, out of sight of the bulldozer operator. The bulldozer continued moving forward, covering Corrie with dirt and then crushing her.""""

BBC: 6/27/03  """"... Rachel Corrie died in March during a protest against the demolition of a house in the southern Gaza Strip. She suffered multiple injuries when an Israeli Army bulldozer ran over her and later died in hospital.  However, the army said that military police investigating the incident found that Corrie was killed by earth and building rubble falling on her as she tried to climb on a pile of earth while the bulldozer was operating.""""

Seattle Times (AP): 3/17/03  """"The International Solidarity Movement said Rachel Corrie of Olympia, Wash., was in the line of vision of the bulldozer driver Sunday as she stood in his path to try to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in the Rafah refugee camp. ... The Israeli military said Sunday that Corrie's death was an accident. It said small windows in the bulldozer's cab restricted the driver's vision.""""
 
Haaretz.com:  """"A 23-year-old American woman, Rachel Corrie, a college student from Olympia, Washington who belonged to the International Solidarity Movement in the territories, was killed yesterday by an IDF bulldozer during a house demolition in Rafah.""""

Guardian (UK) - 4/14/03  """"An Israeli army investigation into the death of Rachel Corrie, an American peace activist, has concluded that its forces were not to blame for her death. ... Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions.""""

Jerusalem Post: 1/5/06  """"An IDF investigation into their daughter's death ruled that it was an accident, but members of the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement for whom Rachel, 23, was volunteering at the time of her death claimed that the IDF bulldozer driver saw Corrie and drove over her as she and a small group of ISM activists tried to stop him from razing a home.""""

Observer (Guardian) (UK): 1/23/03  """"A peace activist with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), Corrie knelt in the path of the Israeli machine to prevent it demolishing a house near the Egyptian border in the southern Gaza Strip.""""

These 8 sources are the most reliable mainstream sources current in the article.  They agree on these basic facts:

Corrie was killed by an IDF buzzdozer;
She was protesting house demolition by acting as a human shield;
The IDF investigation concluded the death was an accident;

It seems to me that various editors on one partisan side of this debate here are trying to whitewash this article by repeatedly inserting weasel words such as """"she believed was about to destroy ..."""" while editors on the other partisan side of the debate are trying to insert extra detail about (e.g.) home demolitions, that properly belongs in the article on that topic (i.e. the widespread nature of it, etc).

I do not understand all of the byzantine rules of Wikipedia yet, but I find this whole situation ridiculous  I agree that the article should limit itself to facts that directly bear on Corrie, and not the larger Israel-Palestine conflict or home demolition (or arms smuggling) issues, but also that the lead should state plainly that Corrie was killed while trying to obstruct home demolition, and that the IDF has stated that the death was an accident.  All the rest of the weaseling is just plain wrong, and borders on the pushing of subtle (and not so subtle) propaganda from both sides.

From what I read, partisans from the pro-Israeli side have been sent here to influence this article, and I have no doubt that there are partisans from the other side as well.  Can we just oust the partisans and say directly what the eight mainstream sources above say?  Tom Ketchum

You quoted above an expression for acceleration. That expression is correct. I am not disagreeing with it. But it tells us absolutely nothing that would enable us to solve a motion problem.

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls.   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.  Thus when I spot an inconsitency in their pieces and add some correct and especially logical words to their precious piece they get their knickers in a twist and childishly erase my effort and thus leave all other Wiki readers just as ignorant as they themselves.

This is Fascism and more fitting to Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia that the wide world of today.

I will nevertheless continue to add, subtract or otherwise modify and improve various Wiki articles I find as part of my conviction that eductaion should be progressive not regressive.",1

Again from the Duel books pushing what was a politically driven firing trial in order to prove the quality of the armored plate.

Evidence provided by Carey Erickson concludes that the tests were politically motivated to artificially bolster the performance of the US 76mm gun over the 17 pounder gun which was unfairly  marginalized during the tests the Panthers themselves according to the researcher had significant battle damage (burned out, multiple hits, to front plate ,etc.) or were hit many times to lower the plate resistance before the tests were recorded. 

small excerpt:
  Panther Ausf. A tank labeled as No. 1 listed as having a good quality plate was in reality was face hardened (a curious rarity at this point of the war) and took 9 rounds to weaken the plate enough to allow penetration. Evidence also shows that the Panther tank No. 3 had serious battle damage before being subjected to the firing tests which should have excluded it from being tested in the first place. 

Therefore these tests are not an indication of poor quality Panther plate but rather an indication of the politics at the time I suggest a removal or an amendment informing the reader to the nature of the political nature of the tests.",0

Also please read this excerpt of what I wrote:

You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get """"components"""" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function """"x"""" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni. 

I notice you said that you didn't know what """"Fourier series"""" is and it shows since if you did know you'd see that the above is perfectly correct math. Feel free to consult anyone. But don't remove perfectly legitimate math just because you don't understand it. I don't want to insult you but I find you're insulting me by deleting text because you don't understand it.""",0

It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

If you are familiar with MIS (the church's membership database), you'll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year. However, if their parents are still members, their names are kept in MIS (not as members, but part of a family who has a member) with the parents until they are 18. Non-Baptized spouses are also included. If I remember the designations for these are """"Child of Record,"""" (0-8) """"Unbaptized"""" (9-18) and """"Non-Member"""" (18+). They used to have an """"unaccountable"""" designation as well for those with disabilities who don't need to be baptized, although I've not seen it recently (no """"unaccountables"""" in my last ward that I'm aware of), and they'd also be included with """"Child of record"""" in my opinion. Church statistics are more accurate than most other denomination's """"estimates"""" and the computer system designates and distinguishes quite easily. The Catholic Church for example bases theirs on country statistics - if a country is deemed """"catholic"""" then 90+ percent is counted as being catholic - even if they are not, or if they have had their names removed.

I've changed this article's assessment to C-class from Start-class. It's clearly no longer a start anymore, and developing some clear structure and order.

The history section seems to be a little heavy on the subsections, and some of those could be combined. Some of the subsections overall could have shorter and more concise titles as well. There are a good number of photos in the article, which is good, but they seem to be cluttered over on the right side of the article, and should probably be placed a bit more evenly. Also, many of the image captions are very, and should be shortened as well. Photo captions, as a rule, shouldn't really introduce any new content to the article, and should be brief enough to simply describe the photo they're attached to. All photos should also be relevant to the article text and sections that they are placed in as well, with some sort of text in the main article discussing it.

 Pope Francis article: quote from Jerusalem Post editorial 

Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an """"article"""") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing """"editorials"""" and """"news articles"""" as different types of """"articles"""".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.  In the meantime, I have asked for the opinion of other editors.  Hope we can all agree! Best wishes, and thanks for all your good work on this article.   """,0

"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

The quote provides no context, is blatantly POV, not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly, considering what actually happened with the election fraud (see http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-36.htm) and the fact that Gore actually won anyway.  So how did he make Dubyah the president?  Yes, I'm aware that's the first thing many people think of when they see him, just as the first thing many people think of when they see Mama Cass is that she died choking on a ham sandwich.  This, like the quote, is not true at all, but merely an ill-researched fallacy.  Does this mean we should write in Cass' introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich?  No, because it simply isn't factually based or accurate at all. Even if it was accurate, it still wouldn't be appropriate for the introduction as it provides no context. Pretend you are someone who didn't know anything about him, and you saw this quote that he """"made George W. Bush the president""""-what would that mean?

Comments made in an argumentative tone and accusations of sockpuppetry do not help to resolve it. I don't think the quote would be such an issue if the rest of the article was fuller, but when Berhalter's international career is summed up in three lines it comes across as undue weight. That an athlete shows confidence in the run up to a major tournament is not surprising, the key is the context in which such a quote is used. As the article stands now, the reader is not given any information about Berhalter's role at the 2006 World Cup other than stating that he was an addition to the squad. Appending the quote to this gives the impression that it was one of the defining moments of his career. As Berhalter was a substitute in all three games, and did not take to the field at any point in the tournament, this is clearly not the case. Perhaps it could be referenced in a sentence such as """"Berhalter expressed confidence in the ability of the USA team in run up to the tournament,Czechs and balances: US foe able, aching, The Boston Globe, June 12, 2006 but was an unused substitute in all three group games.

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t",0

You were quite right to correct my edit. Buckley's comment shouldn't be excised on its own; all of them should go - it doesn't matter who any of these writers are, their aesthetic judgement comments are all just POV opinions (of no greater weight than yours, mine or anyone elses, though Buckley's is particularly ridiculous, let alone in a Wikipedia context) and therefore not encyclopedic in nature and therefore not Wikipedia compliant. 

Even worse is the completely uncited statement above """"Like Bowie's 1971 song """"Life on Mars?"""", it evoked a world where film and reality become merged and confused"""". Says who?? And indeed who cares, Wikipedia is not the place for editors' subjective comments. That is potentially endless.

Wikipedia makes it abundantly clear that it is not a opinion forum, or a vehicle for people's differing aesthetic opinions; it is an encyclopedia.

The only quotes that would be acceptable (and of any interest) in this regard would be one's directly attributable to Bowie, Visconti, Eno etc i.e. the creators themselves. It would be extremely productive to seek any out. What the article needs is facts - for example, details of where recorded and on what dates, who the personel were etc etc, all properly cited.

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1

 Article Clean-up 

I decided to do a major over-haul on the article. I tried organizing and removing information that isn't neccisary. The article still contains the major section but they are just cleaned up now. It didn't take as long as I thought too. - 

 Co-host auditions 

I think that the audition seciton is not as relevant anymore considering it's been a year and their is a 99% chance that none of the """"contestants"""" will be announced as winner. Does anyone else agree with me that we should remove the section? -

Incomplete Segment List

I noticed last time that there was a complete list of segments that were there before AOTS started its new set. Now after they got back from E3 and the new set took effect, some of the segments are gone, both former and current. In order for a wii to be effective and accurate, ALL of the segments, including those that are deleted, should be listed. So somebody needs to add the deleted segments there please.  

I cleaned up the section around that time and deleted segments that didn't need to be listed on the article. There were also a lot of segments listed that only happened once or twice. Also there were a lot of skits listed as well which are not segments. I think after a certain period of time old segments probably won't be relevant to the article. -

 Article Cleanup Co-Ordination Point 

 Cleanup Co-ordination This article has recently been tagged as requiring cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.
The article may have been flagged as needing cleanup because it has been suggested that:
the article needs formatting, proofreading, or rephrasing in comprehensible English. 
the article has multiple overlapping problems. 
the article is very short and might need expanding, removal or merging with a broader article
For a full list of possible problems see Wikipedia:Manual of Style.

You can use this section to discuss possible resolution of the problem and achieve consensus for action. When there is a consensus that the article is cleaned up please remove the cleanup tag from the articleDiscussion
To be honest, I do not know why this was tagged as needing cleanup. I think the information is laid out pretty much as well as could be. I do feel that the History section needs work, but everything else looks fine (and the tables listing the show's features are quite excellent), so I don't think a cleanup tag on the aritcle as a whole is necessary. However, I am not going to simply remove it, as others may disagree with me.   

I got the botmessage on my Talk Page when I logged in today, and it said that this  article needed cleanup. I checked it, thinking someone had shifted the tables all around or made all of the paragraphs single-sentence rambles... But it was essentially the same as it always was: tables in good shape, information about the cast, etc. This might never be a complete article (seeing as it airs 5 nights a week) but I don't think a """"Cleanup"""" tag is necessary in this case. Maybe something more specific is required, but I would support deleting the tag.  

Still has the cleanup message, and I don't know why. It's not like the page is getting vandalized; it was put on Semi-Protection on January 26th. Any thoughts on this? The article can never really be """"complete"""", since the show is an ongoing process.

Speedy deletion of Spunga
 A tag has been placed on Spunga, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I am really disappointed with the dictatorship you Wikipedia administrators carry out.
In your particular case, you still want to imagine you are living in the Meiji era. Okinawa is NOT another country anymore; the Okinawan tongue is a dialect of Japanese, like it or not (it was established so by the government years ago, after carrying out extensive linguistic research, and realizing the grammar is the same) (Palau, Korean, and Ainu are clearly not related).
I can't understand how Wikipedia can let a soldier, a brutish animal without intelligence, closer to the neanderthal than to the homo sapiens, have more authority editing articles than an expert in the subject.
And you Americans are clearly the most retarded people on Earth. Now I see why Americans in Japan can only get the ugliest and most retarded women out there. Bitches who, if they don't marry a dumb American, will end up single forever.

 Dear Michael, thanks for your reply. Once you introduce torsion, there is this critical uncertainty about what the """"minimal coupling"""" means. The coupling that decouples the torsion altogether always has to be allowed - and it's probably the right one. There are various other fundamental problems - that it's not really clear what the theory should be to describe the real world. Even if you want to couple Einstein-Cartan theory to ordinary electromagnetism, there exists no candidate for a """"minimal coupling"""". Moreover, the newer, more well-defined versions of the Einstein-Cartan theory, e.g. due to Stelle and West (involving non-commutativity as a justification), actually predict big enough phenomena and can be falsified. For both claims, see e.g. the 2009 paper by Gibbons et al.  (the falsification is described in the comment about 1,000 seconds; Gibbons is a senior guy who wrote important papers with Hawking and others). I think it's valid to say that any concrete enough version of the theory - including couplings to known types of matter - can be falsified and has been falsified. So the concept is only surviving as a vague one, with a wishful thinking that there could still exist a viable version of it. But no such version is known - at least not a natural one. What's really missing is the motivation. In string theory, one can see that there's no torsion, perhaps except for the H-field (a 3-form) but the H-field doesn't have the usual normal properties of the Einstein-Cartan torsion field. In fact, in 4D, the H-field may be Hodge dualized to a scalar, the universal axion, and such fields are naturally massive - otherwise new long-range forces would have to exist but they don't. If they were not massive, you would really modify the GR even at long distances, and created new polarizations of gravitational waves, altered the prediction for gravitational lensing, and other things. All these things are absent according to observations as well as string theory. Moreover, the very idea about the """"minimality"""" of the couplings has been changed in the 1970s by the insights of the renormalization group. We no longer prefer """"simple"""" couplings because they look aesthetically and subjectively simple but because we can technically prove that these couplings - and low-derivative terms - prevail at long distances. This modern kind of reasoning leaves no natural room for torsion. So  all the motivation is just historical in character and can't be reconciled with the modern way of organizing fields and terms in field theory, and the people who defend it don't understand the last 60 years in theoretical physics.

"Secular vs Religious 

I need help

Neutrality.  How do you add secularism to word God, and to word martyr???  These words can not be secular. 

Word martyr is in many religious texts as we can see in the contents section, now just because someone decided to name some people martyr's in some event that happened in time who didn't even die or that did die doesn't make them martyrs, even though we call them. 

Now this word is used by secular people the word God is used by secular people when they say that God is someone else other than God.  This is the same problem with this word.

I need help with these trigger happy undo button pushers suggested by automated program that counts bytes???

The word martyr means witness yes, but we do not mean a witness in court here ) , we mean a witness in religious terms here, so there is no room for secularism on this page just as there is no room for athiests on religious pages, and religious people on atheists belief's pages )",0

"Suggestion on Dead links output 

Hi there! Seems like a nice tool that. However I couldn't find description of it anywhere? Perhaps the output would be more readable if it was slightly rearranged. Currently the output looks to me almost machine readable! First, most people are interested only in certain subjects on Wikipedia, so in my opinion it would be best to start with the article in question. The exact time parameter seems almost redundant as the entries keep coming so often. At least, maybe it could be hidden somehow or be output last in a small font? Perhaps also add headlines so people could just scan the table of contents for their favorite articles?

 Spin-off, character pages 

When first writing, for example, The Brittas Empire character page, I thought it was written in 'an in-universe style'. However in retrospect this does not seem to be the case entirely, and I will be reviewing the page shortly.

Just a quick point on 'Edio*Magica', although it wasn't you who blocked me directly, it was still rather silly to think I would vandalize the very pages I have been improving (Sooty & co., The Brittas Empire), and to think that I would replace content with insults directed at myself. Due to the blocking I had to create this new account in order to edit pages, but I'm willing to forgive and forget about the misunderstanding.   
It wouldn't be the first time that someone has disrupted Wikipedia. In the past, we've had people create vandalism on one account, so that they can look good on another by fighting it. I realise, though, that your case is that there are probably some other bored little school kids using the same computer pool as you. talk to me 
Well i'm glad you've seen sense. What makes their actions even more pathetic is the fact they're university students; nevertheless they seem to have stopped now.   
Why don't you try and build an article to WP:GA standard, and get a better idea of conventions? Many of the articles you edit really could do with reliable sources. talk to me 

 Image removed from The Brittas Empire 

Are you sure the image you removed is not perfectly acceptable? It is a screen shot I took of the series so doesn't belong to any organization, and from what I’ve read relevant screen shots adding to an article are acceptable. I think you should have discussed your action before carrying it out.   
Having seen sitcom articles through FAC, I'm sure. Non-free images can only be used if they convey information that words couldn't express. My action was in accordance with the knowledge I possess through extensive ediing in accordance with Wikipedia's policy and guidelines, rather than ones I make up as I go along. talk to me

 That the """"crisis"""" was about Zelaya pushing ahead with a referendum the Supreme Court opined was unconstitutional.
 That the """"crisis"""" was about the lack of a clear cut constitutional procedure for impeaching a president, therefore implying that the coup was justified.

As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense """"is"""" to """"was"""" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): 
""""Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]"""" 
I think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn't matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the """"incident"""" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don't think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It's also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as """"crashed"""", per Wikipedia policies. Taking into account what I said, here is a proposal for the lead:

If an official would just refer to the plane as """"presumed crashed"""", then the following could be added as a second paragraph in the lead:

We go nowhere like that
Comment. I don't feel ready to back the one or the other position here. For the time being I feel a bit closer to Dhan's position but from a different point of view. I just want to point out two things:
According to a Greek historian, Paparregopoulos, some hellenized Phanariotes families, like Ghikas' family, had lost their Greek identity in the 19th century. This fact seems to justify the use of """"predominantly"""", since in indicates one thing: In the 19th century not 100% of the Phanariotes families had a Greek indentity. Maybe they were 99% but even this 1% justifies the use of """"predominantly"""". I can live without this word (I can also live with the word!), but, if Dhan wants to add it, I cannot prevent him (at least, according to my logic).
If we accept that 99% and not 100% of the Phanariotes were Greeks, this does not affect at all the traits of the Greek War of Independence, as Miskin has said. Ok! Not 100% but maybe 99% of Phanariotes played a role in this war? What does it change? Nothing! A big fuss for nothing! 
I'd like Dahn to further substantiate and back with additional sources his arguments. What about some Googlebooking?! Everybody could do that, in order to reinforce one's arguments.
In any case, I don't think that we can solve this dispute on ourselves. The problem is much deeper. There are two extreme positions and no intention for a compromise. Therefore, I think about inviting an objective third party in this discussion: I speak about  """,0

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea.

"I understand quite well how evolution is supposed to work.  I understand the capriciousness and contingencies in the workings of evolution.   It is the paragraph in question, especially the example in that paragraph, which distorts the workings of evolution.  The phrase “it need only increase at a rate of 0.005 cm per generation (= 50 cm/10,000)” easily gives the impression of progressive linear change.  The anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often (I assume inadvertently) find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of Darwinian evolution.  From these I have often read how evolution “invents” various forms and functions.  Carl Sagan, in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters, injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the Galaxy.

Moxy, I get rudely rapped over the knuckles when I refactor. But you get away with it. Never mind, because in any event there seems to be a WP rule for everything, and a WP rule against everything. The real intellectual challenge seems to be to find a balance between the two, which nobody inluding myself seems able to do.
Re unsigned editor above: Thanks. You have been the very first editor to provide helpful criticism and guidance, which I believe is supposed to be the function of administrator. Usually my work is simply undone and reverted by admin and others without discussion; a kind of slap in the face. Talk about civility. Hmmm. Nice people. 
 Suggestion: instead of administrators and others engaging in endless displacement activity, why isn't anyone prepared to address the real issue around here, namely the primary issue I raised (again) at Reply to uninvolved intervening party which bears repeating: 
 WP:FRINGE, (and probably other wiki rules as well), states that: """"In general, Wikipedia should always give prominence to established lines of research found in reliable sources and present neutral descriptions of other claims with respect to their historical prominence (and) ideas should not be excluded from the encyclopedia simply because they are widely held to be wrong."""" Please note that the rule does NOT state: Wikipedia should always give prominence to established WESTERN lines of research found in reliable WESTERN sources."""" Yet this is exactly what the existing WW2 article does do. Not even one non-Western source is cited among the 340 odd sources cited .... 
 On my bookshelf right here beside me are no less that seven English language non-Western histories of WW2, some of them by Soviet historians. So there's no question about the existence of English language non-Western histories. These are considered reliable and established lines of research in their respective non-Western countries of origin, just as the Western sources cited in the article are considered to be reliable and from established lines of research in the West. Therefore both Western and non-Western positions should be reflected in the article, if it is to claim that it's NPOV, which it is not. Forget about all the efforts to discredit me, some of which are perfectly valid. Just address the issue at hand, namely POV bias through omission as repeatedly alleged by me, and which has resulted in a lot of displacement activity that seeks to evade the central issue of NPOV. Even or especially the intervening administrator has managed to evade the issue. The unsigned editor in this section admits that he has reliable access to history library resources so, if he has the time and inclination, maybe HE can come up with some reliable non-Western sources in the interests of NPOV, which everyone claims I'm contravening (among other things).

Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

An article like this can show many different theories and still remain POV.

WegianWarrior explains it well: """"Wikipedia isn't about whats valid or not, its about what can be verified. It's a verfiable fact that these claims are made by a number of conspiracy theorists."""" And Blueboar's statement (""""If a source discusses directly the theories that are the topic of this article, it does belong ... no matter what its viewpoint on the theory"""") is valid and useful in this discussion.

Ukufwakfgr, your incivility diminishes greatly the legitimacy of any argument you make. It would be more effective if you left out the abrasive language and cries of flamebaiting and focused only on how to improve the article. By providing a list of what needs to be fixed, removed and added (without being abrasive), other editors will be much more likely to work with you. For example, if you think parts need further toning-down, quote the current sentence as it appears in the article and then provided what you think would be a better way to say it. You're going to have to play nice or not play at all.

Lastly to all, please review Staying cool when the editing gets hot and Civility. Even if you feel you are on the correct side of an issue here, sarcasm and curtness aren't going to help. Insults and abrasive language is not congruent to the way things work around here.

Call me as you want. I call my self as patriot. If Poland was victim of history? Well much more then Germany, more then Russia, more then Belgium etc. We were just between two major powers of Europe in the corridor, flat territory where all goes back and forth. This is the difference between Canada and Poland. Its geographical location. You should think about it.

Do you mean forgot the blood which was bloodshed. You do not know what you talking about. It should be never forgotten just for the sake of future generations. In Germany still Nazi party exists.

>but her own leaders did not act to Poland's best interests in the situation, and that is why what happened happened.

What happened? The II WW? Anyway do you believe Canadian leaders doing good job? It is only shallow impression because some economic prosperity.

>If Poland's own rulers hadn't of weakened her before the partitions, the partitions wouldn't of been successful, end of story.

Yes, democratic countries are weak. Poland was in some sense democratic country (less then USA of that days).
Possibly if you know the constitution 1791 was the second on the world, just after USA. Beside role of “Solidarity” in last century it indicates something. Any way my impression is you know little about Europe history. There a lot of small countries which participation is important.

>asking someone """"are you a Nazi?"""" implies that you think they are. I don't know about in Poland, but when we meet a new person in the English world we don't automatically ask them """"are you a Nazi?""""

It was not automatically in the case of so many German arrogant. It was only an example in conversation with you. It was not a personal question. You to often exaggerate.

> and finally I don't care how or why Poland is suffering!

That is bad. You show many consideration how poorly German were treated expelled from Poland. Now you show no respect to the death in concentration camps. Just beautiful. I could not expect anything more. Now: Are you Nazi?

For sure I need not lecture from you how I should treat my fatherland. Also I need not lecture how to treat German revisionism. I am not revisionist I accept the present borders of Poland ))), I do not look for revision. You do.

 What Makes a Person Notable? 

After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's """"Notable People"""" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him """"famous"""" as well as detractors who consider him """"infamous"""".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   """,0

Angus's suggestion of """"suspected by the IRA of being an informer' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute. 
Sarah argues, """"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer."""" She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?
And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? 
Sarah's other point that """"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter"""" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics. 
The number of Protestants in Cork who were home rulers would have been tiny and the percentage who supported the separatists minute and can pretty well all be named like Miss Dorothy Stopford or Sam Maguire.

 WP:BLP/WP:OR violations 

I removed the following passage because it is a clear violation of both RP:BLP and WP:OR and makes extensive use of weasel words.

 But some suspect that Erdogan's virulent attacks on Israel are rooted in anti-semitism and hostility towards Jews. In Turkey, according to a survey in early October 2009, 53 percent of the population would object to having a Jewish neighbor. He has been accused of exploiting such prejudice for political gains: On October 8, 2009, he stated in a speech at the Yildiz Technical University of Istanbul that he has been watching """"the Jewish model of success"""", pointing to """"their [the Jews'] buisness instinct"""", and claiming that """"Jews are able to make their money multilply while seated.""""En Turquie, le premier ministre, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, exploite un sentiment d'hostilité vis-à-vis d'Israël (Le Monde, October 19, 2009)

Describing Erdogan's criticism of Israel as """"virulent"""" is a NPOV violation (nor is it meaningful English). Quoting survey results about the opinions of Turkish citizens is WP:SYNTH and irrelevant to Erdogan's own beliefs. Also, nothing that is quoted is actually negative about Jews.   """,0

You know, my friend Derek Wilkinson owns the 1st edition of Beauty & the Beast. When I watched my copy, I found out it was the 2nd edition & I thought it was the only edition ever made. So, 1 day when I went to his house, I saw the trailer of Sleeping Beauty, then it said the """"Special Previews"""" bumper & thought to myself, """"Where's the Pinocchio trailer? Did they cut it out? Is this a 2nd version from 1993? My copy of BATB has that trailer."""" I never saw the end of the 1st edition, but once Marco on this website told me he owned it, he told me that the Pinocchio trailer was still on there, but it was at the end, with the """"& now, here are the 2 special previews from Walt Disney Home Video!"""" bumper & the 101 Dalmatians trailer after that. Then, I figured out that's how they originally made it & that my copy was the 2nd edition from 1993, when Pinocchio came out. I saw on the Page of Fortunecity that it dtopped out in 1993, but I wasn't sure when in 1993. Then I found that my copy was from 1993, when Pinocchio came out, so I was sure it dropped out when Aladdin came out & was sent back to the Disney Vault. BTW, since you told me that you saw the 2nd edition of Beauty & the Beast & you have a column on your user page called """"Videos I've Seen"""", you could list down you saw that tape. Also, you might be able to know this, but if both editions of those tapes, along with 101 Dalmatians & The Great Mouse Detective have an Aladdin trailer, why doesn't the 1992 VHS of The Rescuers have an Aladdin trailer?  21:22""",0

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0

*  *  *

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

 4) Now this admin is so pushed over the edge, he looses focus of the policies and rules he's here to defend and instead lashes out in every direction banning people at will

 5) Another editor comes in and helps diffuse the situation, who works with me to get the original sources provided into a restored story. I'm told the page is live and that blocks were removed.

"First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that.

Some make mistakes and commit crimes, but they are highly regarded by crime victims who get the satisfaction of seeing their tormentors get locked up.

You point out that newspaper articles reporting Dr. Harold Kade's egregious mistakes, one of which put an innocent man in jail for five months, say nothing about Kupcinet, therefore they aren't relevant to her case.  If the articles said he was a careless driver who got off work one night and then crashed his car into a truck carrying tissue samples to another lab for analysis, thereby making that person's death a total mystery, then your point would be valid.  An accident that Dr. Kade might have caused when he wasn't on the timeclock tells us nothing about his competence while he was on the clock.  We know he was on the clock when he put an innocent man in jail for five months. We know he was on the timeclock when he screwed up another case that was unrelated to that unfortunate man.  Therefore his screwy actions while he was working are relevant to yet another mysterious death that he was supposed to solve but didn't (Kupcinet). At least he didn't solve it to the satisfaction of those gossip queens known as sheriffs.  If they didn't cut open her dead body, then they knew nothing, right?  The woman's father didn't see the autopsy, either, and he actually was considered a gossiper by some people, so to hell with him, too.  Right ?

If I did, Wildhartlivie would want a footnote citation that identifies the producer of the segment and what he ate for breakfast on the day it aired.  Someone else would remove it on the basis that as long as it had nothing to do with China, anything Nixon said about others' flaws was a lie. That's good enough for me, but you're just going to say Watergate was a separate entity that had nothing to do with Kennedy or Monroe, therefore Nixon could have said they were both transsexuals and that's legitimate. 

Let gullible kids who read Wikipedia know what that great man said about an emotionally fragile woman he never met.  Your logic is cockeyed.  Unlike Monroe, whose autopsy was performed by a relatively competent doctor named Noguchi, Karyn Kupcinet was permanently screwed up by a klutz. Deal with it.  If you keep banning his klutzines, maybe you can delete the entire article about Jack Kevorkian. How do you know your body will be treated fairly the next time you visit a medical doctor ?  You don't.  If you're dead you don't complain.  Deal with it. Life sucks. People screw up everywhere, even in a room full of fresh corpses.",0

"""I've started a background section here, mostly from paper sources.  i bought Jeff Davis's bio of Rozelle as an online book.  Feel free to whatever, it is not fully sourced or written yet.  My concept is Background, Game play (all the way to the end), Network and reaction (might have to be split depending on length, and Aftermath.  Cut out most of the present article.  The Jets were pretty upset about the officiating and were eventually fined by Rozelle, which had nothing to do with the television.  Michaels and Dr. Andrews were pounding on the official's locker room, Walt Michaels was shooting off his mouth, and they called the reporters in midweek to show game film of """"blown"""" calls by the officials.  The Jets stayed in Calif as they were playing San Diego the following week.  

 Archiving 

I shall need you to modify the image descriptions as I upload game program images that I screenshot off eBay so they have an archive url.  The eBay links will rot in a few months.  The first is here.  I think we shall have a well illustrated article by the time it runs main page.  
No problem. The archives are going to look a bit messy but at least we'll have a record of them.   Talk 
I care not about the mess.  Thanks.  I have a few images up, more coming but I have to get back on the road!  By the way, I saw a source that said that the 1968 AFL championship was to be played at the East Division Champ.  Alternating divisions.  The NFL did something similar for many years.  
I had a bit of a laugh out of this (snatched it off a 1962 ticket order form).  Ample restrooms?  I guess they were counting the ramps.  
Ha!   Talk 
I put a mention of ample restrooms in the image caption in the History article, and Jets fans should get a good laugh.  Images are up, I stopped because I did not want to crowd the article.  I'll keep uploading later.  I will substitute in the Namath shot, unless you have a better idea (from the four page newsletter, Jet Stream they used to send to season ticket holders, I think they did so into my tenure as a season ticket holder (since 1986).  
You have built up a very impressive collection and the article looks great! The images will help make it easier on the eyes for sure. The Namath shot is fine besides, he was an important part of the team's success and should be depicted. Some brief thoughts: After this season we'll have to re-visit the article and, in all liklihood, split it at the 90s, I would say. I'm still determined to capture the elusive photo of Rex in his element as I return to Foxboro in October, here's hoping my camera will function properly so we could add that to the article. We may also be able to grab something from the Commons for Sanchez if I can't capture him either.   Talk 
I was thinking about a split at 1969, right after the blockquote I just added.  The AFL material is more detailed.  Next time I go to a day game I'll bring my camera.  Maybe even a night.  
That's a good idea actually. Makes the most sense.   Talk

Please tell me which point is the one that you think that aplies here.

As other editors have been trying to explain to you, we have no need for an enormous diagram of disproportionate size, particularly when it appears to be copyrighted, and it is not properly sourced by using a spamlink to a commercial site.  Please read WP:NOADS and take further discussion to the article talk page.  (talk) 

I removed the diagram again...it was taking up way too much space and looked copy-pasted from somewhere else.  (Neigh) White Arabian mare

Let's take this to the article talk page, or that of the user.  (talk) 

Hi,

I will address what you said:

1. You are using a copyrighted image: I Have permission to use it. Also there is no copyright over the image (in fact, I will citate you: """"it appears to be copyrighted"""")
2.You are using a for-profit betting site as a source: There is a lot of for-profit betting sites as resources. In fact many of the big bookmakers have their own article in Wikipedia: William Hill (bookmaker). As you may know, they are legal companies (you might like them or not, but that is your personal issue)
4. and the material is not necessary for the article: The material is just for the article. Is the race course of the race.....

If the issue is the image size, we can talk about that, but the issue seems different here.

The other editor didn't explain to me anything. Just remove the material. 

Please, just objective facts, not a lot of: appears to, seems to, intention to.

Is there any big editor's authority? I think that this exceeds already the common sense.

  Sebastiansta

You uploaded the image as your own work, that alone qualifies as a copyright violation; only the owner of the image has the authority to release copyright, via the WP:OTRS system.  It is irrelevant that William Hill has a WP article, it does not make their web page a reliable source for info about the track, and furthermore, that information is more appropriate for the article about the track, not this race.  The """"big editor authority"""" are the policies and guidelines of wikipedia that I have already posted to you at your talk page.  The image is out and the text you tried to add (which is also close to a copyvio because you've pretty much just rephrased what is said at the link you cited) is also out.  Furthermore, as your primary edits seem to be to the William Hill page and this one, I suspect you also work for that company and may therefore fall under the conflict of interest rules here or are engaging in paid advocacy, which is also subject to restrictions, noted here:  WP:COIPAYDISCLOSE.  Now, please drop the issue; two experienced editors have told you this is not permissible and why - repeatedly.  (talk) """,0

Here's my five cents: I do not think it is practical to give coords for a middle point of Routes. I have looked around a bit and the only place I happened to find such coords is in Bundesautobahn 2. In this example there is an important junction in a city near the centre, so it makes sense, but in some Routes like Route 10 which consist of 3 or more separate fragments, defining any """"central"""" point on them is too arbitrary. Also some routes are important and wide for a part of their length only, so their """"middle"""" is not anything to go by. I would be happy with 2 points, but I know this is not practical in searching. I think an important destination (city or big town) somewhere between 1/3 and 2/3 of their length should be picked. But cases like Route 10 need more coords, maybe inline.  Talk """,0

My apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above. I have re-read it and can still find none. You """"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study"""", while I believe that """"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead"""". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.
As to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.
On the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.
More directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a """"star polygon"""", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a """"simple polygon"""". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as """"simple"""" or """"convex"""" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person's preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.
With that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34""",0

""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about",0

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""".

"This needs clarification, OCD is classified as GAD and its treatment is in most cases SSRI used in combination or alone to CBT, on the other hand, when anxiety doesn't appear to have sign of obsessive or compulsive behavior anxiolytic agents are tried, but due to the dependence and the need to increase the dosage, CBT is favoured. But those are not the only treatment, in some cases, when in cases of severe social-phobia, uncontrolable depersonalization/derealization and the patient doesn't respond, atypical anti-psychotics at lower dosage might be tried.

True Trips. But User:Zara1709 is appearently from germany, a country with significant nationalism and holocaust history. These guys usually blame all others to be nationalists.

So i will shrink the """"opinion"""" of Zara to the 3 real points, which were made:
The significant rising of hinduism in 4th century AD. instead of 2nd c. BC
content about buddhism-related stuff were deleted
Asoka's """"character change"""" from converted buddhist to buddhist patronizer

1.) The gupta's were the once, who made hinduism established in northern india. This was done by patronizing the Sanskrit language. Previous religions got lesser attention since then. Gupta's were the Hindu patronizers. So this is the time of the rise of """"modern Hinduism"""" in India, which took place til the use of Sanskrit language was minimized in the later middle ages due to persian and other ethnicity's rulers.
2.) This article should present the History of Hinduism, NOT the """"history of buddhism"""", or the """"history of buddhism in India"""". Therefore very special related buddhism stuff were removed. I didn't look at the muslim part in the article so far, but it should be done either way.
3.) Of course Asoka was once converted to buddhism. But since then he had sent his buddhist monks to all parts of his empire. He wrote his beliefs into the edicts of ashoka, which reflect his buddhist identity. He patronized buddhism. Since he was buddhist by heart, there was nothing to mention about him regarding hinduism apart of the contemporary compiled Sanskrit literature of oral tradition. I know, many indians would like to see him as hindu patronizer, but he wasn't at all. These were only the Guptas and Pallavas in ancient days.

Large parts of these points can be seen here:

 Pullback of Sections vs. Pullback of Bundles 

Actually, there is a subtle point that this article gets wrong, and in fact many books get wrong (or fail to emphasize, although I believe it's because everyone learns it this way). Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here. It's also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I'm sleeping, be my guest.

The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The """"pullback"""" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by

where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of """"duality"""" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.""",0
"Your point about lack of coverage of some of the longer term consequences occurred to me too. I find the trouble with this article is that there is such a vast amount of source material it is hard to get a good overall picture. i think it was Gordon (anyway someone I was reading recently) who made the point that had there been a real battle after Jutland this battle would have been consigned to histories inconsequential near-misses, just as with the other earlier raids. Gordon's thesis is also very much that failures at Jutland were a consequence  of systemic training failures within the British navy, which is touched on with the issue of signallling mistakes. I don't know what authors think about the efficiency of the German fleet, but the overall impression of the British one is poor. Incidentally, and while on the subject of consequences, Gordon also made the point that while there may have been deficiencies in British shells, this was also one of the explanations which Beatty et al. found acceptable to explain his inability to damage the German ships. His bigger difficulty was managing to direct them at anything other than sea. I suspect we are still propagating one of his self-defence red herings.",0
"The other ironies of mentioning the 1958 Convention include the fact that Argentina never actually ratified that convention and that even if they had, geographic proximity was not, in and of itself, considered by that convention to be grounds to claim sovereignty over an inhabited territory controlled by another state.  Otherwise Japan would be part of Russia and Malta would be part of Italy and Sri Lanka would be part of India and so on through literally dozens of examples.  It's such a bad argument legally that I was concerned when it went in that including it might appear to discredit the Argentine position.  But if it is an argument made by Argentina and her supporters then it belongs.

As a general rule, you can accept or refuse a proposal, but you may also make a counterproposal to improve the article.  It's not a flat yes or no, otherwise things would never improve.  For my part, I gave my position on the map above:

I oppose any attempt to map the countries that support one side or other, as this is very difficult to get a clear position on.  But this is not such a map.

 Thanks for the compliment! It's true, content is my main passion. I am happiest when doing lots of content creation/editing and community building, and I believe I do my best work when happy, and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. I tend to go through cycles in my editing. Recently, there's been a great deal of content creation that interests me, so that's what I've been most focused on. (A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders, which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community.) When I get less inspired on content, I tend to go on Recent changes patrol, jump into an XfD or RfA debate, etc. In my opinion, it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content, and make brief forays into administrative duties. I recognize that some hold differing views; to them I would say, it's essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use, other projects like Commons and Wikinews, deletion debates, mediation, etc. to act accordingly. I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff. I have nominated numerous articles for deletion, using speedy, PROD and AfD procedures; I don't know a good way to assess the results, but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. I do lots of vandalism reversion, and would estimate that I include subst'ed  templates about 80% of the time. I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR. I participate in CfD's and IfD's. I'm familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); I would not claim to know any by rote, but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.

 So, I would make no promises to be the most productive wielder of the mop, but I would make every effort to be well-informed and judicious in my use. I suppose my main use of the tools would to drift over to Category:Administrative backlog at the times that I presently look at recent changes, and do whatever needs doing. -  23:16, 24",0

 A philosophical story to embrace ones mind. 

The ancient Indian mathematicians were the first to discover the digit zero """"0"""" and implement it in the formation of digits. The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  """,0

The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

I myself have contributed towards helping make the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya article somewhat more readable, although I haven't yet begun the momentous task of cleaning up the """"Plot"""" section, which would involve either watching several episodes or collating sources for episode descriptions. It is something that I will try to help clean-up shortly.

However, I have rearranged the cast table once more. My reasoning for this is that the actors names have never been promoted by the channel. They have always been referred to as their characters. Visit the Star Plus website (only the characters are mentioned)... look at the opening credits (only the production team is referred to)... and look at the promotional programming such as the Star Parivaar Awards (the actors names are never mentioned, and they accept awards dressed as their characters). This does imply that the name of the character looms larger in the public consciousness than the name of the actor, no matter how frustrating it may be from an encyclopedic point-of-view. Therefore, the character name is the most relevant to readers/visitors of Wikipedia, and it is these names that should be credited first, not the actors.

We only know the names of some actors thanks to sources such as The Times of India or other websites referenced on the Saath Nibhaana Saathiya page. Let me know.

(By the way - what did you mean in your edit description, """"third grade book report""""? I don't take kindly to being insulted. I'm merely trying to make the page functional and relevant, like you, and petty insults don't help matters.)

The problem we have at the moment is that the entire section needs sourcingand while I have sources for some of it, many of these are not sources I will link to in a wiki article.  The alumni sites for example are run very well and would certainly meet sourcing requirements, but also have individuals personal information on them and I'm strongly against linking to those as sources, especially as the new website does not provide links to the alumni pages, but let's alumni voluntarily provide information about themselves.
I had planned to go up the school at somepoint soon and use the library copies of old yearbooks and check and cite thoseI also think that the school does have alumni information, I'm just wrong about where it is kept.
But from what I could find on Megan Follows didn't give me any reason to remove it that I didn't have for every other alumni who isn't cited.
I also think that removing all alumni who are redlinked is a bad idea.  A redlink is a tip-off that it should be looked into, but redlinks are one of the ways that people know that something hasn't been written about and they do it.

I'll confess to being a bit lost among these theological discussions. I can say that we should include all significant points of view, even Geaves'. If some say that Rawat had a Sant Mat lineage, while other say he had an Advait Mat or Radhasoami lineage, then all of those views should be included, in proportion to their prominence, and we shouldn't take sides either directly or by implication. Note that each of those linked topics has an article of its own, so we don't need to discuss them at length in this article. Anything we do say about them should be relevant to Rawat himself. 
More broadly, I'd remind everyone that we have an entire article devoted to Rawat's teachings, Teachings of Prem Rawat. The material in this article should simply be a summary of that article. Since the introductory section of that article should also summarize that article, in an ideal world we could simply copy to the intro here as a summary. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world. That article has needed work for years, but there hasn't been any significant editing there in the past year. May I suggest moving this discussion to that talk page?     talk   """,0

If you are really a very active Jew, then you would know that the Name itself is never pronounced aloud, and that the Hebrew letters that comprise it could possibly be the literal spelling of neither """"Adonai"""" nor """"haShem"""".

First of all, let me answer your tag, that is removed by me.

WP:Policy

Fairness of tone
If we're going to characterize disputes neutrally, we should present competing views with a consistently fair and sensitive tone. Many articles end up as partisan commentary even while presenting both points of view. Even when a topic is presented in terms of facts rather than opinion, an article can still radiate an implied stance through either selection of which facts to present, or more subtly their organization — for instance, refuting opposing views as one goes along makes them look a lot worse than collecting them in an opinions-of-opponents section.

We should, instead, write articles with the tone that all positions presented are at least plausible, bearing in mind the important qualification about extreme minority views. Let's present all significant, competing views sympathetically. We can write with the attitude that such-and-such is a good idea, except that, in the view of some detractors, the supporters of said view overlooked such-and-such a detail.

Now let me mention one thing to you;

"""

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0

Apart from that, your additions phrases such as """"let's just say"""", use """"you"""" to address the reader, and have """"weasel words"""" such as """"everybody says"""".  This creates a tone that is completely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article.  Also, there are numerous spelling and grammar errors as well.

I have been out most of the day and have reviewed what's gone on here on this site since I have been out with my wife and son.  I have asked Marty (mmartin) to cease in posting me to this section or this article, and to be honest, while it strokes my ego a great deal, I cannot support a sewer site like this one based upon what I have seen go on here.  I am a member of the Nation but I am not going to post private information to this site, or allow  this """"lynch mob"""" mentality to go on here, nor do I have to image my tribal card and post it to the internet to satisfy some anonymous poster from Australia.  I have had several conversations over the past week with user:Jimbo_Wales about the activities that go on with this site, and at this point, I am going to recommend to Dr. Delso at the Cherokee Nation education department at the Nation that I cease my support of this site.  I had intended and begun a full tutorial on our language and had already begun it with the translations and cultural information section.  In short, user:Jimbo_Wales WORD IS NO GOOD and he is a LIAR.  He gave me his assurances that these types of attacks would not go on here, but what has happened in the SCOX message board has basically moved to this site and have continued their stalking and harrassment and it has continued unabated.  At this point, this in not constructive for my people or my culture to support an organization that simply allows """"thundering herd"""" libel and personal attacks on individuals, reverts and defacement of information, and the so-called """"admins"""" of this site are just as immature, if not more so, than the persons engaging in libel.  As such, I am reverting and removing and marking for deletion all content I have contributed to date.  I have been very unimpressed with the people on this site running it.  It appears to be a group of immature high schoolers and college graduates who cannot tell the difference between adults and children.

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.
Many thanks indeed for your messsage. My friendly advice would be to carefully see before any blatant reverts in future. cheers. Talk """,0
"""

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

What is special about the present time? A networked society that can easily share opinions and access re",0

"""

Follow-up.

You reduce """"false rape"""" claims to people (women) changing their minds. But if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. Cooperation does not imply consent. And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. Don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?

I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, I am aware of that. What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. If rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.

I am not familiar enough with the example of South Africa that you bring up. From experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.

You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of """"sex by force"""". You have some pretty messed up ideas. Drugs are force. For example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as """"non-lethal force"""". Similiar to another example, where people are """"just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you"""" - holding someone down - by force - is force. Locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).

The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. As for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - I've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. So, women have an easier time to carry guns. 

God, I want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. But then again, it looks like total ass.

Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.""",0
"Gen Y begins in 1978 

Gen Y definitely begins in 1978. A previous author was right when she mentioned that people born in that era (1978-1984) are pretty in between, the same way people born in the early 1960s are between the classic generation X and the classic baby boom.

I think there is a difference between early Generation Yers (1978-1984) and late Generation Yers (1985-1994) but I don't think people born after about 1993 or 1994 can be included in Generation Y. Part of being Gen Y is being a child of a baby boomer. My parents were born in 1955 and I was born in 1990. The baby boomers are a pretty unified generation, and even my parents consider themselves to be part of a different generation than people born in the 1940s. My parents are children of the '70s, Watergate era, and came of age as adults during the late 1970s and early 1980s yuppie/disco era. Meanwhile, someone born in 1946 remembers the conformity of the 1960s and was in high school as opposed to grade school during the JFK assassination, and could have been drafted for Vietnam. They were old enough to take part in the antiwar protests or go to Woodstock. After about 1954 the boomers were children of the '70s, while before they were children of the '60s.

The same distinction exists between early and late Y. Early Y is a transitional group between Generation X and Generation Y, and their coming-of-age was characterized by alot of change (PCs, etc.) Also, their parents included more Vietnam vets and protestors, and hippies, while most people my age have parents whose adolescent preoccupations were disco and Led Zeppelin-type rock, Watergate and the oil crisis.

I really don't think most people in Gen X would be too comfortable with people who were little kids in the '80s being in their generation. Being an adolescent in the 1980s is a Generation X requirement.",0

"PROBLEMS ON KURDISH ARTICLES

First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  
It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. 

Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. 

As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”

The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. 

I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental...

"The Malvern Water cure
For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. 

There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.

The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow",0

User:Linnwood may be a minor child

I have reason to believe that User:Linnwood is a minor child.  I asked him, and he refused to answer.  See my talk and his.  He was belligerent, I was not.  Virtually no adult would have trouble confirming adult status, at least.  I can understand asking age would be different, though, as it is sensitive and sometimes used for ID purposes.  Since User:Linnwood is quite possibly a child, discussing this article with him or, indeed, any sexual matter may be illegal depending on jurisdiction and may subject the user to prosecution and registry as a sexual offender.

Mastic finds one of its uses in drying-oil type varnishes incorporating, for example, linseed oil. Mastic is not soluble in water; in fact, a small piece of it makes a long-lasting chewing gum.

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. 

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol).

These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved. But I can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s process.Wm5200 (talk)'""""
