Thanks Flyer22 that was not my guess.  Here's what the NBC website says, the official site, not a message board: Lucas was injured when a beam fell on his legs and EJ agreed to save Lucas only if Sami agrees to let EJ have his way with her. Sami reluctantly had sex with EJ and helped him escape to Mexico, after he was wanted in connection with the shooting of John Black. Despite Sami’s attempt to turn over a new leaf, EJ returned and pressed her for information on police activities, and she was pulled into another web of deception, trying to prevent him from learning she was pregnant. That's from Sami Brady.  That tells me the show's official position is that she agreed.  What a character says and what the show's position is in this case are not the same.  Since Ed Scott took over, only Lucas has used the word and Sami and EJ have shared a couple of kisses as well as reading the Santo and Colleen letters together. It has been indicated they are going to """"tighten things up"""" and fill in some wholes. The anticipation by some fans (I know, there's that """"some"""" word but that is the case with people I have encountered) is that the December 29th issue will be resolved soon.   """,0

At first pass, this looks quite good. It's comprehensive, well sourced, and well written, and seems generally ripe for promotion. I've made a few tweaks as I went; feel free to revert any with which you disagree.

Here are a few quibbles that I couldn't immediately resolve myself:

I'd suggest splitting the lead into two paragraphs for readabilityperhaps at """"Increased expenses and decreasing ridership""""?
""""with two railroad stations in operation, one on the C&O; line and the Union Station just west of the C&O; station at the junction between the C&O; and Southern railroads""""  I found this part of the sentence hard to follow at first glance; maybe break this off as a second sentence: """"two railroad stations in operation. One was on the C&O; line, and the second, the Union Station, was just west..."""" Am I understanding the meaning correctly in this rewrite?
""""Development of the streetcar system""""  I'd suggest breaking this long paragraph into at least two for readability (Perhaps at """"this continued until..."""")
Route Description  split large paragraph for readability
Two statements here that it would be better to fix in time per WP:REALTIME for clarity in the long-term:
To address these issues, the city has begun planning and analyzing various methods of public transportation for implementation within Charlottesville, one of which includes the development of a streetcar system. (""""in the early 2000s, the city began..."""")

That's because there definately isn't one. I wouldn't be surprised if Jesus's name is a taboo in Jewish culture though.

 """"Just as Koch inherited his oil business from his father, Americans for Prosperity borrows from the ultra-right group also founded in part by his dad, the John Birch Society.

Conceived by Robert Welch and a small group of conservative industrialists, including Fred Koch - David's father and the namesake of the family firm of Koch Industries - the John Birch Society cloaked its pro-business, anti-civil rights agenda in the rhetoric of the Cold War.
...
Cushioned with large donations from Koch and others, the Birch Society helped propel Barry Goldwater to the Republican nomination in 1964 and helped Republicans make gains in the congressional midterms of 1966.

Like Americans for Prosperity, the John Birch Society rarely acknowledged its funding from the very rich. Instead, it depicted itself as a citizens group merely interested in American ideals of freedom. Rather than argue the policy nuances of entitlement programs or new regulations, the Birch Society marshaled opposition by depicting progressive reform as capitulation to the Soviet Union. In that polarized environment, the interests of millionaires suddenly became aligned with patriotic families who wanted to do their part against the communist threat.

Shortly after the Birch Society faded, David Koch founded Americans for Prosperity in 1984 (then known as Citizens for a Sound Economy)."""" author=Berkowitz, Bill | location=Oakland, CA}}

 """"Fred Koch was a founder of the John Birch Society , a coven of anti-communists and intellectual louts. The Koch brothers' success allows them to further their father's work: They know well what money is, how to make it and what it can do when focused on ruthless ideology.""""
 """"David and Charles had absorbed their fathers conservative politics and adopted the John Birch Societies interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market ideals. They were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of The Road to Serfdom(1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism.""""
 """"For decades, the Koch brothers, billionaire heirs of one of the largest privately held companies in the United States, have covertly sought to promote their hard-right ideology through third parties, think tanks, foundations and front groups.

Shannon's Editing Comments:

Hello  I loved your beginning section on social support and found the definition of social support to be very helpful in my understanding. However, your second paragraph was a little too wordy for my liking and difficult to remain interested. Also, in your third paragraph """"with these types of communication.."""" you did not mention any types of communication before, and therefore you cannot use these, until after explaining each type of communication.  Finally, I would suggested maybe making your points in your verbal/non-verbal method section bulleted. Overall, you added great information to our article, take my suggestions as you wish.   

Hello  You added some great information, I am just concerned that it is all from one source, or have you not quite finished adding your additional citations? I really love your choice of bolding and italicizing your guidelines, however guideline three is not separate from guideline two, nor is it bold/italic. Finally there us a Which, in your final guildline that should not be capitalized. Great work Meagan, take my advice as you wish.   

Hello  You have made some great additions to our article, especially the use of the General Adaptive Syndrome. However, in stage three, stressor is missing a letter (small typo). You had a great point of how inadequate sleep leads to irritability, however, I suggest that you change """"less inclined to communicate"""" to less inclined to communicate effectively. Also, in your section of language barrier, you used the word intercultural, I believe interlingual is a more suitable term as culture is not only defined by language. For instance citizens of Quebec, have Canadian culture despite speaking a different language than most Canadians. Finally, the point on imaginary friend, might be a little far-fetched, but it would be fine to leave if you see fit. Great work overall!   

Thanks for the tips Shannon. I used them all! The interlingual suggestions was perfect!   23:""",0

REVISED UPDATE: As far as I can tell, """"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"""" does not now appear on any list of anthems, national or otherwise. The links given above take you to List of anthems of UN member states, which has no mention of it, or National anthem, which has this little gem:
===For parts of states===
The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, amongst others, are notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" and these songs may be officially recognized.
14 of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union had their own official song which was used at events connected to that republic. The Russian republic used the USSR's national anthem. Some republics retained the melodies of those songs after the dissolution of the USSR (see the article National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics).
The United Kingdom's national anthem is """"God Save the Queen"""" but its constituent countries also have their own anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a number of songs which may be played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. The song usually played for England is """"God Save the Queen"""", though sometimes Jerusalem and Land of Hope and Glory may be played instead. Scotland has relatively recently adopted Flower of Scotland as its unofficial National Anthem, while Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century. Northern Ireland too has traditionally used """"God Save the Queen"""" though Londonderry Air is also used.
""""Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century"""", which is pretty good going - was it non-stop? No mention of the term """"national anthem"""" and the wording of the intro - notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" - plus the section heading """"parts of states"""" - clearly downgrades the status of Wales (and others). But my main concern is that our national anthem gets no recognition on a list, unless I've missed it; nothing showed on 'what links here'.   22:55, 4 September 2009""",0

 General update 

I've expanded the article in general and corrected some of the English, namely some literal translations and """"false friends"""". For example, it was written that Castelao was an """"universalist"""", when Universalism in English is a religion (wiki it ;)). The correct translation from the Galician universalista / universalismo when speaking about politics is """"internationalist / internationalism"""", and so on.

Also, I have serious doubts about what's said in reference to the translations of his works... Only a handful of his short stories are translated into English as far as I know, and I don't think there's many translations around in other languages.

"""

Let us examine what is considered """"Black"""" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:

""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""

This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)

I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: 

Ephraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.

Simon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas """"Black Jews of Ethiopia"""". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1

Here's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)

Rebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns

""""The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa""""

""""She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”

Hedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.

The Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.""""

I would say that makes Ethiopian Jew's a valid part of this article.

"Lao vs. Laotian in English

In the Lao language (and as well as in Isan—which Isan people also call LAO—and the Thai language), 'LAO' (ລາວ) can mean someone that is from the Lao People's Democratic Republic of Laos, as well as specifically ethnic Lao people (which excludes the Hmong, Khmu and others) or all people of Laos (which includes the Hmong, Khmu and others).  Isan people use 'LAO' to also refer to themselves and their language since most Isan people descend from Lao people from Vientiane, Champassak, Louang Phrabang, and other areas that are now in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.  Since this article is in ENGLISH (ພາສາອັງກິດ), English-language conventions should be used.  'LAO' in English ONLY refers to the ethnic Lao people and DOES NOT INCLUDE the Hmong, Khmu and other minorities that live in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
Use of Laotian
'LAOTIAN' = ຄົນທີ່ມາຈາກສາທາລະນະລັດປະຊາທິປະໄຕປະຊາຊົນລາວ)
'LAOTIAN' means anything that has to do with the country of Laos as a whole.  'LAOTIAN' as a term in English INCLUDES the Hmong, Khmu, and other people that currently live in Laos and have Laotian citizenship.  If someone want to specifically refer to people (of any ethnic background) of Laos, 'LAOTIAN' should be used.

Lao including/excluding Isan
There seems to be no consensus on whether or not Isan are Lao people.  But other articles on Wikipedia seem to not differentiate this nationality vs. ethnicity debate.  

There are Swiss-Italian people, i.e., people who are ethnically Italian but live in Switzerland (not Italy).  The article about the Italian people includes Italian-Americans, Swiss-Italians, and many other people of Italian descent besides those in Italy. Obviously those in Switzerland do not have any allegiance to the Italian Government, but it does not diminish their Italianess.  The ethnic Germans can be found across Europe, and many outside of Germany, but these people are ethnic Germans, identify as such, and most likely, have no allegiance to Germany.  

The easiest solution, given how the English language works:  Make one page Laotian People (anyone from Laos, excluding Isan people and others) and make one page for Lao People, which includes Isan people.  Political allegiance to the Thai king does not mean that Isan people stopped eating sticky rice, listening to morlam, believe in Phaya Nak, celebrate Boun Phra Vet, think the Mekong River is sacred, or refer to themselves as Lao.  And Isan people have not stopped speaking the Lao language, it just got a name change.  The Isan language article has been vandalised, so to speak, with someone changing 'Isan' to 'Isan Lao'—most likely by a Lao person—since this nomenclature is absent in the speech of Isan people, who refer to themselves as 'Lao' or 'Isan' or 'Thai Isan'.  There is confusion between Thai and Lao culture, because it is almost the SAME!  Just like it's hard to tell Canadians and Americans apart, because, with the exclusion of the Québecois, people in Canada and America have the same culture, language, and share a border.  Laos and Thailand are no different.  The only thing that prevented Laos from being part of Thailand is the French, and the French are also the only ones that made the Isan people Thai, i.e., part of the Thai nation, but even the French were unable to stop Lao and Isan people from being a common people.  Isan was part of Lanxang just like Laos is, so both groups can claim access to the same heritage, influences, and what not.  Lao people make up only 50% of the population, in Isan, Lao speakers make up 88% of the region, so it is more homogenously 'Lao' than all of Laos!  Blame the French for the uneven distribution of the Lao people, but yes.  The Central Thai, i.e., Bangkok people and People of the Chao Phraya River valley, have worked very hard to integrate Isan into Thailand and claim Isan culture (which is Lao) as part of its cultural milieu.  There are also Lao that claim that the Thais have stolen from Lao culture, but since Thai and Lao (and Isan) are all descended from the same Tai peoples, of course there are similarities.  There were even Isan communists supporting integration of Isan into Laos up until the 1980s.  If the Isan people are not going to be listed as 'Lao People' than the following 'Lao' people should be removed because they are Isan by birth:
 ຫຼວງປູ່ມັ່ນ ພູຣິທັຕໂຕ Mun Bhuridatta, born in Ubon Ratchathani Province (I'm pretty sure this is Isan).
 ໜູຮັກ ພູມສະຫວັນ Nouhak Phoumsavanh, born in Mukdahan Province (again Isan).

 Waterfalls 
Hamilton looks like an impressive place for waterfalls.  I""""ll certainly have to include it in my list of places to visit.  I can't speak for any of the areas in the Pacific Northwest (which is home to hundreds of high, impressive falls), in North Carolina, according to Kevin Adams' """"North Carolina Waterfalls: A Hiking and Photography Guide"""", our state is estimated to have around 1,000 - 1,500 falls in the state, most of them in Transylvania County, NC (aka """"The Land of Waterfalls"""").  Estimates are that TC contains between 400-500 """"major"""" waterfalls in an area slightly smaller than the City of Hamilton (390 sq mi versus Hamilton's 439 sq mi).  As for what you call """"major"""" - that's pretty much up to the viewer.  One man's gushing torrent is another man's damp spot on the side of a rock.  In TC, a major waterfall is usually considered at least 15-20' high - not including talus - or having enough current to be an obvious waterfall (such as Hooker Falls).

If you ever get the chance to visit NC, please do.  We've got a lot of beautiful, rugged country.  To this day, I get reports about new waterfalls discovered by people who are just now able to scamper through some of the roughest terrain the east coast has to offer.    

Part of the problem with defining the """"City with the most waterfalls"""" is that neither term is overly well defined.  """"City"""" can mean """"town limits"""" or """"Metropolitan Area"""" or any other of a dozen different definitions.  Then you have the problem with the exact definition of a waterfall.  Ergo, you have the problem.

I don't know of another town with that many waterfalls.  However I do know that when it rains really heavily the valley that you walk up first on the Milford Track, has over 300 waterfalls. -

Regarding the 100 waterfalls Hamilton, I am unaware of another city area with that many.  There are probably """"areas"""" with about that much, such as the Columbia River Gorge, but the exact number there I am ignorant of and they are not that many major ones.  Here on the Olympic Peninsula we have a number of falls, but it is a really large area and probably does not reach the density that you have indicated there in Hamilton.  However it must be noted that I am a amateur at this and am ignorant of much

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

 Yet my last sentence in my foregoing post is perfectly veridical. Even now Jeffro77 (and you) are unaware of the illiterate nature of his edit even though I reproduced it for him (from the """"Existence of God"""" Talk page): """"The Deutsch citation is entirely correct, and the quoted text is available at the linked article in the citation. Failing to use the exact citation supplied by you is immaterial."""" But as anyone who is literate can see, his citation is incorrect: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""".

 """"Chapter 14"""" of what book? By whom?

 Nor did I ever call anyone at Wikipedia a bully. That's a false claim by you. You therein protest too much (cf. Hamlet, Act III, Scene II, line 240).

 As well, I don't merely make charges, I prove what I state. Jeffro77 and Ilkali both repeatedly made false claims regarding the subject for which there is no excuse due to the information being readily at hand within either the subsection under question itself or in the hyperlinked Wikipedia articles. Neither of them knew the slightest thing about the Omega Point Theory other than that they knew that its author maintains that it physically proves God's existence, which was all it took to rile them up. While lacking knowledge about a subject is not itself an error, what is completely uncalled for is to have vociferous opinions on an issue while remaining in that state of ignorance.

 That's the current state of this matter. Those who have repeatedly shown a willingness to make factually false statements on the matter, and whose ignorance regarding the subject is nearly complete, now have their illiterate and clownishly censorial, and indeed illogical, edit showing.

 Regarding the illogic of the edit, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he deleted mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by Jeffro77's own words, he must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

 Jeffro77's edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that it's a sick joke.74.4.222.208  """,0

"""== Audio File ==

DCGeist is vandalising this article by repeatedly removing content while refusing to exaplin the problem or start a discussion to correct the problem.  The problem, he says, is """"style"""", which he believes """"very clearly explains the problem"""".  He prefers to delete content rather than help to edit the page to allow its inclusion.  Is United States to be the only country in the Western Hemisphere without an audio file for pronunciation of the name? 

When did """"style"""" become so important that it justifies the deletion of content over style correction?   

The addition is ungrammatical.
It clutters the article's opening sentence. It is visually off-putting and difficult to read. This is a very significant stylistic concern; by contrast, the addition of an audio clip pronouncing two common English words is a minor and unnecessary matter of content.—  

 Could you explain why you think the addition is ungrammatical in the parenthetical comment?  Do you have a proposed solution that will avoid deleting content, or is deleting content your purpose?  The opening can be reworded, rather than deleting content.  Please note that the pronunciation, even of """"common"""" words in English is of value to both non-native speakers as well as native-born speakers, since even common words may change pronunciation within a proper name.  Please justify having only one country in North America whose article is forbidden to contain an audio file.   

While remaining mostly neutral on this front, please don't call something """"vandalism"""" when it's not. This is a disagreement, and under the terms of """"Bold, Revert, Discuss"""", the onus is actually now upon you to justify its inclusion, not the other way around. But either way, it's not obvious vandalism. It annoys admins when people throw that term around. Or at least me. And as for """"Is United States to be the only country in the western hemisphere"""", I point out that """"United States"""" is the only country name in the Western hemisphere made up entirely of common words, without proper names. (""""of America"""" is different, of course, but the audio file isn't about that name) So there is an argument to say that it is the country least in need of a pronunciation guide, since there's no unusual or proper words in that particular name.

"Well thank you for finally having the courtesy to participate in the discussion. In response. 1)Yes, I agree that there is a perception of overlap between ALSF, the yl's and so forth. This perception however is an inaccurate one. One only need do factiva searches on the hostility between alsf and the yl's in the 1980's and 1990's for instance. Indeed in some states liberal students and young liberals have nothign to do with each other still. In contrast to the YL's, the ALSF is not considered part of the Liberal Party, and the party has no authority over it. If you have any suggestions as to how I can make this clearer on the ALSF page, I shall be more than happy to take this on board. 2)Stating that the YL's and Liberal Students in NSW have worked together and held joint functions does nothing to counteract what i just said.

There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of """"plus or minus"""" 
and why he chose """"Smoot's Ear"""" for his title:
http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N43/smoot.html
This is an account by Marie Y. Thibault of Tavernor's speech at MIT 
about his book, with Smoot in attendance.

Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning 
Smoot's Ear and """"plus or minus"""".
Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title.
Both open with """"+ 1 ear"""".
It's presented by Tavernor as the historical basis, i.e., the 
historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque, and the 
decades of paint on the bridge.
Both derive """"plus or minus"""" from """"+ 1 ear"""".
Neither states that the historical measurement was """"plus or minus"""". 
Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor 'The significance of
Smoot’s Ear is that is stands for an approximation, a “plus or
minus”'.
""""Smoot's Ear"""" is a component of the historical measurement,
""""+ 1 ear"""".
""""stands for"""" is clearly not an historical recounting,
but a reference to Tavernor's interpretation.
He's distinguishing the earlier """"Ear"""" from his contribution,
""""plus or minus"""".

If """"plus or minus"""" were already part of the historical record, it
wouldn't be necessary or desirable to begin with """"+ 1 ear"""".

""""Plus or minus"""" was not part of the historical record, it was
introduced (for purposes of this discussion) by Tavernor as
his interpretation, not part of the historical record.   
Tavernor's account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of 
these points than the Preface, but both seem to achieve the same 
basic end, explaining how the """"ear"""" in """"+ 1 ear"""" from the
measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book, beginning
with """"plus or minus"""", i.e., uncertainty.

Tavernor isn't trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge,
nor measured on the bridge,
quite the contrary, that he took this human measurement, with a
component obviously intended to provoke, inter alia, the notion
of uncertainty, and related it to the whole history of
measurement and made a book of it.

It doesn't matter how many times Tavernor says
the bridge measures 364.4 Smoots plus/minus an Ear.
He could say it 300 times.
He might even say the length of the bridge is 360
Smoots plus or minus an ear.
That has its own truth.
These are only a couple of simple derivative forms 
out of a host of possible derivative forms.
From what are they derived?
Tavernor tells us.
He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with
the historical measurement, 364.4 smoots + 1 ear.

Tavernor's first reference citation within his book, for the 
Preface, which certainly seems to be the one he considers most
important, is to what he calls a corroborating interview 
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5043041
That's the one I quoted earlier 
[ 2005-12-07 ]
""""Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if it's measured in smoots?""""
Mr. SMOOT [himself]: 
""""Three hundred and sixty-four point four, plus one ear.""""
It'd be pretty incongruous to argue that he found """"plus or minus""""
there.
Also, he repeatedly cites WP, which at the time, didn't have
""""plus or minus"""".
Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being
put forward to re-write history, that he was 
not well situated to know about this, he does make it clear 
that he carefully checked into the bridge.
He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who
happens to be in a Dept. of Sociology, who wrote a book that 
seems to be a good read.

Tavernor's Preface was cited on the 
morning of New Year's Day, 2008, as support for the edit of 
Smoot to add ±, but the Preface actually refutes the 
edit by its reference to + 1 ear.
± didn't arise on the bridge; it showed up in Tavernor's
Preface.
Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect.

If no one can say what from Tavernor's Preface seems to a) conform 
to WP:NOR and b) support the current language of the 5 
articles, then, yes, this would be an excellent time to revert to

 Nationality 

This is a complex subject. Looking at the definition of nationality on the wiki page, it opens with the line """"Nationality is the legal relationship between a person and a state"""", which taken at face value would of course make Nicola Sturgeon's nationality British (just as it is the nationality of Ruth Davidson or Kezia Dugdale), with no possibility of it being Scottish since Scotland does not exist as an independent state, and being born in the UK prior to 1983 conferred British nationality (at least in the legal sense). 

In previous (rather thinly commented) discussions around SNP politicians, however, the preferred definition has instead been how people see themselves or are assumed to see themselves based on party membership. Is this really a good definition? Particularly given that there is often no actual citation given for these people seeing themselves in terms of actual nationality as Scottish only? 

When this was discussed in relation to Gerry Adams, the case for his Irish nationality rested on the fact that he has an Irish passport. Obviously in the case of Nicola Sturgeon no such passport exists. What's the real justification for giving her nationality exclusively as Scottish?   """,0

The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6, and Hamas retaliated with rockets. I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN. However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: """"Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted """"terror sites and concealed rocket launchers"""" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."""" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: """"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation.""""

PMK, first something personal - I think that I am familiar with a part of the problem. I have been in Gora (and I don't agree that they are Macedonians, Gora even is outside of the region of Macedonia), I have been in Reka, in Plasnica and Lisichani in Kichevo region (where the Turkish influence is very high) etc.
I can not accept your POV, that Pomak or other names are offensive. You should provide sources about this claim. However, let us imagine that these names are offensive - look the text in the article after Torbeš: (the latter name is slightly pejorative). What exactly is the problem to make such formulation for the other alternative names?
The term """"Pomak"""" is exonim for more of these communities. Pomak was accepted only from some Slavspeaking Muslims in Tikvesh and in Aegean Macedonoia, but now the biggest part these communities are displaced from the region of Macedonia. This was one of the reasons for my proposal for a compromise, when I added """"in historical context"""". However, I'll repeat that for all of three alternative names we have a serious scholar reference.
I think that it is good idea to add """"Apovci"""" as a regional name of one of this community.
If you have a relevant reference, that the term """"Tatars"""" has such status for Bulgarians (as Pomaks, Bulgarian Pomaks and Bulgarian Muslims for the object of this article), we can discuss it. We both know that the term """"Tatars"""" for Bulgarians is only propaganda, but if you'll find reliable sources for other uses of this term, we can examine them. Until then, the alternative name of the Macedonian Muslims and your analogy will remain incomparable.  """,0

"""For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.

The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:
""""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. 

The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, """"The Living Legend,"""" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.

Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.

Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""

In the last month (and excepting my message this afternoon), I have on one (1) occasion interacted with Heymid. I told him that instead of just removing information that has a clear, explicit source, it would be better to explain why in the talk page for the concerned article, then wait for others so get a chance to respond.

During October, Heymid was blocked a third or fourth time for, well, doing what he always has and probably always will since he gets away with it. He appealed this block, the appeal was denied, then he appealed again, promising pretty much the same stuff he had promised when trying to have previous blocks lifted. I wrote nothing when he was blocked, nothing when he first appealed, nothing when the first appeal was denied, nothing when he appealed again and nothing when he was unblocked. Yet you feel that I'm popping up at every venue, and when I did write a single message at somebody else's talk page, you immediately blocked me, without any warning, without any message in my talk page.

Speedy deletion of The Wrong Trousers (Band)
 A tag has been placed on The Wrong Trousers (Band) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

"The text of the article could have been taken from Tudjman era Croatian propaganda press. The consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality, or revalue the widely accepted view of Croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased. Some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing (particularly the plight of the city's inhabitants of Serbian nationality - about half of the total number - in the city subject to Croatian military rule, or the very existence thereof) parts of the text are clearly self-contradictory (the Croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed, yet they still manage to down 20 warplanes) and full of dubious propaganda cliches (the backbone of JNA was broken at Vukovar). One does not need to be an expert on war in the Balkans to note these shortcomings. Naturally, this does not mean that we should subscribe to the Serbian propaganda of the time - an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from ICTY proceedings, from well known western reporters present at or near the scene (Misha Glenny), and from other sources.

Thanks for the support... by the time you added that comment I'd changed the tautology para, and removed all the others so I'm not clear which """"current"""" para you mean. Quite a lot of consilidation done tonight; I'm much happier with the current text than before. From my POV the main remaining problem is the lead paragraph which I hope the current text demonstates is seriously misleading. Here is my proposed new version:

In physics and cosmology, the anthropic principle was originally the rule of reasoning that we should take account of the constraints that our existence as observers imposes on the sort of universe that we could observe. The term has since been extended to cover supposed """"superlaws"""" that in various ways require the universe to support intelligent life, usually assumed to be carbon-based, and occasionally to be specifically human beings. Anthropic reasoning involves assessing these constraints by analysing the properties of universes with different fundamental parameters or laws of physics from ours, and has frequently concluded that essential structures, from atomic nuclei to the whole universe, depend for stability on delicate balances between different fundamental forces; balances which only occur in a small minority of possible universes — so that ours seems to be  fine-tuned for life. Anthropic reasoning also attempts to explain and quantify this fine tuning. Within the scientific community the usual approach is to invoke selection effects from a real ensemble of alternate universes; competing strategies, occasionally also called anthropic, include intelligent Design. 
 
This would allow some shortening of the second para discussing controversies. You can see that I plan to have Anthropic reasoning re-direct to this page.  You can also see that I think we should avoid getting hung up on the tautologous nature of some statements of the AP (including the one you like), because I do think that misses the point.(c.f. new first para to the Character of Anthropic reasoning section). Oh, another proposal: merge the Bostrom section into the Variants, i.e. add his self sampling assumption as an AP-type statement. What do you think?  """,0

"Australian club notability 2 

Hey Octopus, first and foremost, awesome work on creating a table of notability for football clubs and comps. Much appreciated by all, I'm sure. =)

I'm writing this to see about . A previous user messaged you about adding the old and proposed national cups in late 2012. Since then, two major changes have occurred in Australian Football. The first is not-surprisingly the development of the FFA Cup from a proposal, to a legitimate tournament. The second change is a little more subtle, but still extremely notable. The alignment of 8 of the 9 State Leagues into a national second division.

The updated version I'm suggesting is for the A-League (1), National Soccer League (1), National Premier Leagues (8) to be deemed notable. Your previous list also mentions the Brisbane Premier League (a third division) as notable.

I was also wondering if the following third division leagues (all containing promotion spots to the National Premier Leagues competitions) could also be deemed notable:
National Premier Leagues NSW 2 (12/12 clubs within this league have articles) (Note: This is the most prestigious third division competition in Australia).
National Premier Leagues Victoria 1 (20/20 clubs within this league have articles)
National Premier Leagues State League (16/16 clubs within this league have articles)

Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to """"Principles of science"""", 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy. I think if someone would like to expand on these it would be benificial to everyone.

Hi Rockero! I just wanted to give you a big brotherly hug. You made me proud by paticipating on the May 1 march, the Great American March.

Due to things off my hands, (appointments, car broken, my neighbor is not legal so she chose not to go because Arpaio allegedly threatened to arrest illegals, only small groups gathered here) and just plain bad luck I wasn;'t able to march but I protested too, wearing White that day and resisting my ever attacking urges to shop and shop, which are like the munchies to me. Today Im already looking forward to what Im gonna buy tonight..lol!!

Anyways, banderas arriba!! We gotta peacefully fight the racists, show them we are here to stay. Spain's and Chile's consulate urged their citizens to protest, and I saw Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chilean, Venezuelan and Salvadorean flags on the march when I looked at the news.

This is not """"creative"""".  Those are the dictionary definitions of the terms """"insurance"""" and """"ensurance"""" as properly applied to """"destruction"""".  If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up """"three man cell"""" and """"bounty hunter"""" and then it will be easy to understand why """"ensured"""" and """"insured"""" are different - and why both differ from """"assured"""".

The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.  If that's my fault, fine, I can fix that to explain.  But ther'es nothing """"personal"""" or """"creative"""" about it.

I'm tired of arguing with you.  Re: the other article, """"multi-party"""" turns up plenty, and there is more use of """"mutually"""" than """"mutual"""".  If I were to apply your standard I'd be moving """"Mutual Assured Destruction"""" to """"talk"""" for not appealing to a Reagan voter's biases about its effectiveness, and for dropping the """"ly"""".

There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like """"peace movement"""" or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.  

If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks """"eye for an eye"""" describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?

Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.

This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.

If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.

If this is a history book, fine, it's a history book.  But that wasn't what it was claimed to be...

""""Moors are not a distinct or self-defined people.[5] Medieval and early modern Europeans variously applied the name to Arabs, Berbers, Muslim Europeans andSub-Saharan Africans.[6]

The Moors came from Morocco and crossed theStrait of Gibraltar to reach the Iberian Peninsula. The Moors were initially of Arab and Berberdescent at the time of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the early 8th century. Later the term covered people of mixed ancestry, and IberianChristian converts to Islam (the Arabs called the latter Muwalladun or Muladi).[7][8]

Europeans have classified a number of associated ethnic groups as """"Moors,"""" and terms for this are found in their languages. In the modern Iberian Peninsula, """"Moor"""" is sometimes colloquially used for any person from North Africa, but some people consider this use of the term pejorative.""""

 Songs and singles

I had been interested in the project and made this point there some time back but couldn't get over this stumbling block and went elsewhere.

"A few weeks ago, in anticipation of Millennium Park regaining its featured topic status, I broached the idea of CUP credit after the last article was promoted and you indicated that credit would not be granted.  It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.

The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.  Promoting two GAs and 4 FAs is more work than most people have to do to get a new FT. (T/C//WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)",0

I'm surprised this list has survived and grown, but it seems to meet some need.  Given that it appears to be here to stay, yes, some change towards sortable table would help.

There'd be columns for University, State, and NRHP name, perhaps with a """"type"""" column or with color coding for NHLs vs. regular NRHPs.  All 3 or 4 columns could be sortable.  However, some of the university historic districts listed here include sublists of contributing properties.  Not sure how those would work in a sortable table.  Mere contributing properties should not be made to appear to be equivalent in appearance to a NRHP.

The Yemen times article is full of misinformation (950 AD? Ethiopian civilization starting in 500 AD? Maybe they meant BC, but still, Ethiopian civilization is older than that. Good job on finding the link by Negash, I've seen it before and it's informative on the post-Aksumite and Zagwe period. It has nothing to do with Sheba, however, as that happened (if it even did) ca.1000-950 BC, not AD. The first one is rather odd because it's written by the same person who wrote Aksum. I can't really comment on it, but no one has ever said that D`mt was founded by Sabaeans, as it predates the Sabaean migration by a few centuries.

Spamming: Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users, or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand.
Campaigning: Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a non-neutral manner.
Vote-stacking: Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions (which may be made known by a userbox, user category, or prior statement). Vote-banking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group, similar to a political party, in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage, much as a form of prearranged vote stacking.
Stealth canvassing: Contacting users off-wiki (by e-mail, for example) to persuade them to join in discussions (unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages)
Soliciting support other than by posting direct messages, such as using a custom signature with a message promoting a specific position on any issue being discussed.

"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.

Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

Julien, there always exist contrary points of view. People still take issue with the Earth being round. But while one can have a contrary opinion, that doesn't make said opinion a fact. 

Gaywebmonkey has cited its sources  an interview with Corrigan, published comments by Cobra's attorney's, email correspondence between Corrigan and an unnamed producer, and statements by various anti-child porn groups.  The issue isn't those sources. It's the fact that you haven't provided one source for anything you've contributed to the article. 

I've changed your """"claiming"""" comments  to """"stating."""" """"Claiming"""" is far less neutral than """"stating."""" You are arguing the article was biased. I was rectifying that situation. None of which prohibits another party with knowledge of the issues in question from stating the opposite  as Cobra's attorneys have done.  But just changing """"stated"""" to """"claims"""" doesn't make something """"more"""" neutral.

Lastly, the reason why citation is so important here is to allow anyone else to backtrack and read for themselves about the issues in question. It brings a measure more of impartiality to the proceedings. The rules here are the same for you as they are for me: cite your sources.

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term.

I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

 Ed, we all have our biases, you and me both.  My concern about the article is that it needs to cover a lot of bases.

"Uncertainties and mystifications in Wikipedia's global warming articles 

Dear Encyclopaedia, thanks a lot for your offer but I am afraid that it is one that I will have to refuse because it seems as a waste of time. While I admire Wikipedia as an amazing resource that beats most classical encyclopedias on most topics, global warming is a topic where it is being made irrational by activists.

In the context of Wikipedia, the most obvious activist who makes it impossible to keep balanced and accurate articles about the climate change, its accuracy, and the certainty or uncertainty of various statements, is William M. Connolley, an official of the British Green Party. The reason why one single activist became so powerful with the topic is that he was spending hours with edit wars on Wikipedia and cared about the topic so much that despite his obvious bias and lousy scientific credentials, he became a kind of administrator on Wikipedia.

It makes almost no sense for more qualified people than himself to try to improve the articles, starting with global warming, so that they're more than mentally limited ideological booklets of the Green Party. I have given up the desire to fix this segment of Wikipedia a long time ago, and I am afraid that your request won't change anything about it. Unfortunately, similar control by incompetent and often downright dishonest people extends from Wikipedia to much more important institutions in the society, so Wikipedia's outrageous alarmist bias and misinformation about the climate is probably just the most innocent tip of this iceberg.",0
"Wizzy - you are the problem of your own creation.

See the problem is that while pushing people around and being nasty to them, might make you feel ever so important, what really happens is that all you do is make more people not like you.

There really are no bonus points to be had in being a bully who is nasty to everyone; but again you are responsible for making yourself into that kind of a person; so therefore it's a personal problem that is up to you to resolve by taking responsibility for the fact that you are choosing to be nasty to other people.

As to what you do about your problem - which is you and your attitude towards others and how you treat them; is really nothing to do with me.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

Excerpt from the book by Grateful Dead Bass Player Phil Lesh:

The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.

For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit. The process by which they become one is called bleshing, from a combination of mesh and blend. (Today’s archetype would be the X-Men.)

Now I'm going to put the page back the way it was.  And I'll add this reference to it.

Moeron, you might want to consider discussing this with us before you go ahead and try to change it again.  No one that I know of appointed you Keeper Of The Deadhead Page.",0

 Rindge article 

Hi DH,

Thanks for getting in touch about the population figure in the Rindge, New Hampshire article.  I did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you've done has been thoughtful and informative.  As I alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in New Hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it's because somebody first put in a figure and called it """"2005 Census"""".  Since there is no such thing, I consult the state Office of Energy and Planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (Concord and Peterborough are a few other places where I've had to do that.)  I can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but I also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.  Anyway, I've enjoyed watching your edits go in, and I look forward to seeing more!   """,0

 Dividing vs gerrymandering 

Although """"gerrymandering"""" may seem like a politically loaded term that violates the NPOV principle, going by the current entry on Gerrymandering, it's appropriate and does not violate NPOV: in the case brought by Dems against the GOP to fight redistricting, the Dems argued the new district lines were drawn for racially motivated reasons. The GOP argued back that it was done strictly for political gain. This is the very essence of gerrymandering, and I suggest the word can be restored, and should be, because it is more descriptive.

 Vandalism on B-theory of time 

It seems perhaps I have been going about this the wrong way, so I will try to be helpful and explain WHY your last edit was vandalism.

First off, the description intro, the quality of the intro had been greatly increased, Naming McTaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section, hence there is no need for it. The description gave a better just of what B-thoery of time is a whole. Undoing this completely is therefore vandalism, ESPECIALLY if you don'y first talk about it in the talk page before editing.

Secondly, you removed 'description', you then deleted the description as in metaphysics, changed the better, updated version of the physics part, then moved it in the origin section. There really is nothing I can say about this, I have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?!....

Thirdly you removed this section: It is noted by Dean Zimmerman in 'Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold' that A-theory is 'almost certainly a minority view among philosophers', while B-theory has 'achieved broad acceptance'.http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/zimmerman/Presentism%20and%20Rel.for.Web.2.pdf
It seems you perhaps have a personal agenda, favouring A-theory therefore editing in favour of it, this is not allowed on wikipedia, and it is vital to keep a Neutral point of view. The above statement however, is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.

Finally, and on the most relevant side, you Craig information, it is an improvement that you have put the Craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section.
However a lot of it is not quoted, rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. Such as...

""""The B-Theory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory, namely, that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming, so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. The Buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world, since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality, but this is not the case with temporal becoming."""" You stated this outright. This is an OPINION of Craig's it should be demonstrated as such, I also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion. 
In fact you have stated all of Craig's OPINIONS as fact.

If you want to make edits, please first discuss them in the talk page, and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not, and how it should be worded.

"Is Wikipedia broken? 

Hi Piotrus,
After reading your morsels of wisdom, I have a couple of questions/comments/rants for you. I have seen several times editors leaving WP claiming WP is/was broken beyond repair or something. I think such a claim is fundamentally wrong.

The way I see it, Wikipedia is a complex dynamical system, with rather nontrivial internal interactions of a huge number of contributors and bureaucrats.  Moreover, it is probably governed by certain laws under certain assumptions. There is a microscale (individual contributors editing certain articles), a mesoscale (groups of editors pushing their agenda in a group of articles) and a macroscale, the whole project evolving over years. On a microscale nothing matters. You, me can join, can leave Wikipedia, very few would even notice. In a matter of days, may be months names and contributions would be forgotten, the project would however survive. 

What is interesting to me is that your morsels capture certain dynamics on a mesoscale quite well. And that made me wonder if you can share your thoughts over the future dynamics of the whole project here. Not just some subproject, not just over the next few days, but the whole Wikipedia over years.

That brings me to the next question. How can one claim the system of Wikipedia is broken? Do they understand the dynamics of Wikipedia better than me so that they see something that defies/breaks some natural laws? I understand that they joined the project to help it achieve a certain goal (whatever they set in their mind) and after a failure to do so, they leave frustrated. But to claim Wikipedia is broken? Why? What do they see that I do not? To me it is akin to claiming that the nature is broken after seeing that foxes eat rabbits. What do you think about that? (  )",0

Ryan had cocked the rifle with the safety catch on, which  caused the rifle to jam. A ballistic expert testified this fact at trial and there was no contest. 
The rifle was intentionally kept by Ryan to prove his innocence - to prove the rifle had not fired a shot.

p.xxii =Though Peter’s name has now become powerful, he may not be as historical as we think he is, and the role we attribute to him may possibily be an amalgam of that of several individuals by the same name, one a martyred ‘cousin’ of both Jesus and James and their reputed successor in Palestine, Simeon bar Cleophas.’

p.143‘It is possible that the Cephas being referred to in between the references to ‘Peter’ in Paul’s letters is another ‘Simon’ or ‘Simeon’ – the Simeon bar Cleophas mentioned above as Jesus’ first cousin. Just as Simon Peter in Scripture is represented as being the successor to Jesus, this Simon or Simeon is represented by early Church tradition as being the successor to James. He is also of the family of Jesus, Cleophas being specifically denoted as the uncle of Jesus.’

BUT

p.143 ‘As we proceed, it will probably transpire that this Cleophas is not the uncle of Jesus, but rather his father, and there are traditions that to some degree represent him as such. In John 19:25, for instance, he is represented as the husband of Mary and this is probably true’ etc.

p.318 ‘the picture in early Church sources of the words of James’ successor Simeon bar Cleophas, the ‘Rechabite Priest’, who rebukes those stoning James the Just.'

p.324 ‘the election of Simeon by universal consent as ‘Bishop’ of the Church’ .- the restriction to ‘Jerusalem’ this time dropped.’

p.394 ‘Eusebius . .when discussing the election of Simeon bar Cleophas to succeed James as ‘Bishop of the Jerusalem Community’ or ‘Second Bishop’ of the early Church. Since Jerusalem was by this time in ruins, it is difficult to see Simeon simply as second Bishop of Jerusalem. (Whether Simeon is the cousin germane of Jesus, as Eusebius puts it, or the second or third brother of Jesus – also ‘Simon’ or ‘Simeon’ – will be discussed later.)

p.416 ‘Eusebius retains Hegesippus’ internal references, even though at this point he does not enumerate what these sects were. He does in a later passage where his note about the election of Simeon bar Cleophas to succeed James for some reason triggers a discussion of Hegesippus’ life.’

pp.468-9 (a) ‘Suppose we were to say, as also concluded above, that by ‘Rechabite’ Eusebius was trying to same something similar to ‘Essene’, ‘Nazirite’, or ‘Ebionite’; then out of this band of Essene or Ebionite ‘Priests’, one, James’  ‘cousin’ and successor, Simeon bar Cleophas, emerged as the next ‘Bishop of the Jerusalem Community’ in Palestine (only, after the fall of the Temple and Jerusalem, there clearly was no ‘Jerusalem Community’ any longer to speak of).’

(b) ‘If we now superimpose the story of the stoning of Stephen from Acts upon the story of the stoning of James from Epiphanious and Eusebius, then Simeon Bar Cleophas or the Rechabite Priestly ‘witness’ becomes James’ (and presumably Simeon’s) ideological adversary Paul . .

Got ur message/question.  I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....

It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.  

In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.

"Vascular Parkinsonism

Vascular parkinsonism is produced by one or more small strokes that affect the basal ganglia. A stroke is the loss of activity of a discreet brain area (lesion) because of blockage of the blood supply to that brain region. Vascular diseases are associated with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's Disease [1]. There are three different pathologic states that produce Vascular Parkinsonism (VP), including multiple lacunar infarctions in the basal ganglia area [2,3], subcortical arteriosclerotic changes (Binswanger's disease) [2,3] and a single vascular lesion that present a clinical picture indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease [2,3,4]. Parkinson's Disease symptoms occur in Vascular Parkinsonism [5-12]. However, resting tremor is either reduced [5,6], or absent [7,8]. Only a minority, but a large minority, of people with Vascular Parkinsonism respond to L-dopa [9,10].

"A reference of Jesus' cloak 

Quote from the insight book:

The color of the cloak with which Jesus Christ was clothed on the day of his execution has caused some persons to argue that a discrepancy exists in the Bible record with reference to this garment. Matthew said that the soldiers “draped him with a scarlet cloak” (Mt 27:28), while Mark and John say that it was purple. (Mr 15:17; Joh 19:2) However, instead of being a discrepancy, such a variation in describing the garment’s color merely gives evidence of the individuality of the Gospel writers and the fact that they were not in collusion. Matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him, that is, according to his evaluation of color, and he emphasized the garment’s red hue. John and Mark subdued the red tint, calling it purple. “Purple” can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red. So, Mark and John agree with Matthew that the garment was red to some extent. Of course, background and light reflection could have given it different casts. A body of water varies in color at different times, depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time. So, when such factors are considered, it is seen that the Gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak that mocking Roman soldiers clothed Christ with on the last day of his human life.",0

Regarding """"wars argument"""" - thanks, I will do that soon.
Here is my thinking, Krugman's criticism is mentioned 8 times in a article. It is intellectual dishonesty (and one  of character) to loudly criticize one school of thought and than refuse to even debate for an hour with an actual austrian economist; where he has debated with politicians """"to boost his book sales"""" in his own words. So if his critic is in any way or form relevant, why not settle it once for all and end with austrians, or if he doesn't want to lose his time on irrelevant things, he has humanitarian incentive (or why call out austrians in a first place?)...  So all in all, it comes to this, either criticizer and critic is irrelevant and should be deleted, or what is in my opinion far better solution, this discrepancy should be there for readers to know and decide for themselves. This could be done in one or two sentences, just a note that he refuses the offer of debate from 2010 although 105 000$ fund for Food bank New York was established; + a link to site.

 Understanding how Wikipedia does things 

Hello Mike, I see you have some concerns about the article. First off, I want to note that this is exactly why we always tell people don't try to write your own article on Wikipedia. I was willing to write one for you because I think you're an interesting subject, but you really need to stop trying to work on your own article. It is absolutely impossible for you to be objective about your own work, and also you keep trying to make edits which are not properly sourced. To answer a few points:

Why are the links to the National Traditional Country Music Association pages and the Library of Congress Recorded Sound Reference Center underlined in red as non-existent? These sites do exist.  They are non-existed on Wikipedia; we aren't saying they're non-existent in general, just that nobody has written an article about them here yet. The red means """"someone should write an article about them"""". Before they were blue because you were re-routing the link to go to their own homepage, but we don't allow such external links to be used in the middle of the page like that, and also because that obscures the fact that we need somebody to write those articles.
 Regarding your nickname: if you say Plantenga is wrong, I've removed the nickname. However, you cannot simply go and fill in whatever nickname you want in its place, unless you have a clearly cited source.
 You really need to read our guideline/warning WP:Autobiography to understand exactly why you shouldn't be messing with your biography. You should not be making any edits on that page except to remove blatant vandalism. Again, you are literally the last person on earth who should be editing your own biography on Wikipedia, because doing so compromises the neutrality of the project.
 Lastly, I really suggest you read WP:Verifiability, not truth. The long/short is that a given fact is only useful if it can be cited to a good source, and no matter how true a fact is, it's no good on an encyclopedia without citation. So while we of course recognize that in the larger world, accuracy is the goal, on an encyclopedia our concern is how documentable a fact is. So on a certain level, we literally don't care whether a fact in Plantenga's book or in a Washington Post article is completely accurate, we care that it's clearly documented. Whereas if you make """"corrections"""" based on your personal knowledge, that just makes the article weaker because each such edit decreases its Verifiability.

At this point, you really need to just accept that you have a biography on Wikipedia, and it's sourced to published works, and be (moderately) happy with that. Wikipedia is absolutely not here for you to """"get the rest of the story out"""", or """"build your brand"""" or whatnot, we're just here to compile and organize information that has already been published by neutral experts. So please refrain from trying to edit your own article, it always ends badly and wastes time for everyone involved to have to change things back and forth, and just trust the Wikipedia community to do our best to keep things running smoothly.

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

Yes, I thank you for your time in the matter and I know you were trying to help. I can see that what I was doing was violating WP:POINT. 

Originally the argument was because of the table width which I knew from the beginning was a dumb thing to fight over, but I was only thinking of aesthetics. She trounced me for it saying that I don't know what I'm doing, that she was enforcing MoS standards and it was a known problem because the page didn't show up correctly on certain monitor sizes. All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.

I've had to play this stupid game before with other idiots around here, usually they just go away, but she wanted to continue talking shit.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.

@Stefano: I have forgiven you so why do you continue to be so hostile towards me? Really, I cannot comprehend the level of animosity as shown by you towards me when this PROD is clearly a community based consensus. In real life, people like Bill Gunston would always check and recheck their information prior to the publication of his article and/or book, he has help from other editor giving peer review. So why can't you accept this logically like a man instead of trying to bulldoze your way through the plain view of so many of us here? FWIW, I think I speak for everyone here when I say that we don't need your input if you carry on with your pointy behaviour. One, you are not Bill Gunston; two, your level of proficiency in English language leaves a lot to be desired; three, your reference source is very questionable (per WP:Verifiability#Self-published sources); four, you dislike getting help from other editors when they are obviously trying to help, preferring to bulldoze instead; and lastly, MB1 made it very clear that you have trouble understanding Wikipedia's editing guidelines and policies even though you meant well, you have somehow managed to offend everyone here for god-knows-what reason.

 Intro needs urgent fixing 

The last two sentences in the intro need rewording/or a strong citation:

""""The situation surrounding his assasination continues to be murky, while he reportedly was assasinated by Nation of Islam officials, he also had many enemies in the United States government. It is widely believed that the government also had a role in the assasination.""""

I am no expert on the man but I have checked several reliable sources (E.g. """"Malcolm X""""  Encyclopedia Britannica.  1990 Ed.) and they don't say anything about a government role. I am not saying that the viewpoint is untenable, but I don't think 'widely believed' is correct.

If someone more knowledgeable on the subject doesn't do it in the next day or so then I will (I am hesitant to leap in as I imagine that this article can be controversial).

Also, it's spelt Assassination (unless us Aussies are out of step with the rest of the world on that one – happens occasionally.)

Hank Williams didn't listen to too many of their records. He was a country boy and was influenced by swing music, yet he recorded pure rockers. Country music played as much a vital roll in the formation of rock n roll than black music, no matter how some people wish to deny it. Bill Haley, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and many more of the greatest rockers had their roots in country. Chuck Berry was also influenced by it and , if he had been white, would have probably been seen as Country, rather than R&B.; Elvis is allowed to be called """"The King"""", just as much as, say James Brown is allowed to be called """"The hardest working man in showbiz"""", you don't see people who dislike him throwing everything but the kitchen sink in to try and make out it was a """"marketing"""" ploy and their favorite artists worked harder.  02:29""",0

 The Truth About Me, Stephen 

Hello, you sexy little love-hole!
I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.

"""I have found further evidence related to this big hoax.  

The same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual's fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author's wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! 

I do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don't know what course to take, and really don't have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax.  

There is no record anywhere else online of a Vitus Sebastian Barbaro that I can find.  There is no record anywhere else online of The Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent either.  There is no record of a """"Pugilist Club"""" aka """"Fight Club"""" at Purdue anywhere else online.

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil). The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way, so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately, i propose one of the following pictures be shown in it's place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour:

GITHUB is the top place where new computer projects are created and discussed by computer programmers. Anything that isn't right gets corrected pretty fast. For over two years the PyPrimes speed test which is open source has had not one person question the results and since it is open source anyone can download the core of Python a major new computer language and run PyPrimes and test all the various prime algorithms. Every algorithm lost to the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, every one but Prime Spirals.

Now, outside of that real world test, the average mathematician or computer programmer is pretty much clueless as to primes and how they really interact in the modern world today (ie. Cryptology).

Now I could have used a ton of links to NPOV and alternative sites where for 20 years you have various groups arguing what this new algorithm means for the world. In fact much of the original argument was erased from Usenet in the 1990's, and the only group that could have done that was the NSA. 

Since the original algorithm was released when the NSA still controlled encryption related publishing (original paper was 1995) NO PUBLISHING COMPANY would have touched anything claiming to be how this algorithm made all encryption OBSOLETE, that was the original paper, saying to the world in 1995, here world, here is where every prime number above 5 MUST BE, there are only 8 Prime Spirals, now your whole concept of encryption has been DESTROYED by this work.

So, this prime algorthm was tied to national security issues in 1995, and in 1995 the NSA had a headlock on all academic publishing and guess what they still do today, who funds the AMS and the top journals? THE NSA

Now my original article didn't go this deep into why in 1995, this work could not be published in academia due to the NSA chokehold on academic publishing for anything that could possibly be used to create new encryption or damage old encryption.

Now 99.99% of the world is clueless that PRIMES are a big deal in crypto.

A HUGE DEAL

So understanding where they all exist and on what spirals they exist, you can now do neat tricks, like create huge seed keys for ECC crypto that gives the person that creates such a seed key a backdoor to that crypto, oh no, now we're talking about the heart of the issue WIKI LEAKS is all about crypto and how the NSA has a special skeleton key to the seed keys released by NSA projects like NIST and ENISA (europes equivalent).

Now in 1995 to 1999 or so this was discussed in many thousands of pages all over usenet, try to find them now, most are gone, now I actually participated in that era in some usenet discussions about the ENNISA paper, you cannot find one thread now mentioning ENNISA from the 1990's.

So erased all the discussion in math and physics groups about ENNISA?

Yet, if you really know where to look, you can find some references to the work, not ENNISA but the person's name and some of the the actual math still exists.

Now, the math is in books, who published the books, the guy that released it has his own publishing company and it was done via ebooks.

So I have a copy of the ebook. I know it's real.

Now today you have academics taking credit for bits and pieces of his work, and they are 100% controlled sock puppets of the NSA.

So the NSA is now controlling what the public learns about this discovery 20 years after the fact it was released via usenet.

One of the new algorithms is the Atkin sieve, look who published it with Atkin, the guy that sued the US Government in the 1990's to allow software to be published without interference of the NSA.

Look at the guys wiki page, he was tutored by the guy that actually created ECC, the stuff the NSA is using to backdoor all encryption today.

So 1995, the guy is suing the US Gov and 10 years later he is at AMS as the co-author of one of the 3 prime algorithms discussed in ENNISA in 1995.

Just google NSA and AMS, see all the NSA funding.

Just like when academics rebelled in the 1980's against the stranglehold the NSA had on crypto, guess what the NSA did, they bought out all of academia with grants.

Now I'm not a tin foil hat guy/girl, I'm retired, I was in academia and I can actually discuss stuff about math and how academia works and how various topics were taboo in the 1970's through the 1990's.

So AMS MAA AMA, etc, all are now in bed with grants and funding from the NSA.

You look at sieve of Atkin and who is on the paper the kid that sued the government over crypto software in the 1990's, who was groomed by the daddy of ECC now the top crypto used",0

Italics
Hi there! I've been coming across your recent contributions on plant species. Good work so far! I see one of the references you're using is from Timber Press - I've adored that publisher for quite some time (and they have quite a bit of my money). Anyway, I was wondering if you could pay close attention to italicization of species and genera when you write your articles; it would be a big help. Thanks! Cheers,   
Oops, sorry, one more thing. Also kindly watch the overlinking. I've counted at least three links to genus in the same paragraph. The first mention of the term is all that requires linking. Cheers,   

 Thank you!

While I agree that this article isn't FA material, I must suggest that your added criticism in the lead is also repetitive.  The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, """"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan."""")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.

There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.

 There is a way to indirectly reflect your source(your Dutch book) to """"Martha Gellhorn"""". First, you need go to the section concerning her attitude to Stalin or Stalin's communism in the article """":nl:Martha Gellhorn"""" and make the sentence sourced as mentioned above, showing the Dutch title(""""Travels with myself and another""""?), the chapter name 'Een blik op Moedertje Rusland', the pages(p. xy or pp. xy - xz) of your source, and so on. ISBN is preferable. Quote is possible and helpful for readers. Basically, English templates are available in any Wikipedia. 
 After editing nl:Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"Hulmpmiddelen"""",) and click """"Permanente Kooppeling"""". You can get the """"oldid=XXXXXXXX"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Second, you need come to the section concerning her attitude to Stalin or Stalin's communism in the article """"Martha Gellhorn"""" and edit. 
 And before you click """"Save page"""", enter """"From [[:nl:Martha Gellhorn]] as of revision (date,month,year,time,)..."""" into """"Edit summary"""".
 After editing Martha Gellhorn, see the left side bar, (click """"toolbox"""", and click """"Permanent link"""". You can get the """"oldid=YYYYYYYYYY"""" of the page from the address bar. 
 Third, you need announce in the article talk page(Talk:Martha Gellhorn) that you translated from the Dutch Wikipedia. You have to make a new section and place this Template:translated page, that is, {{translated page| nl | Martha Gellhorn | version = XXXXXXXX | insertversion = YYYYYYYYYY | section = ?Political and religious views }}.

New sub-catagory

I wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:

→ Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.

→ Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan. 

→ The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, """"I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais."""" (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.

We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture.""",0
"""

According to Simon Schama's book The Power of Art, Guernica was painted in response to an article that Picaso saw in an French newspaper. The first line suggests that he was already working on the project when the bombs fell. He had agreed to do 'a politically minded painting' for a 1937 Paris Fair, but he had not decided what he was going to do until after the events in Geurnica unfolded. It was a front page photograph of the inferno that inspired the work.

 

""""Quite possibly apocryphal""""
I cut this from the article.

A story, quite possibly apocryphal, circulates about Guernica. During World War II, a German officer sees a copy of the painting for the first time, in the presence of Picasso.  In a wondering tone he asks Picasso """"Did you do this?"""" and Picasso replies: """"No, you did.""""

If it is """"quite possibly apocryphal"""" and we have no attribution or citation, it does not belong in the article.   | Talk 02:33, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Except that this is extremely widely believed and noted.  I recall hearing the equivalent when I was at the Prado. -  02:40, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Then someone should be able to find a citation at least of the anecdote being told. (& was Guernica ever in the Prado? In the early 80s it was in an annex to the Prado and then was moved to the Reina Sofia, no?)   | Talk 07:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Duh, yeah that is what I meant to say. It has been 4 years since I was there.  Yes, I would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote. -  13:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:
Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, """"Did you do that?,"""" Picasso coldly had replied, """"No, you did."""" 
Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)
 We can certainly cite the fact that Picasso himself told a (possibly apocryphal) story. It makes the line his, even if it's not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances.   | Talk 16:05, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)
 Yes, if Picasso really told it. So far, no sources are backing up that website (or even just repeating that version), so I'm not too keen on it. Otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before.  · Talk 16:46, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)

 Nudity? 

I reverted this from Category:Paintings containing nudity to Category:Paintings. Clearly, the fact that one naked female human breast is visible in the painting is a very minor fact about the painting; no one by a very weird obsessive would look for it there. It is primarily a political work about war. I could make a case that it is a perfect illustration that nakedness is not always nudity, but I think it suffices to say",0

Even the conversation about it may be deleted forever. This comment, like everything else on this page, does not cite sources. This comment may also be in violation of some rule.

That's an interesting point. Several people are starting to look into issues with the deletion system already. Will you be helping out with that?   

> Hi Kim.  I don't know what """"looking into"""" even means, in regards to Wikipedia. I don't know who people are, who does what, or who created the rules.  I don't know what """"helping out"""" means, in regards to your question.

My first effort here, at creating an entry, was put up for deletion in 4 minutes, then deleted without discussion by some admin.  Now I can't find the brief discussion about that. 

But it led to the realization that many many pages here, the ones that state policy and rules for wikipedia, don't cite sources.  The pages don't list authors either.  They are nebulous pages, that don't follow the rules those pages insist I follow.

Interesting?  Damn right it is interesting.  I've read a lot of criticism of wiki, and defended wikipedia for years.  But now, well, I see a huge flaw in the system.

Right after I hit create, I realized there was already an entry, but it was under ALS Association, so I hit edit this page, to make it a redirect. It came up as deleted!  In a matter of seconds, some asswipe called Nakon had deleted the page.

(Deletion log); 03:28 . . [Nakon]  deleted """"The ALS Association"""" (CSD A7 (Corp): Article about a company that doesn't assert significance)

Considering there already was a page, and it certainly is significant, the ultrafast deletion is an example of some kind of fucked up mentality.  This idiot has to be using some kind of software to scan every new article, and s/he must have spent 2 seconds before hitting some sort of deletion key.

Unbelievable.  This level of bullshit goes beyond anything I have ever encountered on the Internet before.  If I had changed the entry to a redirect, I would have missed the event.

I use Wikipedia all the time, but I spend almost no time editing or creating pages.  Most of the changes I have made over the years have been fixing minor mistakes or reverting vandalism.  Having managed to avoid ever being drawn into the",0

This section is disorganized and somewhat confusing.

I will average ranged values (i.e. 21-33% becomes 27%) and omit sources that have no value until they can be provided at a later date (these are grain-fed cows milk, spirulina, okra and castor oil).

From Fraser:

This article possesses a number of quite significant errors:

First, concerning the so-called characteristics of the deep house sound, many deep house tracks have a 'thumpy' bass drum sound, thus making them practicable for a dancefloor; although there is a wide use of effects employed in the production of deep house music, the use of filters etc., is no more prevalent than in other sub-genres of house, for instance disco house (where filters are used ad nauseum) and dub house (where reverb and echo are pronounced). 

In contrast to the traits mentioned in the article that characterise the deep house sound, I would argue that the most defining characteristic of the music is its mood, being typically abstract and atmospheric, more concerned with taking the listener on a mental expedition that making a dancefloor move.

Lastly, the statement that """"deep house music is often synonymous with 'Lounge Music'"""" is quite simply untrue and should not be kept in this article. Deep house music, although often possessing loungey characteristics, for example, vibraphones, smooth rhodes keys etc., never has and never will be seen as equivalent to lounge music. I am really quite shocked that such misinformation was put on the site; the person who wrote the article, whilst possessing some knowledge of the music, is well wide of the mark in a number of his or her comments.

I am basing all my judgments on being a DJ and avid deep house record collector for 10 years.""",0

 Confused about how members are selected 

I'm a bit confused how the members are selected. I know each has to be approved individually, but how exactly are they nominated (self nominated?)? Are only the appropriate number for each region nominated or is it possible to have more then the total allowed for a region nominated? If it's possible to have more then the total, and more then the total are approved, how exactly are the states which will actually be on the council selected (e.g. based on the votes received). Finally, whatever the case, what happens if not enough states are selected/approved from a region?  

I hink that they are self-nominated because there were more candidates then mandates to disperse.  

To address your questions in order:
They are all self-nominated. The countries have to volunteer, and they have to invite observers into their countries to check how their own human rights record actually is.
It is possible, and intended, that more than the alotted number of slots nominate themselves; else, why vote if we have exactly as many candidates as slots?
As has happened for the Western European and Others Group, the ones with the most votes in support are selected. (None of the candidates from the WEaOG got less than 50% approval, but Greece and Portugal got the smalles number of votes, I believe.)

When a numbered IP starts screwing with your article, you revert him. End of story. Everyone will back you up on that. Esecially since you're never supposed to delete sourcing from an article. Because people who do that put the article author in the situation you're in now.
I'm just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WP's guidelines. However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they """"salt the earth"""" so the article can never again be created.

Ultimately, to reach your goal, it doesn't matter what's right and wrong here. What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others. If you've been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that. Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy. 
Go look at Order of Nine Angles. That's an article I rescued from AfD. The article used to, ages ago, be quite frankly stupid. It's about a supposed Satanic cult, of which there's only 1 confirmed member. But since it was mentioned in half a dozen scholarly books or more, I managed to get the article accepted - by following the rules. It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable. The problem is you're almost out of time - you can completely repair an article during AfD, and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote. But you'd have to start now.   """,0

I'm happy to help, but unfortunately I won't have time to deal with this in any detail for about 10 days.  I agree that Stevecyberbunny'''s edits are inappropriate, but I don't agree that they're vandalism: edits are only considered vandalism if an editor is attempting to harm the article.  In this instance, I think the editor believes he his correcting inaccuracies.  In my opinion, he is adding material not supported by reliable sources.  While this is inappropriate, it's technically different from vandalism.  For example, if no reliable, published source explicitly says Matt the Knife is, as he put it in an earlier edit, """"facing scrutiny,"""" or that his records have been challenged, then the article shouldn't say those things either.

First I have to ask you if you have any connection to the subject in the article, because that will limit the ways in which can mitigate the problem.  If you are affiliated with Matt the Knife in any way, it is generally considered inappropriate for you to be editing the article  with some important exceptions I'll come to in a moment.

If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.  
At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy.

Your usual obfuscation. There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don't really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined! If you can't put a number on it you can't claim it's """"real """".

Temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this, when energy of phase transitions is involved. For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else, and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer. They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That's a clue that they aren't fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there. It actually has nothing to do with """"heat"""" in a thermodynamic sense. 18:46, 14""",0

"To start: this cannot be discussed with you. You are topic banned from agricultural chemicals broadly construed. As per the article content, DOW are quite clearly a company who specialise in agricultural chemicals, and RE Bhopal - this was a chemical disaster that involved a chemical mainly used in fertiliser. You are not allowed to edit in this topic area.

However for anyone else: coatracking environmental concerns with one company into another companies article is non-neutral editing. Dow and Dupont are not merged yet. Info on past DuPont environmental concerns may be relevant on a combined Dow-Dupont article once the companies merge - I assume at that point someone will either create a new article on the new company, or attempt to merge the Dow-Dupont articles together. From experience and past convention it is likely this would end up as a third article with the Dow & Dupont articles covering the individual histories of the respective companies. Assuming this article is kept as a historical article of Dow prior to the merge, it wouldnt be valid here, would be at DuPont, and would be at an article after the merger.

RE Bhopal: The only reason Dow is even relevant is that activists are claiming Dow is responsible for the cleanup once it acquired Carbide many years later. Which is more than covered by the information included currently. Detailed info on the Bhopal disaster is available at the dedicated article and the article for Carbide (who were responsible for the problem).

Excessive info included above places undue weight on events that were entirely out of Dow's control and unrelated to them except very remotely. Its practically a textbook example of an attempt to skew an article to make a company look worse than it actually is.",0

Thanks for the 'typo fix' suggestion.  It certainly makes things simpler for me.  As for your other admonitions, concerning my responses to this person Hoary, I have been attempting to improve the article via a constructive colloquy with the editor Æµ§œš¹.  This Hoary person appears get his or her orgasmic jollies making asinine slurs and commentary that does not address the subject of Ebonics nor the inconsistencies in his or her logic.  I have verbally cleaned this person Hoary’s clock and yet this person Hoary keeps coming back for more.  Clearly this person Hoary loves the sadomasochistic verbal exchanges that he or she has invited and is having with me.  You would do better to make your admonitions to this Hoary person because I will not tolerate ‘dog whistle’ insults and racial slurs from Hoary, you or anyone else.  So you just block my edits all you want. Blocking my edits won’t make the inaccuracies and outright lies that Wikipedia is disseminating on the subject of Ebonics accurate or true.   If this person Hoary wants to discuss Black English or African American Vernacular English he or she should take his or her discussion to the Wikipedia Black English or African American Vernacular English section or page.  Ebonics is not Black English, African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the language of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans is a dialect of English and genetically akin to the Germanic language family to which English belongs.  If you do not understand this fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated? You should have called it the Black Anglo Saxon Diaspora Project instead.  But then, there would have to be historical linguistic evidence that Black Anglo Saxons brought Early Modern Black English, African American Vernacular English dialects to colonial America from somewhere in Germanic Europe.

 """"disputed"""", """"Judea and Samaria"""" and other such nonsense 

This revert violates multiple policies and guidelines. To begin with, there are an abundance of sources that clearly say that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights were occupied in 1967 and remain occupied to this day. The usage of """"disputed territory"""" is POV, it reflects the extreme minority view that these territories are not occupied and disregards the overwhelming majority of sources that say that it is. This is the chosen language of the right wing of the Israeli political spectrum, and it is not in compliance with NPOV to use it in the encyclopedia's narrative voice. Additionally, the repeated usage of the terms Judea and Samaria when referring to a territory violates WP:WESTBANK. This edit should be reverted. nableezy - """,0

The astronomy students never rewrote the lab assignments though and listened politely to my lecture so it would mean a complete change in the relationship for me to conduct this whatever it is as you are suggesting.  I never claimed authority over Plant Project  it is their claim over my articles.  My suggestion is that I was writing a not so bad article while a bunch of 10 year olds were demonstrating how they play kick the can or something like this.

Gyan Publishing and circular refs

Yikes. Those pseudo sources are back again. I knew I should have started WP:List of Circular References way back then. Just never got around to it (and I had some disagreement from other editors at that time). What do you think, Will? Would this be a good idea? — (talk) 
Another pseudo-source I see used often are some books called something like the """"Webster Book of quotations on Politics"""" (but that's not it), which are issued on a variety of topics. They cite their source as Wikipedia, but they abbreviate it """"WP"""" and many editors don't catch that.  I think there's merit in a central list. It wouldn't fluctuate much - books aren't going to be re-issued to address the problem, though some websites might fix it. The only gray area I see are those sources which cite Wikipedia, where it's possible to exclude the WP-sourced content and still use the other parts. I suppose that a search of the RSN archives and of pages that link to WP:CIRCULAR would find most instances that have been discussed. This problem is only going to get worse as Wikipedia continues to grow and as publishers grow more desperate for profit in a dwindling market.     talk   
I agree. The problem will only get worse and, over time, it becomes more difficult to parse the article histories to determine if/when the article was copied. And rather than search through the growing mountain of archives, it would be nice to be able to quickly direct an editor to a previous discussion  especially in cases like ISHA and Gyan which will obviously pop up again. I think what would work is a page with a table format which lists the title, the publisher, a link to the RSN archived discussion, and a Notes column which discuss those 'gray areas""""  whether the entire source is copied or particular chapters/sections.

Re: Friends episodes articles.
I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editor(s) capitalized all the first letters of the titles.  I totally agree with your point though. I will take some time to format these correctly as well.
As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth.  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format.  As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job.

Thanks! Your copyedits are much appreciated, as is the advice. To reply to your points:
I was afraid that the section about his books rambled a bit, although I want to make sure to keep enough of it in. Especially in Szigeti on the Violin, he reveals a lot about his personal philosophy of music and violin playing, which (in my opinion)is very important for his biography. That said, I will try trimming it down.
Yes, he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years, and as far as I can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. There are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography, maybe I'll try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere. 
I had a good laugh at your remark about how I should get academic credit for this, especially because just a few days ago, my obnoxious Music History professor bellowed """"Don't ever look up anything on Wikipedia if you expect to stay in this class!

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...

 Here is a little something that I came up with myself

Let the boxes equal the letters A-V
Let the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn't matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])
Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).
This occurs is (1/22) cases.
(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)

If you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:

(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). 

This can be re-written as:

(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).

There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524
This occurs is 21/22 cases so:

(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)

Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46",0

 RfC: (Policy) Using bad practices from one article to justify another and possible sock puppetry; and (Politics) Acceptability of aggregated data in """"Election Results"""" section 

Policy
While not getting into the issue of reverting edits without first reaching out to the original editor to understand their motivation (in this case, the deletion of a table),  justifies the reversion of my deletion by pointing to other articles with the same flawed table...which he created!

Examples:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Papineau_%28electoral_district%29&diff;=prev&oldid;=654041277 - the above article
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottawa_South&diff;=prev&oldid;=593333525 - Ottawa South
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edmonton_Strathcona&diff;=636097681&oldid;=622403799 - Edmonton Strathcona

While we're on this topic, I found an identical table with identical formatting and citation in Toronto Centre...but added by !

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_Centre&oldid;=670004225

This strikes me as possible sock puppetry.  I'm hoping a more sophisticated WP editor can either confirm or deny my hypothesis.

Earl Andrew already admitted to working as a polling firm employee in Ottawa. It seems likely the same user is responsible not only for adding the content cited, but actually generating it in meatspace.  This in itself wouldn't make the content non-NPOV, though one has to wonder why Earl Andrew guards Canadian electoral district pages so jealously (including the """"Political Geography"""" sections which he invented, the topic of our last edit war).  Articles about Canadian electoral districts are not Earl Andrew's soapbox and should not be treated as such.

Further, in the edit history of every single article mentioned above (only a handful, but statistically, that makes the following more damning), Earl Andrew and Fungus Guy are responsible for the lion's share of edits. While I understand that topics as specialized as Canadian politics may have only a handful of active editors, this appears to be a suspicious pattern and should be treated with all due seriousness.

Politics
's """"Redistributed results"""" tables and the identical table added by , are composed of data aggregated from Elections Canada results.  I take no issue with the data, but being aggregated, they are no longer results.  As such, they should at least be moved into a more relevant section with an explanation, if not removed altogether.  Putting the table in the """"Election results"""" section implies they are Elections Canada tallies, quite possibly having the effect of misinforming voters.  And we're right in the middle of an election campaign!

Unsorted
I could have done a lot more editing in the past 4+ years, but instead shied away from larger and more time-consuming edits and rewrites because I felt the end result might be another """"100,000 Edit Man"""" coming out of the woodwork to stifle me.  When more voluminous editors are allowed to browbeat others into submission because they generate a lot of """"content"""" or have a page full of barnstars, it necessarily degrades the quality of WP by reducing the number of editors.  It's hard enough to fight the paid corporate trolls on here, dammit!

"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi",0

Hello,

recently you requested  for Wikipedia:WikiProject Christianity, Wikipedia:WikiProject Saints, Wikipedia:WikiProject Religion, and Wikipedia:WikiProject Cryptozoology. I'm not sure whether you already announced these listings to the other project members (I found nothing to that end on the project talk pages).

"Chokhor Rinpoche 
 A brief biography of fourth Chokhor Tenzin Chogyal 

Chokhor Rinpoche was born to father Kalsang Dorjee and mother Kalsang Chokey on 20th Oct, 1979 (the day was on auspicious day of Dipawali) in Kalimpong, the hill station of West Bengal, North East state of India. 

While Ripoche’s mother was pregnant, there were so many auspicious signs showed to her. She often dreamt of a white rabbit sleeping on her lap; thousand of twinkling stars entering to her womb and became different jewels. She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.

After a year, the little Lhundub used to do pray in front of the photo of His Holiness with the decoration different fruits as offering. He also used to sit on piled pillows and saying he is Lama and take his blessing, to his relative children. Moreover, the little boy was happy to visit monastery and meet monks.

When the little boy was on four years old, he often told his dream to his parent that he dreamt of a lord of charnel grounds [having the form of a skeleton] telling him that your home is not a place of long term living, you need to go far distance where there is huge temple, and you should go with two person who would come to invite you. Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.

In the beginning of year 1983, the little boy started to go English School in Kalimpong. In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.

While little boy, Lhundub Tsondue was on his routine to Nursery school, on 21st March, 1985, he was recognized as the unmistaken reincarnation of 3rd Chokhor Rinpoche by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.

Few days after his admission to the monastery, Geshe Jampa Topgyal taught few alphabets to read as dependent-arising. Then Geshe Gyaltsen took Rinpoche to consult Geshe Ngawang Choesang of Tsangpa Khangtsen as a teacher. On Geshe Ngawang la’s guidance of long fifteen years, Rinpoche learned from the beginning of reading and writing, Tibetan Calligraphy, Sumchupa and Tagjug, Tibetan literature. During the consultation of Geshe Ngawang la, Rinpoche memorized all daily prayers and the root text of (Abhisamaya Alamkara, Madhyamikavatara, Abhi Dharma Khosh).Recited hundred thousand of “Tendrel Toepa”,(Praise of Dependent Arising, by Tsongkhapa). While consulting Geshe Ngawang Choesang, Rinpoche also went to Sera Je Secondary School for five years. 

In 1988, during the Lamrim teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Chokhor Rinpoche got the first privately audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Drepung monastery. His Holiness gave him name “Tenzin Chogyal“.

In 1992, Chokhor Rinpoche left the academic studies and joined the monastic education with consultation of Gyume Khensur Lobsang Delek as teacher. In 1994, Rinpoche took novice vow from His Eminence Choden Rinpoche and added name “Palsangpo” after “Tenzin Chogyal” as novice name.

As the rule and regulation of the monastery, in 1996, 25th day of 6th month Rinpoche was stood on the Rigchung ceremony in the congregation of Sera Jey monks, everyone was surprised with his under/over tone of explanation with melancholic tune and answering of debate opponent.

While studying the fundamental philosophy in the monastery, on the two month vacation, Chokhor Rinpoche used to accomplish the recitation of Mig-tsema and some vocation took complete retreat on Yamantaka and had its burnt sacrifices. In 1999 Rinpoche was invited to Italy by his sponsor during the vacation, Rinpoche taught and gave lecture on Tibetan issue to Italian",0

"Mirv, I don't think anyone here has made that claim.  On the other hand, they do insist that POV edits not be made, or at least brought to the Talk: page first for discussion.  And you seem to ignore Wikipedia:Be bold, which states 
But please note: be bold in updating pages does not mean that you should make deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories, such as Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Abortion. In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily.

If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is.

If you are an experienced wiki-ist, you will probably have a good sense what will be accepted edits, and which edits should be discussed first.

If you are new to wikipedia, or unsure how others will view your proposals, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either:

   1. If the material in question is a sentence or so in length, copy it to the Talk page and list your objections there.
   2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is.

Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.

Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.

I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic, then we can go with that. The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church. Williamson, in his association with the SSPX, was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic, even while not in full communion. Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a """"Catholic rite"""". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession. My suggestion for a succinct description of Cox would be """"Independent Catholic bishop"""", as that is how his church is described.   """,0

WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?  

Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.  

I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.

Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.

 Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 

Hey there! I created an article for Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and I was wondering if you could help me out by verifying the translations of the rules I made from a document posted on LTV's website . I noticed on your user page that you have written that you are fluent in Latvian so if you have the time I would appreciate your help! My main concern is that I believe they wrote that they will select ten artists and songs to compete in this national final, but during their description of the shows, I'm not sure I understood how they will select only four entries for the final during the preceding shows.   
I haven't spoken/read/written Latvian (I mostly spoke Czech at home even when I lived in Latvia) in a pretty long time so I'm a bit rusty, so don't hold it against me if I misinterpreted, but here's what I got out of the rules. The first semi-final is non-elimination and just supposed to introduce the songs to the audience. In the second and third semi-finals, two songs are eliminated in each show,",0
"Yes, I am Russell Noftsker.  I had noticed over the years that the errors and loss of detail were compounding concerning the reported events surrounding Symbolics, Inc.  As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.

The particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.

These paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.

Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.

Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.

This incident played a key roll in causing Stallman to spin out of the AI & Lisp field and to tackle creating a public domain copy of Unix.  Gifted as he is, my colleagues and I feel it is useful for people to know what motivated Stallman’s change in course of action and to get a sense of how opposed he was and may still be to conventional business and business law.

Although I have not laid hands on the documentation for this event within the last two decades, I believe that my copies are still in my possession and the Dave Andre, John Kulp and Patrick Winston can verify the details cited above.

"""This comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test.  The author writes """"But we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create."""" Of course I and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only """"some few things!""""  The problem is that Mike Serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants.  We do not want """" society where most people are only allowed to know some few things.""""  We want a very narrow and specific limitation - no cheat sheets (questions and answers) to tests that are used to help people. Other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better! Is that clear enough? We do not advocate that """"only psychologists know psychology"""" as falsely claimed, only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked.  It's as simple and limited as that. Leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the SAT or some other test would make articles on those subjects """"encyclopedic."""" A """"democratic sense of equality"""" brought about by leaking  psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams (""""why shouldn't everybody be able to practice medicine? let's leak all the questions ans answers...""""), etc.  

When you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose: to examine how well students have learned history.  A history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him (on the contrary!).  He just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and it's much harder for this to be done if he can't use a test to do it.  Similarly, when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam, you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. This makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified.  The purpose of the Rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. Mr. Serfas' statement that """"is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful"""" is absolutely false.  There is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by James Wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even Wood, the Rorschach's main opponent, states that the test is not worthless (see this article. This controversy can be adequately described (and ought to be) in the article without including the tests' """"cheat sheet"""" (its questions and answers). Even Wood states that the Rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. Thus, by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder; a tool for doing so has ben compromised.  People might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given, or conversely not be treated for something they have.  Most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the Rorschach in the article.  It would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests, etc.  They object to including information about the test.  Just not the test's questions and answers.      

So no, psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs, or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed, which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. They're just people defending a test used to help people which, like most tests, gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. It's rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree, and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position.  I hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.

Some people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the """"dark ages"""" by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. I invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side?  There was a time when """"common sense"""" indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. The science, backed up by thousands of studies, is clear that the Rorschach works - but """"common sense"""" tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. Or that some kind of """"magic"""" is involved (scientists were once accused of witchcraft).",0
"""

""""WP:COMMONNAME is in fact not applicable here"""" because why exactly? That policy on using the common name rather than the """"official"""" name applies to all kinds of article titles, not just to names of people who are politicians or entertainers. It applies to names of foods, animal species, laws of physics, obscure cities in ancient Greece, etc.   """,0

Definition of Islamophobia
 Literal Definition of Phobia
pho·bi·a (fō'bē-ə): A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangeroushttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phobia.

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

"Cabalist team of sysops/users undermines WP’s reliability  promoting Greek nationalistic POV

They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion.

Is your opinion that this is an """"uninteresting semantic point"""" as an expert in semantics or as an expert in Catholic theology?

A Catholic is free to drive an SUV, support a war, or support the death penalty because there is no binding teaching forbidding any of them, even though one or more Popes have taken personal positions opposing them.

This isn't enough for Stacker, who removes the correct caption due to his desire to make people think they are seeing the real thing.  I don't suppose this is much different from standard Wikipedia lies about the Soviet Union, Venezuela, Iraq or so forth, but I'll correct it anyway.  I know most of Wikipedia is a bunch of half-baked lies and propaganda of this type, but once in a while people will read this and realize this is just another lie and distortion on Wikipedia in the service of a certain cause.  I find it humorous how while the reality of Solzhenitsyn's anti-semitism is removed from this article, the non-reality of this picture increases in Wikiality.",0

Somewhat earlier  correctly observed that """"a citation for that formal definition of equality with domain but not codomain could be useful in that discussion"""".  The citation I gave is from Tom Apostol Calculus, page 54, but this is rather old.  Looking in recent literature was very instructive.  The problem is that definitions of function equality in the literature seem rare somehow (not found in about a dozen of recent math and CS books where such a definition could be expected).  Googling on """"function equality"""" or """"equal functions"""" was equally ineffective, but """"functions f and g are equal"""" yields many results (mostly lecture notes).  Some definitions of function equality include codomain equality, some do not. Here are a few that do not include codomain equality, as requested:

http://solitaryroad.com/c303.html
 http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/handouts/25%20Functions.pdf
 http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sgerking/ECO%203401/Chapter%202.ppt
 http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m3000/lecture8a.pdf
 http://www.cse.unl.edu/~cse235/files/Functions.ppt

An interesting subtlety: many of the latter group define a codomain, but do not include it in the definition of function equality.  As Leibniz would say, this means that they do not really consider the codomain as part of the definition of a function.  More subtle: some talk about """"the domain of f"""" but about """"the codomain"""" (without """"of f"""").

A pragmatic observation: authors including a codomain (say Y) in the definition of a function seem to do very little with it, except (i) defining when a function is """"onto"""" instead of """"onto Y"""", (ii) allowing it to restrict flexibility in the way functions can be combined, for instance, by composition.

...the Nixon administration decided to try to ensure that international financial relations should be taken out of the control of state Central Banks and should be increasingly centred upon private financial operators. It sought to achieve this goal through exploiting US control over  international oil supplies. 

It is still widely believed that the sharp and steep increase in oil prices  in 1973 was carried out by the Gulf states as part of an anti-Israel and anti-US policy connected to the Yom Kippur war.  

Yet as we now know, the oil price rises were the result of US influence on the oil states and they were arranged in part as an exercise in economic statecraft directed against America’s ‘allies’ in Western Europe and Japan. And another dimension of the Nixon administration’s policy on oil price rises was to give a new role, through them, to the US private banks in international financial relations.

The Nixon administration was planning to get OPEC to greatly increase its oil prices a full two years before OPEC did so and as early as 1972 the Nixon administration planned for the US private banks to recycle the petrodollars when OPEC finally did take US advice and jack up oil prices.  

The Nixon administration understood the way in which the US state could use  expanding private financial markets as a political multiplier of the impact of US Treasury moves with the dollar. But according to the Nixon’s Ambassador in Saudi Arabia at the time, the principal political objective behind Nixon’s drive for the OPEC oil price rise was to deal a crippling blow to the Japanese and European economies, both overwhelmingly dependent on Middle East Oil, rather than to decisively transform international financial affairs. 

Nevertheless , Nixon’s officials  showed far more strategic insight into the consequences of what they were attempting than most political scientists would credit any government with. Its capacity for deception both over the oil price rise and in the way in which it manipulated discussions with its ‘allies’ in the IMF over so-called ‘international monetary reform’ was brilliant.

The US government realised that the oil price rises would produce an enormous increase in the dollar earnings of oil states that could not absorb such funds into their own productive sectors.

At the same time, the oil price rises would plunge very many states into serious trade deficits as the costs of their oil imports soared. So the so-called petrodollars would have to be recycled from the Gulf through the Western banking systems to non-oil-producing states.

Other governments had wanted the petrodollars to be recycled through the  IMF.  But the US rejected this, insisting  the Atlantic world’s private banks (at that time led by American banks) should be the recycling vehicles. And because the US was politically dominant in the Gulf, it could get its way...

 Locative for Animate nouns 

Hi, this article is very interesting and well-written.  One point, I'm a bit mystified as to why there is no locative case for """"the student"""".  Can this be amended, or can it be explained why there is no locative for animate nouns?  """,0
""" For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the """"Kumite"""" tournament.

Does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside Dux's testimony? Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.

Dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest """"kick with a knockout"""" at 72 mph. This makes no sense whatsoever. Is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? A 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. Someone wouldn't just """"jump into"""" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.

The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. His own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. You gotta be kidding me. Dux sued them for libel and lost.

He also sued Jean Claude Van Damme, saying that he (Dux) had come up with the story for the movie """"The Quest"""", and that Van Damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. Dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. Van Damme's lawyer ripped Dux's credibility to shreds, showing that Dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was, and produced a cast of witnesses to support that Dux is a story teller and pathological liar.

In his book, Dux goes on to make other astounding claims about being a real life James Bond character working for the CIA during the 80's, and many more fantastic tales. The publisher (Harper Collins) pulled the book, and not due to poor sales either. Maybe because they realized they had been duped by this guy, just like the producers of the movie Bloodsport. Just goes to show how little credibility Hollywood has, even when they make the claim that something is based on a true story. 71.233.140.67 (talk) 

    * First, let me say I agree with you. I want to make that clear, because you're not going to like the answer I have to give you. Read WP:TRUTH and one of the first things you will see is: """"Truth is not the criteria for inclusion of any idea or statement in a Wikipedia article, even if it is on a scientific topic. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true."""" I don't like that. You probably won't either, but that is the state of affairs. Those excellent questions you asked? Those are considered original research WP:OR. If someone else asks them in a reliable source, then we can add that to this article. But until they do, we can't. Although we can all edit here, we don't own Wikipedia. So when Dux disagrees with something and decides to sue, he doesn't come after Niteshift36 (although he might try), he comes after Wikipedia. The standard for biographies of living people WP:BLP is even higher than for articles about the deceased or other topics. I can't, for example say that Mr. John Doe is a lying a-hole on Wikipedia if he is still alive. I can't even say it on a talk page or my own user page. But if a writer in Time magazine does an interview where his former boss calls Doe a lying a-hole, we can possibly include that. There are a lot of people who have asked the questions you did. I",0

Jesus and Messianic Prophecy
Hey, you removed my addition to this section. I don't get it. You were vague, and mentioned how you didn't like my use of the word """"retort"""". I wasn't trying to instigate some sort of battle between Jews and Christians or something, I was just reporting what the Christian counterargument is to certain Jewish opinions about Jesus (and note- I had referenced Bible passages). It is true- the Bible contains no time-line or deadline for the prophecies to work with. (If there is one then why don't you cite your source?) And the New Testament does give reasons as to why Jesus hasn't fulfilled certain prophecies, and talks about how he'll get to them later (eg, he will usher in the Messianic era of peace/God's kingdom after the apocalypse, as detailed in Revelation).

What really bugs me is how you allow, and even restored, false claims about Christianity on this page. There is a line that says, """"Contrary to the Christian belief that the Kingdom of God is not worldly..."""". I deleted it and explained how all the gospels, several epistles and the book of Revelation talk about how the coming kingdom of God IS going to be a literal physical thing on earth after a physical resurrection of the dead. I even put a reference (revelation 19-22)- this unambiguously spells out these points. 99% of all Christian denominations believe this.""",0

Its design would indicate it cannot climb stairs and there is no footage of the robot climbing stairs on youtube. It may well be that the robot can climb scale stairs of about an inch high, but this is not made clear and the implication is that the robot can climb domestic stairs.

 I've got a question about theropod height, and another about Dromaeosaurids... 

Well, 2 years ago, you gave me a hand with a school project I was working in by making this size chart.

Well, I managed to get the highest possible mark in that subject, so that compensated for some weaker marks, and I managed to enter University without much pressure, so thanks again. Anyway, I was recently surfing the web and I came across this image: http://kronosaurus82.deviantart.com/art/Biggest-Ugliest-Baddest-140881861 As you can see, the animals that appear in it are the same as in the size chart you made, however, we can see some discrepances in their height. So, my question is, is this reconstruction correct in this regard? Tyrannosaurids having longer leg bones that Allosauroids and Spinosaurids (and the latter having a lower profile that other theropods) is pretty common knowledge, and longer leg bones mean more height, but, still, the mounted skeleton of Sue is not that much taller that mounted Giganotosaurus, if I recall correctly, and the mount of Spinosaurus is quite massive...

Anyway, about Dromaeosaurs, do you have any idea about the environment Deinonychus and Utahraptor lived in? I ask, mainly, because of the whole feather density (or oven presence, in some cases, it seems), and, after seeing how you reconstructed Achillobator, and the reasoning behind the ratite feathering you gave it, I've been pondering how that could affect medium-large dromaeosaurs in less arid climates.

In any case, could I ask you a favour, if you have the time and the inmediate means? If yes, remember the giant bird size chart?  
Could you add a Velociraptor mongoliensis silouette to it, if you can? I mainly need it to driving a point straight home (not like it is that needed, the paper that describes the quill knobs on that genus is pretty good evidence for wings, but, still...). Again, if you have time. In any case, Deinonychus' height would be slighty higher if it adopted a more natural position that the crouching (or as so I see it, correct me if needed) one it is displaying in the chart. Also, do you think Aepyornis would be heavier that Utahraptor? Seeing that the model for estimating weights was deemed somewhat flawed, and that, at least in the chart, Aepyornis has a larger body, well, yeah...

By the way, I like how you classified Oviraptorosaurs as an order of Aves, and Deinonychosaurs as part of Archaeopterygiformes. It, well, makes sense, that classification should get more standariced. One tends to forget about those things when thinking in a cladistic way, but, that update would be something needed to change the overall image of those animals. I may start writting them in that way, well, when I get my licenciature and start doing actual work and research in place of preparing exams. Well, better that """"when"""", """"if"""", but I hope I do.

Anyway, keep up your good work, I've been following your blog, and I like what I read over there!

 Legl683 

Hi Peridon,

I have to respectfully disagree with part of the advice you have to a new user on User_talk:Legl6836#Help re. Emotion - viz.

Although the topic of the poll and subsequent messages is """"Founder"""" the term """"Founder"""" was not included as an option on the poll.

This message thread is 20 pages long  556 messages. So long in fact that a second thread called Founder part II was started. That thread is 1750+ messages long. More than a dozen is an understatement: 20 unique posters appear on the first two pages of part II. Even a cursory reading, however, shows that a consensus has not been reached. As late as yesterday this message appeared. It's pretty clear that the same faith-inspired contentiousness evidenced by Members who are editing this article is reflected on TMB as well even now.

 Maba Diakhou Bâ 

I first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.

The purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki's policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  

Maba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba's article.  

Maba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as
The Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)

The article did not give us the exact date he died and in the """"Death and legacy"""" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting """"1876"""" instead of """"1867"""". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph

In the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote """"He became leader Almamy in Saloum"""" and under the """"Resistance and Conquest"""" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote 
""""While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.""""

First of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been",0

Just a note of the corrections I made to the character section:

Under Full Moon, I added that in the final episode, she sings 'Love Chronicle' which was the third ending theme and the closing song of Full Moon's last concert.

Under Fuzuki, it said 'fiancee' which not only lacks the accent, but a double e is the feminine.

For Wakaouji, I explained when Takuto explained just after when Izumi tries to trick Mitsuki into jumping, he tells the doctor that he remembers the past and he was Route L's singer, and the agreement they made.

Under Madoka, it doesn't matter if two people audition with the same song. Eternal Song was planned as Madoka's debut single. Madoka's plan was that this way Full Moon wouldn't be able to sing the song at the same time, especially since they originally had the same producer. Since Mitsuki had her heart set on the song, she and Ooshige tried to get another producer. Eventually, under certain conditions, Wakaouji agrees to the job.

Also, in the anime, in one episode showing herself as a young child actress, she is shown to go through a lot before the anime began. Full Moon, on the other hand, rose to stardom with relatively little effort.",0

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  

I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.

"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.

The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.

I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.

I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. 

I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. 

As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t",0

Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis. Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports. Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics. Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told.

"Iranian Commanders
Lets Get something straight here; I will tell you who was really a commander on the Iranian Side. 

Ayatollah Khomeini- The Supreme leader controls the Army and the Pasdaran, so Khomeini is without a doubt a commander.

Ayatollah Khamenei- The president maintains some control over the army and while he reports to the Supreme Leader, he still welds significant control over their day to day operations, therefore Khamenei is Also a Commander

Mostafa Chamran- he was the Minister of Defense and a General under the Early stages of the war. He was killed in Action late in 1981. So he would have been sincerely a comander.

Ali Sayad Shirazi- Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces during the War, no question about his classification as a Commander.

Mohsen Rezaee- Commander of the Pasdaran, Heavily involved in the fighting, again, no question.

Now here are people who should not be classified as commander. 

Abdolhassan Banisadr- President but He was impeached in the first days of the war, so he never commandered anything during the War.

Mohammad Ali Rajai- President only for less than three weeks after Banisadr, so he never commandered anything. 

Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani- Throught his career as a cleric during the War, Rafsanjani never went into affairs regarding the military (exception being the Iran-Contra Affair) and simply worked with business within the country.

Mir Hossein Mousavi- The Prime Minister did not wield any power over the military, he simply worked exclusively on affairs within the country.

I know the elements articles are a PITA and involve a lot of defense from vandals and WP:NOR failers- it's not something I want to do. OTOH, it's a hard length to defend, based on my (non-elements) experience at RFPP. I'll dial it back and post a note on the talk page, but ultimately I won't be watching it, so feel free to change it back if it becomes necessary.

As far as """"amount of vandalism"""" is concerned, here are my top indications that protection is needed (see also: WP:ROUGH):
 Extreme vandalism (compare to the daily featured article, but generally > 5 unique IPs in 24 hours, or 3-4 unique IPs per day over a slightly longer period)
 Sockpuppetry, if protecting the article is easier than an IP/rangeblock. (see Pioneer Courthouse Square for an extreme example of this)
 BLP. This one is obvious. Especially for
 Unsourced fancruft. Usually this is for articles that are continually getting edit-warred about the genre of a band, or the rumor that someone won the latest season of Survivor, or pretty much any article related to wrestling/MMA.
 The squishy stuff: if an article is super-stable (compare diffs to 'cur', no productive changes over last 100 edits or N months) and the IPs never have anything to contribute.
The last one is really the sticking point. In the recent history of Vanadium (just looking to the 20th or so), I see two repeat-offender IPs and a couple of random ones. The repeat-offenders should be warned and blocked for a short time if they haven't been blocked before. If it were (was) me, I'd feel comfortable semi-protecting the article for 3 days, *maybe* a week if I was frustrated.
Finally, generally the semi-protection ramps up in length. So a common pattern I use is 3 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, then indefinite. Each time it should come unprotected and show big problems with IPs.
As an aside, I didn't mean for this to be so long, and apologies if you know all of this. I tried to cast it as a personal opinion because it somewhat *is*. And I'm being so verbose because you are a new admin (congrats, of course), and I'm hoping it helps without coming off condescending.

Ecuador (elected a Communist),
Argentina (elected a Communist sympathizer),
Algeria,
Morocco,
Tunisia,
Egypt,
Pakistan (the military dictator they have is ok to keep a lid on the Islamists, but he'll fall one day so we might as well occupy them),
Qatar (Al Jazeria is based there spewing its anti-American propaganda),
Tunisia,

""". This explains why defecation is frequently accompanied by urination, and why urination is frequently accompanied by flatulence.

Defecation may be involuntary or under voluntary control. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once this has been achieved, loss of control causing fecal incontinence may be caused by physical injury (such as damage to the anal sphincter that may result from an episiotomy), intense fright, excessive pressure placed upon the abdomen, inflammatory bowel disease, impaired water absorption in the colon (see diarrhea), and psychological or neurological factors.

The loss of voluntary control of defecation is experienced frequently by those undergoing a terminal illness.Joanne Lynn, MD. Merck.  October 2007.  Symptoms During a Fatal Illness.  Uploaded 3/1/09. 

Posture aspects

The positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. The natural and instinctive method used by all primates, including humans for defecation, is the squatting position. Squat toilets, sometimes referred to as 'natural-position toilets', are still used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.Kira A. The Bathroom. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976, revised edition, pp.115,116.  The widespread use of seated-position toilets in the Western World is a recent development, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor plumbing.A History of Technology, Vol.IV: The Industrial Revolution, 1750-1850. (C. Singer, E Holmyard, A Hall, T. Williams eds) Oxford Clarendon Press, pps. 507-508, 1958

Bockus Gastroenterology, the standard textbook on the subject, states:
""""The ideal posture for defecation is the squatting position, with the thighs flexed upon the abdomen. In this way the capacity of the abdominal cavity is greatly diminished and intra-abdominal pressure increased, thus encouraging expulsion ...""""Bockus. Gastroenterology. p. 754 2nd ed. Saunders, Philadelphia and London, 1964

Other considerations
The anus and buttocks may be cleansed with toilet paper, similar paper products, or other absorbent material. In some cultures water is used (e.g. as with a bidet or Lota (vessel)) either in addition or exclusively. In Japan and South Korea, some toilets known as washlets are designed to wash and dry the anus of the user after defecation (see anal cleansing).

 Section """"Reliability and bias"""" 

Wikipedia appeals to the authority of peer-reviewed publications rather than the personal authority of experts.
IMO this statement is false as it stands. Wikipedia can rely on personal authority of experts within their recognized area of expertize, as well as on the authority of government officials (i.e., experts in government), see WP:RS#Exceptions. The idea probably was """".. rather than on the personal authority of experts contribution ot wikipedia"""". In any case, what is """"the authority of peer-reviewed"""" other than the sum of the personal authorities of peers? `'mikka 

A drawback of this citation-only approach is that readers may be unable to judge the credibility of a cited source
An opinion, not a fact. requires reference. What is more, this statement is dubious: a drawback in comparison to what? Do readers """"judge"""" the credibility of EB authors? They simply accustomed to believe in credibility of EB. In fact, in certain areas EB is biased as hell. The most recent example that came to my attention is whitewashing their compatriot John Mills (In frief, EB says that Mills """"withdrew from the project"""" of Encyclopédie, while independent historians say he was kicked out and even banged on his head for his bad job) Secondly, we have WP:RS in place to ensure that verifiably credible sources are cited.  `'mikka """,0

  is a scientifically proven epitome of an Arsehole (stretched and itching...) THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia 

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0
"There is no reason to treat AFF and SF the same. The neutrality policy, which explicitly states that it is not to be confused with “all views deserve equal time no matter how many or how few people hold them”, certainly requires nothing of the sort – look it up yourself, I won’t do your homework for you.

 Moreover, the merits of AFF and the merits of SF are two entirely separate and independent things. No amount of slamming AFF – even if your charges are accurate, which I doubt as your behaviour here strongly suggests your perceptions on such things cannot be trusted – can ever, by itself, make SF worth including. SF must stand or fall on its own merits.

There are many serious strikes against including SF, none of which you have even tried to address. First of all it borders on being a blog, which is already an almost-decisive point against it (there was talk of banning links to blogs entirely at one point though it isn’t actually policy to do so as far as I know – certainly “it’s a blog” has stood uncontested as sufficient reason for deleting links on many pages, including the same one we’re fighting over). Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content. These three points – heck, any two of them – are sufficient reason leave the link off Wikipedia.

And I haven’t even mentioned the most important reason yet. Your site simply is not notable. As far as I can honestly tell, you are the only person on Earth who considers it an important site. If it was worth linking to, someone other than the site's owner would have done so by now, or at least spoken up in favour of such. That last part, at least, is well-documented Wikipedia policy; look it up yourself as I once again refuse to do your homework for you. 

I am sorry – sort of – if some of this comes across as harsh. Though you will no doubt characterize this note as a personal attack, it is not intended as such (and compared to some of the things you’ve posted about others, including me, it’s not even close to qualifying as one). I wish only to lay out as clearly as possible why there is little hope of SF being linked from that or any other Wikipedia page.",0

The focus of the animation is the CMYK model, which is a mathematical abstraction, and not the device dependency of any particular print process. I consider it helpful in the same way as the animations at the articles RGB color space and YCbCr are in explaining a 3-D volume that can be difficult to visualize from a static drawing.
 We cannot show subtractive ink colors accurately but that does not mean the article cannot have diagrams. The colors I used are the same as here and here i.e. 125 colors uniformly filling the displayable range and mapped to the CMK space. Note: this is not perfect, there is no gamma correction and linearity is assumed. If anyone likes to propose a different colour law in terms of 24-bit RGB shades, I can see about putting them in the animation.
 Just noticing that it is a spinning object tells the viewer it is something in 3-D. It helps to notice that the cube rotates about its diagonal which is the K axis. Then one understands the geometry.
 The goal is to give a qualitative visualization of how ink densities are coordinated like dimensions of a space. a) In principle three inks can define the whole gamut which is therefore a cube. The article explains that black ink is added to """"save money on ink"""" and to address the inadequacy of affordable CMK inks in very dark tones.

I think it is a forlorn expectation that any Wikipedia diagram can provide colorimetrically accurate color swatches. It is correct to show that the CMK trio of subtractive inks work, to a good first approximation, as orthogonal variables that define a color space.

I've archived all the previous discussion in preperation for extensive work on this article.  Hopefully the peer review can help use on our way to FA status.  I'll add my comments about what needs to be done shortly.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

 New layout 

I think we need a better layout, and this is what I propose (based on other religous pages):

Etymology
Originating from Sanskrit (śiṣya or śikṣā) or Pali (sikkhā).
Beliefs
One god - reference to what god is in Sikh thought, reference the Mul Mantra as underlying the characteristics of God
Thoughts on birth, death, reincarnation, karma - relation to dharmic faiths and crucially how Sikhism differs
Equality of people regardless of race, religion, caste etc,
History
General climate in India at the time
The Sikh gurus; placing special emphasis on Nanak as the founder, and Gobind Singh as the founder of the Khalsa
The Guru Granth Sahib
Influences in Sikhism post-Gurus (famous Sikhs like Banda Bahadur and Ranjit Singh).  Including influence of the British, and issue in independent India.
Scripture
Guru Granth Sahib (creation of, layout and content)
Dasam Granth (and controversy)
Janam Sakhis
Other scripture
Khalsa
Sikhs
Five Ks
Punjab and punjabi culture and how it relates to Sikhism
Sikhism in the diaspora
New Sikh converts
Institutions
Places of worship (Gurdwaras)
Harimandir Sahib, Akal Takht (spirtual and temporal - duties of both)
SGPC and other gurdwara administration committees
Sects and groups
Talk about differing groups of Sikhs (including caste distinctions which still persist contrary to Sikh teachings)
Udasis, Nirankaris and others

In addition, we need to get rid of the mass of links at the bottom of the page, as well as the audio files which are not relevant on this page.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

Pictures and Table

I don't see the need in having 2 pictures of men wearing turbans. I think one of them should be replaced by a picture of one of the 5 K's or maybe even a picture of a Guru.

Also, I think the order of the columns in the table containing information about the Gurus needs to be changed. I think all dates should be read in chronological order, which means that the """"Date of Birth"""" column should come before the """"Guruship on"""" column. This to me is a more logical order.
 

Yes, I agree with your comments.  We'll incorporate your commments in the re-write.  The dates of the Gurus also need fact checking and have been flagged for some while.   | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

Okay, all done.  Please check the new picture.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

That is a much better picture, thank you! There is something I am unsure about though and I hope someone can resolve the matter. In that table about the Gurus it says that Guru Nanak received his guruship the day he was born. Is this a widely accepted belief amongst the Sikh community? I ask because I had always thought that Guru Nanak became a Guru the day he emerged from the river Bain and said """"There is neither Hindu nor Muslim..."""" and recited the Mool Mantra for the first time. I am not entirely sure though. Am I mistaken to believe this?  

It could also be viewed that as there was nobody (well, apart from God I suppose), to pass their guruship onto him, he was a guru since birth.  I believe your way of looking at it is definately better and I will change it.  By the way, feel free to edit any of the articles on Wikipedia.  There are plenty of problems on the Sikhism-related pages and none were really written by scholars.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

 Styles 

I'm a bit unsure how to proceed with general styling in the article.

The Jazz Bird: Fact vs. fiction 
________________________________________

        Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird, is based on the 1927 murder trial of Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus. Here's a quick look at where fact and fiction converge and diverge: 
        George Remus, the killer 
        Fiction: A lawyer and pharmacist who comes to Cincinnati from Chicago in the 1920s with a scheme that makes him at least $20 million. He buys distilleries licensed to sell “medicinal” whiskey to drug companies and then sells the booze to dummy drug companies while shipping it to illegal customers. 
        Truth: A lawyer and pharmacist, he was a friend and co-counsel of famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow testified as a character witness for him at his trial. He came to Cincinnati from Chicago and turned a $10,000 investment into an estimated $80 million fortune in less than three years. He sold “medicinal” whiskey to legitimate drug companies he set up, then stole the whiskey from the drug companies. 
        Charlie P. Taft, the prosecutor 
        Fiction: He is the son of former United States President William Howard Taft and plans a career in politics. He fades away after losing the case. 
        Truth: He was the youngest son of the former president. He became Hamilton County prosecutor just a few months before the trial. His political career suffered a setback after the trial — he wasn't nominated for a second term as prosecutor. He did stay in politics, helping found the Cincinnati Charter Committee and serving as a councilman and mayor until his retirement almost 50 years later. He ran an unsuccessful race as a Republican for Ohio governor in 1952, the year George Remus died. 
        Imogene Remus, the victim 
        Fiction: She is the wealthy 25-year-old daughter of a high society family in Cincinnati. She is the wife of a World War I veteran left in a coma by a shell fragment when she meets George Remus. She tries, unsuccessfully to get Remus accepted by Cincinnati society. 
        Truth: She was a 35-year-old secretary in Chicago when she divorced her first husband to marry George Remus, who divorced his first wife to marry her. She entertained lavishly in Cincinnati in hopes of being accepted into Cincinnati society. The Cincinnati upper crust was willing to buy Mr. Remus' whiskey, but never accepted him, or his wife, as social equals. She was 39 when she was killed. 
        The trial 
        Fiction: George Remus defends himself, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. He plays to the press and frequently disrupts the proceedings, which are likened to a Vaudeville show by the Enquirer. The jury acquits him in 20 minutes, recommends his release from the hospital in time for Christmas and drinks up at a party he throws for them. 
        Truth: That's all true.

Logan duked out for AP honor 
________________________________________

The Associated Press 
        ATLANTA — UC's Steve Logan was third behind Duke's Jason Williams and Kansas' Drew Gooden in voting for The Associated Press college basketball player of the year. 
        UC's Bob Huggins was fifth in voting for coach of the year. 
        Logan received eight votes, Williams 38 and Gooden 18 from the 72-member national panel that selects the weekly AP Top 25. 
        Huggins got 7 votes behind Pittsburgh's Ben Howland (16), Bob Knight of Texas Tech (11), Ernie Kent of Oregon (10) and Roy Williams of Kansas (9). 
        Williams, the only unanimous All-America selection this season, is the second straight Duke player to be selected national player of year and the fifth Blue Devil to win the Adolph Rupp Award. 
        Shane Battier won last season. The other Duke players to be honored were Elton Brand in 1999, Christian Laettner in 1992 and Art Heyman in 1963. 
        Williams thanked his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, who missed the ceremony after undergoing hip replacement surgery on Wednesday. 
        “Being with Coach K the past three years is the best thing I could have ever asked for,” Williams said. “I owe him everything.” 
        Williams, a junior also voted to the All-America team as a sophomore, averaged 21.3 points, 3.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists for the defending champion Blue Devils (31-4), ranked No. 1 for all but four weeks this season. He shot 45.7 percent from the field, including 38.3 percent from 3-point range. 
        Howland led the Panthers (29-6) to the most victories in school history, their first appearance",0

The prosecutors could be trying to gain support for their case by playing a """"racial game"""". The chances of that chapters members being all white is very high as most chapters are made up of friends/families and their friends of friends. No matter your skin colour, most people tend to have friends and family of their own ethnic background. The Hells Angels MC is a not a library, you do not go to a chapter and fill out an application form and then receive your membership card a week later. There is no actual proof that one of the chapters requirements was being a white male. If you go to Thailand the chances of their chapters being all Siamese is very high for the same reasons. Does that make being Siamese a requirement for membership? If you are going to make some racist wording like that, why exclude another Chapter like the Belfast Hells Angels which was started by those from the Chosen Few MC which was started by black Americans?

As reviewing administrator,  I think saying someone is a professor at Georgia Tech is at least a possible indication of notability, so I did not delete the article. But you need to add more information to show it, in our  Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  See also our standard, WP:PROF for what we consider notable in articles of this sort. 

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style. List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Web of Science. Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. 

If the person has any notable students who would qualify for Wikipedia bios, include them. Their PhD & postdoctoral advisors probably also qualify for bios here; add them and link them, even if they do not yet have articles. 

It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give any actual references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference.

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles. Avoid WP:Peacock terms.

Checks and Balances in the Articles for Deletion Nomination Process
There needs to be better checks and balances in the process of how articles are currently nominated for deletion, to prevent notable topics from being deleted without actual qualification per Wikipedia article deletion guidelines. This is a significant problem, because it is very likely that notable topics are being injustly deleted. It's easy to nominate an article for deletion and then type five or six words and wait to see if an article will be deleted, whereas it takes more time to refute nominations. Perhaps there should be more sophisticated criterion to nominate articles for deletion. As it is now, anyone can nominate any article without providing a just rationale for doing so, and can instead simply base the nomination upon basic, generic and inspecific statements such as """"doesn't pass general notability guidelines"""", while not specifically stating which parts of the guidelines they are supposedly referring to. If nobody comes along to correct an injust or baseless nomination, the article is then deleted based upon unqualified, general statements that don't actually correspond with the required source searching per WP:BEFORE prior to nominating an article for deletion. This definitely makes it very easy for people to censor Wikipedia, for whatever subjective reasons. Here's how it's done: an article is nominated for deletion and an AfD entry is created, a generic rationale is provided to misqualify the deletion without actually checking for reliable sources to establish topic notability. Afterward, if nobody comes along to correct the faulty nomination, the article is deleted. It's also easy for people to message one-another to delete articles, often per an """"as per nom"""" rationale, while disregarding the actual notability of topics. If nobody comes along and provides an objective analysis to refute the deletion of an article in which the topic is actually notable, nominated per generic statements and without the required source searching prior to nomination, then the article disappears. Hopefully Wikipedia can introduce better checks and balances to prevent this type of easily accomplished, simple censorship. One idea is to include a requirement prior to article nomination for deletion in which the nominator has to state, or check-box on a template, that they've performed the required minimum search in Google Books and in the Google News Archive required by WP:BEFORE, and in Google Scholar for academic subjects, as suggested in WP:BEFORE. This would be a simple addition to the AfD nomination process that would add significant integrity to the process, and would also encourage users to follow the proper procedures.

Again, the discussion about the use of the term """"states"""" belong to other talk pages.

There is no any reason why delete the total number of recognitions. It is a logical first information in the intro. On the contrary, there is no reason why the number of UN members in acknowledging the intro article placed twice.

Ossetia here is redundant, this is an article about the recognition of the SADR, but not of S.Ossetia. Who cares about the recognitions of S.Ossetia, makes use the link or template, and peeks at the appropriate page.

To clear the total number of received recognition, duplication of information about UN members, detailed information about one peripheral recognizer – it's not a meaningful editing, which would have contributed to this.

 I encourage you to read that essay carefully. WP is a great resource. It is an amazing resource. It is additionally useful, helpful, unprecedented, and perhaps even world changing! I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve """"theory"""" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to """"the former Phlogiston theory"""" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. 
For 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable.

His idea can be seen from the first three (of six) Chapters in his """"Contents"""". In particular in Chapter II.3 he defines his normal algorithm (see sub-section below) in terms of a set of symbols that form words, and a method using substitution rules to create new but valid words.

Although this sounds exactly like a """"recursive language"""" (""""Equivalence of a type 0 grammar to a Turing Machine"""" cf Hopcroft and Ullman p. 221, Introduction to Automata theory, Languages and Computation, Addison-Wesley, 1979) nowhere do Hopcroft and Ullman cite Markov, neither in their index nor in their bibliography.

 Nutshell description of Markov's definition of his """"normal algorithm"""" (pp.63ff) 

In particular, the notion """"2."""" of """"steps of local nature"""" appear also in Blass and Gurevich with regards to Kolmogorov-Uspensky (KU) machines:
Gurevich proposed to Uspensky that """" 'every computation, performing only one restricted local action at a time, can be viewed as (not only  being simulated by, but actually being) the computation of an appropriate KU machine.' Uspensky concurred."""" (Blass, Gurevich 2003, p. 10)

Markov's definition:  

""""1. Separate elementary steps, each of which will be performed according to one of these rules...""""

""""2. ...steps of local nature ..."""" [as opposed to """"integral nature"""" ... he means that the algorithm won't change more than a certain number of symbols to the left or right of the observed word/symbol ]

""""3. Rules for the substitution formulas ...""""
 1) order given is their preferred order of use
 2) apply substitution to the first entry of the left-hand member

""""4. Definite prescription for termination...""""
 1) a means to distinguish a """"concluding substitution""""
 2) """"simple""""

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since. 

""""Those who have maintained this continuity are the true inheritors of the noble ideals of 1916.""""  """,0

I didn't make a personal attack, first of all.  I reverted that section because for a moment I thought I was on the """"Crucifixion"""" page and not the """"Crucifixion in Art"""" Page, and therefore when I realized my mistake, I realized that yes, in fact Anime can be considered relevant to this page, so I took out a portion where I said it didn't belong in this article.  I didn't make any personal attacks, I made a general statement that Anime Fans who think that Anime is culturally relevant to anyone but them really need to grow up.  I justified that by stating that even in its country of origin, it's irrelevant and viewed as immature Children's Programming.
Second, I think I did make my case.  Self-censorship is not actually censorship.  If I choose not to say something because I'm afraid of the backlash, nobody has censored me, so claiming that 'Westerners have censored completely justifiable depictions of crucifixion in anime' when in fact, it was the companies that censored themselves does nothing except engender a victim mentality among Anime Fans.

An interesting comment:  """"Convict leasing isn't the same as slavery where there's ownership and title. However, I would agree that we could amend the lead to read: """"effectively abolished slavery...""""

True there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. One ended w/ the 13th amendment, and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment (not the Corwin Amendment of 1861). In other words, what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in California, Oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the """"involuntary servitude"""" clause? WWhat do you think they were referring to? 

Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point. This is FAR from original research, and there are other scholars who've written about it. Now I haven't edited the article nor will I unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here, but I'd like to know the issue as it is now. How do other editors feel? 

One other thing, American historians do not always agree on things, and I have noticed at least one conspicious neo-Confederate argument in the article (unsourced), though on a different part of the article. So yes it's important to look at historians, but on some topics there's a whole lot of rubbish, particularly w/ slavery issues, so a consensus by historians may never happen, and sadly ideological agendas do exist, and I understand what you blokes mean about good sources. I'd say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important.  15:00, 18 July""",0

I feel that the first photo is a much better representation of the breed, and therefore, a better photo for the infobox. On a slightly diferent topic, can anyone get a photo of a husky standing? I think that a standing photo would be the best way to show the sonformation of the breed.",0

It is indeed necessary to define free will and it is easy. I think it is a big mistake to announce that """"This article covers the non-theological aspects of free will"""" as the root of the concept is at least partly theological. 
Immediately recall that the very point of free will is to jusitify moral responsibility (historically, despite the fact that a perfect and omniscient god created man).
Then warn the reader that a perrenial source of confusion has been about the (apparent) randomness or non-determination in human choices and that this point will be adressed seperately because both """"aspects"""" of free will are (apparently) at odds.
Then, maybe after some historical notes introduce compatibilits' (at least Hume-like) free will  the ability to choose in agreement to one's principles (or main goals). The point of this definition is to found moral responsibility (ability to include the threat of punishment into one's decision process).
Once this definition has been given the rest of the issues are much clearer and especially the fact the some limited (macroscopic) determinism is required to give sense to it. 14:09, 3 October""",0

 sock puppets 
 I'm accused of having multiple accounts by Noclador in his bizarre digging up of diffs (man, this guy has no life whatsoever) and then that sticks as me using sock puppets?  He makes these statements like, """"Furthermore there is socketpuppetry: user:Viewtool, user:Account101, user:Wikifun-usa, user:Nospu, user:Infinity88, user:Jamesbozen, user:Rossifumi-gp and user:Mud-miner were all incarnations of Icsunonove with which he tried to manipulate votes regarding the naming of locals in South Tyrol ceckuser results at bottom of this page"""".  What?  I never used any such accounts.

 It is amazing that Wikipedia lets this person, who is obsessively attacking another user, continue without criticism.  This person has such an extreme amount of time on his hands that he attempts to catalog diffs against another user, even surmising (with absolutely no proof) what accounts may belong to a user that are literally years old.  That this user has a Myspace page like Noclador, that has a statement such as """"noclador is ever victorious -)"""" should demonstrate what small-minded intentions he has in life.  I do pity him.  That users like PhJ and Gryffindor back him up are no surprise.  Gryffindor, as I've said before, is one of the most unethical Administrators I've ever witnessed on Wikipedia.

"Another issue / suggestion 

I noticed another issue that I guess it's not listed anywhere: when some articles start getting big and full of information, wikipedia users refrain from deleting weak or even nonsense parts. They believe it's good to keep all that (useless?) stuff, probably reasoning that some information is better than none. That's why many many articles get huge and are tagged to need the attention of an expert (who would hopefully clean up all the junk).

I strongly disagree with this behavior of keeping junk on the main page. I guess the editing system should allow two versions of an article: the main one, with the information that was agreed by everyone (intersection of information) and another, longer one with all the possible information for that subject (union of information). In this way people would not be so afraid of deleting junk because it would be stored on the second page, and the main article would always be a cleaned up version, which, if not complete, at least would not fail on quality.",0

Fair use rationale for Image:Foxddset.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Foxddset.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

"Hi, Baz! I know that Terrorizer is a world-wide known and very well selling magazine, I’m not a kid or crazy guy. I just mean that if they don’t know (or just pretend that don’t know) that Lucifugum is one of the most known East European black metal bands and give them just a half of a sentence of 3 pages they don’t look terribly competent in this subject. Just in this subject, I don’t talk about their whole competence. Don’t you agree?  As for the album a year on own label: Lucifugum is a self-releasing band just last 5 years (of 15 years existence). And it doesn’t make them less notable than they were in past. In interviews they explained their decision to make self-releases. It’s just because of a disappointment in labels which didn’t keep their word and promises (but NOT because of lack of interest to the band). “Vector 33” (the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum) was planned to be released on Drakkar prod., but  Drakkar didn’t release it in due time. That’s why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released “Vector 33” cd by themselves. It was the first Propaganda cd release. Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they don’t exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles. By the way, “Stigma Egoism” on Drakkar prod. is not a re-release, this is the first (and last at the moment) cd edition of this album (Propaganda released just tape version). Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetal.Com on cd format (a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might). I mean a critery for musicans, Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels.    
P.S. They record an album a year (or almost a year) not just now, in early times they did the same things. Just look at their discography, they really work hard. By the way, my 1488 really means nothing, just nothing, believe you me or not. Thanks for your time and all the best.",0

"""== Blood fetish ==
Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:
 - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.
Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    

People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) 

It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"I've never done anything like this before, either"""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   

Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda

I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"assortative mixing"""" and """"risk tolerance"""" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)

I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"X does Y"""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   

Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   

It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk)

There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list """"The estate of Richard Wright"""" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as """"members"""" and not """"former members"""". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as """"former members"""". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased. Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed.  """,0

""":Clayc, that's not a list of evolutionary biologists who dispute evolution, nor of ones who dispute it for scientific (as opposed to religious) reasons; according to the website you provided, it's a list of """"Creationists holding DOCTORATES IN SCIENCE"""". Are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of Evolution because creationists aren't banned from getting doctorates? That's rather silly indeed.
Creationism is a personal religious belief; it has nothing to do with science. There is no scientific evidence for creationism, and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The problem here isn't that you're trying to dispute evolution by linking to a Christian website (after all, Christians can do science too); rather, it's that you're trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. Creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than Mormonism or Hinduism or Trinitarianism does. It is scientifically (and biologically) unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons, and creationism is a religious movement, based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible, not on scientific observations. If you think that the Book of Genesis (or any religious movement based on it) is science, you gravely misunderstand the meaning of """"science"""".
Also, that's an amazingly short list, considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates.. And how many people on that list are actually biologists?
Also, a """"criticisms"""" section is a bad idea, though a related article is currently under construction: Objections to evolution. When it's finished, it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered. It's not a scientific topic, however, but a social and historical one, so it will have little mention in the top-level article, Evolution. -

King Air article
Bill, sorry for not responding sooner to your question about the military versions of the 90, and the general length of the article. I've been mulling it over, and I'm still not sure what would be best, but I'm wondering about splitting the article into one about the 90/100 series and another about the 200/300 series. That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by """"Super King Air"""", and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two """"families"""", the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  """,0

 Sound of jewellery 

The sound of jewellery has played an enermous part in many stories, poems, and religious literature (more details and sources to come).
Different jewellery creates different sounds, ie plastic bangles create a high pitched clink sound, while others such as baxelite produce
a """"clunck"""" sound. Knowing how a particular piece of jewellery sounds can help someone identify whether or not a piece of jewellery is fake.
Indeed people have written about the sound of """"fake gold"""", and jewel makers such as Sharon Alouf, a famous jeweler have praised the high frequency pitched noise of gold bangles(most likely real gold she is wearing). To this day, the jeweler claims, """"the sound of bangles clinking together is very soothing to me. It always reminds me of motherhood.""""Alouf is even partial to particular tones. """"Gold produces my favorite sound,"""" she says, """"the pitch is higher and clearer, which I find energizing.""""

MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking the romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

 More information on Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry 
The following quotes regarding Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry are from The Jewish Century by Yuri Slezkine (Princeton University Press, 2004) and could possibly be inserted in to this article in order to provide more references.

 """"But of course the most sensitive """"nationality"""" [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, """"I've always thought so,"""" to which Bukharin allegedly replied: """"Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?"""" What """"they,"""" or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact """"inappropriate for publication"""" and decree that it be """"kept secret."""" In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the """"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe"""" and """"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages""""; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism """"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses."""" Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar """"'tenacity' in struggle"""" and a highly revolutionary disposition. """"Generally speaking,"""" she concluded, """"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities."""" Stalin's response was an order to """"keep absolutely quiet."""" Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition"""" (pgs. 245–246)

 """"All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the """"great leaders of democracy and socialism"""" came from """"the best representatives of the Jewish world."""" Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and """"this fact"""" was """"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,"""" and that Lenin had always contrasted """"what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character.""""

I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews.

110th CONGRESS 1st Session S. RES. 300

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.

IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

August 3, 2007

RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) should stop the utilization of materials that violate provisions of the United Nations-brokered Interim Agreement between FYROM and Greece regarding `hostile activities or propaganda' and should work with the United Nations and Greece to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals of finding a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.

Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General Assembly admitted as a member the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), under the name the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia';

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 (1993) states that the dispute over the name must be resolved to maintain peaceful relations between Greece and FYROM;

Whereas, on September 13, 1995, Greece and FYROM signed a United Nations-brokered Interim Accord that, among other things, commits them to not `support claims to any part of the territory of the other party or claims for a change of their existing frontiers';

Whereas a pre-eminent goal of the United Nations Interim Accord was to stop FYROM from utilizing, since its admittance to the United Nations in 1993, what the Accord calls `propaganda', including in school textbooks;

Whereas a television report in recent years showed students in a state-run school in FYROM still being taught that parts of Greece, including Greek Macedonia, are rightfully part of FYROM;

Whereas some textbooks, including the Military Academy textbook published in 2004 by the Military Academy `General Mihailo Apostolski' in the FYROM capital city, contain maps showing that a `Greater Macedonia' extends many miles south into Greece to Mount Olympus and miles east to Mount Pirin in Bulgaria;

Whereas, in direct contradiction of the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord's section `A', entitled `Friendly Relations and Confidence Building Measures', which attempts to eliminate challenges regarding `historic and cultural patrimony', the Government of FYROM recently renamed the capital city's international airport `Alexander the Great Airport';

Whereas the aforementioned acts constitute a breach of FYROM's international obligations deriving from the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord, which provide that FYROM should abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage;

Whereas such acts are not compatible with Article 10 of the United Nations Interim Accord, which calls for `improving understanding and good neighbourly relations', as well as with European standards and values endorsed by European Union member-states; and

Whereas this information, like that exposed in the media report and elsewhere, being used contrary to the United Nations Interim Accord instills hostility and a rationale for irredentism in portions of the population of FYROM toward Greece and the history of Greece: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Senate

(1) urges the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to observe its obligations under Article 7 of the 1995 United Nations-brokered Interim Accord, which directs the parties to `promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by state-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility' and review the contents of textbooks, maps, and teaching aids to ensure that such tools are stating accurate information; and

(2) urges FYROM to work with Greece within the framework of the United Nations process to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals by reaching a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.",0

 No, I didn't liken you to a dog. That's just an expression that means things are going downhill, IOW civil fringe POV pushers are being handed concessions and being allowed to do things their own way more and more, in spite of recent improvements in the way we're supposed to handle fringe beliefs. In this case allowing a one-sided POV driven and dubious interpretation of a guideline to be used to violate my userspace. That was indeed uncivil and very impolite. Bang! Done! No discussion or request. I am shocked and disheartened by these actions by someone I respected. That's all. Was what I said uncomfortable for you? Sure, but not incivil. You have chosen your agenda and it is not incivil to point out what it is. You do it to me all the time without me running to mommy and complaining about incivility. When you're getting your way, you are very tough and civil. Somehow you expect that you can tread on people and just get away with it by calling their comments """"incivil"""". You really do misuse that card by playing it too often. When you become perfect, then you can start pointing fingers. Keep in mind that you have the dubious honor of being considered one of the most classic and highly skilled cases of a disruptive civil POV pusher. As I recall, you may have even been the pioneer developer of the technique. Your civility covers an agenda that is counterproductive to NPOV by inevitably seeking to wikilawyer, stonewall, and censure anything negative about chiropractic, no matter how well sourced, when we're actually supposed to follow the sources. That's just wrong. Since this is Tim's user page, it's probably best that this discussion not continue here (or even continue at all, since we never get anywhere). I just wanted to set the record straight that I certainly wasn't comparing you to a dog. I actually do have much higher opinions of you. I admire intelligence. I just wish it wasn't being used for such a nefarious and and non-NPOV purpose as """"to protect chiropractic's reputation"""".

Unholy alliance
An unholy alliance is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups, especially if one is religious, for ad hoc or hidden gain. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the public interest. An early, well-known use of the term was by Theodore Roosevelt (TR):
TAB 
""""To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."""" - 1912 Progressive Party Platform, attributed to TRO'Toole, Patricia, """"The War of 1912,"""" TIME in Partneship with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006. and quoted again in his autobiographyRoosevelt, Theodore. An Autobiography: XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, NEW YORK: MACMILLAN, 1913. where he connects Trusts and monopolies (sugar interests, Standard Oil, etc.) to Woodrow Wilson, Howard Taft, and consequently both major political parties.
TAB 
After the breakup of Standard Oil, TR lost the election, and the unholy alliance he had identified, oligopolies of a few big commodities corporations and their political allies, continued otherwise undeterred by the mutually beneficial indifference of both major political parties. In 1935, retired Marine Major General Smedley Butler described how this unholy alliance influenced U.S. foreign policy and how his job abroad had been to be a """"muscle man for big business."""" In 1944, conservative journalist John T. Flynn described how this unholy alliance uses religion to sell its agenda abroad to the American public:
TAB 
""""The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of larceny, murder, rapine and barbarism. We are always moving forward with high mission, a destiny imposed by the Deity to regenerate our victims while incidentally capturing their markets, to civilise savage and senile and paranoid peoples while blundering accidentally into their oil wells.""""Flynn, John T. (1944) As We Go Marching. p. 240
TAB 
A reference to this unholy alliance today is:
TAB 
Unholy Alliance, a review by PBS journalist, Rev. Dr. Allen Dwight Callahan of
TAB 
Phillips, Kevin (2006) American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century, Viking Press.

"""

In the past there was no such nation as """"Germany"""". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as """"Brandenburg"""", """"Saxony"""", """"Hanover"""" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like """"Hanoverian"""" and """"Bavarian"""" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just """"German"""" or """"Deutsch"""". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture """"Bavarian"""" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name """"Macedonia"""", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein""",0

"About English: Some of your complaints have been fixed. Other examples are idiomatic to mathematics writing, and hence may not be fixed.
About jargon: Mathematics, like any highly technical field, has its own jargon, which does not appear in non-mathematical dictionaries. Part of the function of Wikipedia is to explain and exemplify jargon for readers, so that they can understand other texts that use such jargon.
About difficulty: This is a common complaint about mathematics articles on Wikipedia. (See FAQ at the top of the project talk page here.) This Projective plane article is not a bad offender, in comparison to many other articles. It attempts to give visual intuition, historical context, applications, etc. The later parts of the article are more obscure, but only highly motivated readers will attempt those anyway. Fundamentally, this is an article about a moderately advanced mathematical topic, that few non-mathematical laymen ever encounter. So the difficulty seems about right to me.

 If He Was Terrorist 

Czech President Miloš Zeman has criticized Ukrainian leaders Stepan Bandera (1909-59) and Roman Shukhevych (1907-50), saying he cannot congratulate Ukraine on such national heroes in his response to an open letter by four Ukrainian studies scholars and historians.

Zeman asks them at the beginning of his letter whether they know Bandera’s statement “Kill every Pole between 16 and 60 years” and whether they agree with it.
If you have not heard these words by Bandera, you are not ukrainists. And if you know about that statement, then do you agree with him or not? If you agree, then our debate is over"""" - wrote Zeman. He continues saying Bandera wanted to establish a vassal German state in the Ukraine.   http://www.praguepost.com/world-news/43706-zeman-criticizes-historical-ukrainian-leaders 

That cannibalistic statement alone brings Badera into the 1st rank terrorists with plans of henocide (a crime agains humanity), let alone many terrorist actions under his command, for example in Poland.

According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

I really don't know where you count 3 sentences on the flood myth in the Epic of Gilgamesh - the tablet 11 section is longer than any other and has far more than 3 sentences.
You are again right in saying this article is not about flood myths in general - that's the Deluge (mythology) article. This article's purpose is to show how this flood story diverges from a preferred reading derived from the Atra-Hasis version - a river flood, a certain barge etc. What would be a compare-and-contract is divided into two sections """"Sentences copied"""" and """"Material altered"""", and doesn't include any other versions.
All this article does is present arguments against how the Gilgamesh episode differs from the Atra-Hasis flood story, and its unique reading as presented in the """"Alternative translations"""" section. This page should simply be redirected to the Epic of Gilgamesh.

"The fact that the students in Waldorf schools in California have personal exemptions from immunizations at a higher rate than the state average is fact, verified by the State of California statistics which I ref'd.

The schools can claim that this is not an official policy, but I did not argue that it is official policy, only that the numbers are true and that they are verifiable.

 Heli-Coil Marks 

Can you please explain why you reverted my edits?

You state that the previous statement (""""helical inserts, more commonly known by the tradename Heli-coil..."""") is correct. 

It is not.  HELI-COIL is a trademark, not a tradename.  And it is owned by Emhart Teknologies: See U.S. Trademark Registration Nos. 2987760, 0514560, 0759898, 0707397, 0419109, 0419476, and 0399390.  

Also, there is no citation for the proposition that all helical inserts are """"commonly known"""" as HELI-COIL inserts.  It is not that the inserts are commonly known as HELI-COIL inserts, it is that a well-known brand of helical inserts is the HELI-COIL brand.

Please explain.

To continue the Smith story, I found the book Men Against the Mountains, by Alson J. Smith (1965). I would have preferred Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West, by Dale L. Morgan (1953), but my local library didn't have it. Because both books were written prior to the 1967 discovery of the """"lost"""" journal, they both contain some errors in particulars of the 1826-27 travel route that were corrected in Brooks' book (1977). Facts were established earlier, however, for J. Smith's 1827 return to California and the completion of the expedition at Fort Vancouver.

I found that J. Smith visited San Jose, Monterey and Yerba Buena, California before heading north up the Sacramento Valley. The Alson Smith book doesn't give the exact route of travel from San Jose to Monterey, but it seems unlikely that the expedition passed through my home turf in Santa Cruz County (my original question). They probably used the more established El Camino Real by way of Mission San Juan Bautista.

This would say that my edit was seen as vandalism, or I have done other serious inappropriate behavior.

""" 2009 (UTC)

Mel Bay may cite Marlow as """"something of an authority on the ten-string guitar"""", but also as something of an authority on the ten-string guitar I have reviewed her approach guide and found it misinformative in the following respects:
 
1. In the front matter, Janet Marlow claims that """"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar"""". In truth, Narciso Yepes always, verifiably stated that there are eight notes (from the twelve that make the chromatic octave) that do not have string resonance (i.e. a sympathetic response from an adjacent string). This can be verified in practically any of his various articles and interviews as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: """"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale."""" That is not only on six-string guitars. Also ten-string guitars that do not have the specific tuning invented by Yepes cannot lay claim to having unison sympathetic string resonances for all the twelve notes in all positions on the treble strings. This is an indisputable fact of acoustics, a science, which as such cannot be fudged.

2. Marlow does not define the term """"resonance"""", which is used in this book in the lay sense rather than in its acoustic/scientific sense. This is evident from the chapter on """"Controlling Resonance"""" in which controlling """"resonance"""" is equated with a vibrating bass string that has been actively plucked. In fact, this is not string resonance, but simply a vibrating string. Resonance is the tendency of a system (like a string) to vibrate sympathetically at a particular natural frequency in response to energy induced at that frequency (that is, on another string). 

3. No adequate explanation of how this resonance actually functions is offered anywhere in this book. In fact, the singular tuning that adds all eight missing resonances is relegated to an aside comment in parenthesis. In addition, it is claimed that the author's """"own"""" method of tuning """"satisfies the needed sustain"""" (Preface). As a fact of acoustics, the author's tuning system does not provide sympathetic string resonance for all the notes of a chromatic scale, nor does it thus equalize the sustain, resonance, timbre, or volume among the twelve notes of the octave (which is the entire primary purpose behind the invention of the modern 10-string guitar). The tuning system used in this method, for example, supplies no resonance for the notes of F-natural and B-flat, neither does it offer any resonance for C's. 

4. In the Preface, Marlow claims that """"In my own process over twenty five years I have developed the tuning"""" that forms the basis for this method. In fact, this method of tuning had already been fully developed by 1982, not """"over twenty five years"""". Records of this are in the March 1982 edition of Guitar Player magazine, in an interview with Marlow by Allan Kozinn. Furthermore, this concept is therein attributed to Oscar Castro-Neves (March 1982: 20), not to Janet Marlow's """"own process"""". 

5. The transcriptions of baroque music (by Bach and Weiss) offered in this book are fraught with stylistic problems too numerous to list but for a few. For example, the ornaments (which are an integral part of baroque music) have been inexplicably omitted (eg. trills in bars 8 and 15 of the Weiss Courante). Furthermore, stylistically inappropriate melodic intervals have been introduced in the bass line. For example, in bars 1-3 of the Courante, instead of the smooth bass line moving by steps from A2 to G#2 [minor 2nd] to F#2 [major 2nd]) - as intended by Weiss in good baroque style - we find erratic leaps of an augmented octave [A2 to G#1] and a minor 7th [G#1 to F#2]. Where this descending line should be structurally mirrored in bars 36-38, we find again an erratic undermining of the formal and stylistic elements of the composition, simply to keep the bass notes on open strings. As such it seems rather insincere that the author lists """"the correct use of octaves and bass lines intended by the composer"""" as a justification for using the 10-string guitar when this is clearly not the case in her own use of the instrument. Also, very little consideration seems to be shown for open basses ringing together where they should not, for example, the first three bass notes of the Courante all continue to ring together forming two dissonances (augmented octave and minor 7th) where the composer intends a clean line in the bass. That is, the bass line should be a melody, not a cacophany of dissonant harmonic intervals. (I refer also the the DVD version of this book, now discontinued, on which Marlow performs her transcription.)

"===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=

Dear Tiptoety,

I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.

This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. 

It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  

Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  

the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  

Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:

“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”
Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? 

The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u",0

There were, after all, examples were the workers' movement was set back twenty years because of bad timing, provocation and over-eagerness, and there have been voices trying to insinuate that the workers' state and the international workers' movement are not walking side by side on the path of socialism, but rather accomplices in an imperialist plot.

"""== Discussing recombination ==

Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.

Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    

I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   

 Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America' 

""""A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""    

That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?

Not relevant here. The Evolution article is not about Charles Darwin, the film is not about evolution, and there is an entirely separate page for the creation–evolution controversy. Please don't post sociological trivia on the Talk page of a biology article. (Also, evolutionary theory does not have """"loopholes."""") -  """,0

I would just like to point something out.  As a long practicing Wiccan, I was incredibly offended by the remarks of the obviously Christian person several posts above who makes the claim that witchcraft comes from the devil.  One of the most basic rules to Wicca is """"to give evil a name is to give it power"""".  Therefore, true Wiccans do not believe in a devil or a hell that bad people are sent to.  To explain the idea of afterlife that we believe in would take up quite a bit of space, and I am not trying to sway anyone to my beliefs.  I respect all religions and all people, and I do have an open mind to new people and beliefs.  However, my mind is not so open that my brain is going to fall out.  I have been persecuted for my unorthodox beliefs, losing friends over it because I did not want to convert to their religion.  Eshmasesh, I agree with you completely, however, there is not a set number of deities to worship in modern Wicca.  The God and the Goddess are very important, but there is also the All (or Spirit).  Worshipping nature is a common facet of many Wiccan branches in modern times, as is the belief that true balance can only be achieved by nature.  As for the multiple deities, Wicca is a polytheistic religion, and there are many branches to choose from.  In branches such as Khemetic (Egyptian Wicca) and Alexandrian (Greek) Wicca, you can devote an entire ritual to one specific God, like Aphrodite or Horus, or encompass several.  The choice is entirely up to the worshipper.  I know that there are teenagers who dress in all black and lots of jewelry and proclaim themselves to be witches, but they are nothing of the sort.  This is not saying that witches don't dress in black and wear jewelry, some may.  But Wicca as a religion, not a fad, requires hard work and dedication.  I look forward to the day that Wicca and all Pagan religions are as widely accepted as Christianity, but I am not holding my breath.  I just ask that Christians try to practice open-mindedness as much as they preach it.  The world would be a better place if more people were open-minded.

Errr...Joanot, who told you that you have binding authority to establish votings which by-pass wikipedia policies and, not happy with that, fixing deadlines etc? Did you see yourself like a neutral editor or an administrator taking care of this page? Because you are not either, are you?

You can organize as many polls as you want, establish very strict deadlines, limiting the answers to YES or NO, etc. All very impressive. But you just can't by-pass the wikipedia policies nor the consensus we had reached here over the months just because you would like to rewrite the article in each and every contentious points (about the rest, you never cared in the slightest). All like if many different editors wouldnt have worked on that (including you) and like if all the work and agreements were, all of a sudden, worthless just because you think so. It doesnt work like that, Mr.

There are two very clear policy guidelines below in the last """"Once Again"""" thread which you havent bothered to reply, didnt you notice them? or maybe is it so much more fun to organize a poll and email everybody and their grandmother from ca:wiki which you think will support your point of view rather than stickign to boring policy rules?. Or maybe you noticed these two policies but, since you are a smart guy, you looked the other way and made like if they werent there because they are definite and crystal clear, even if you dont like them (at least I agree with you in that polls are definitely much more entertaining than wikipedia policies, but life is life and there are some rules to abide, even if you dont like them)

In any case, whether you like them or not, policies are binding, and, fortunately they are clear enough in this case.

As for polls, do you know this other policy? WP:DEMOCRACY? let me quote it for you just in case, because it seems made for you:

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary method of determining consensus is through editing and discussion, not voting. Although editors occasionally use straw polls in an attempt to test for consensus, polls or surveys may actually impede rather than assist discussion. They should be used with caution, if at all, and will not be treated as binding.

So now we have three policies against your wishes to rewrite this article the way you would like it. Three policies against nothing but a lot noise and a massive attack to the existing consensus which generally works well for everybody, except for you.

Byrgenwulf has been making unsupported, unverifiable attacks on the topic of this article. Indeed, in clear violation of Wikipedia policy regarding neutrality and verifiability, both of you have been attacking the content, or topic, of the article rather than the article itself. All that the article has to do is faithfully report what appeared in the press and was written by Langan; given the clear notability of the content, you have no right whatsoever to carp and complain about it, at least in the capacity of Wikipedia editors acting in good faith. All you can do is report what other sufficiently notable people have said about the theory in sufficiently reputable and verifiable sources. If you choose to carp and complain anyway, particularly in a way that influences how the article is edited - after all, voting for deletion amounts to attempting to edit the article, right out of existence in fact, and likewise for encouraging others to vote as you do - then you are yourself in contempt of Wikipedia policy, and it is hypocritical of you to complain when you get the worst of it.

Instead of supporting his (and your) claims, as is your editorial responsibility, Byrgenwulf ignored his responsibility and attempted to infuse his attacks with authority by claiming to be a professional philosopher of physics. He did this both voluntarily and dishonestly, and that is now a proven fact. Once you have been shown to be something, that's it - anybody can point it out, as many times as he or she likes. If Byrgenwulf has been shown to be dishonest, or not an expert as he claims to be, anyone is free to state as much whenever convenient. Wikipedia policy is not just something that people like Byrgenwulf, and you, and jeffire, can point to when you don't like the way things are going for you, but then ignore whenever you can get away with it. It is something that applies to you as well. 

Incidentally, although you may think that I find your supercilious comments about philosophy impressive, this is anything but the case. Quite the opposite, in fact. I am quite certain, on the basis of your snide and shallow comments, that your level of philosophical understanding is nothing to respect. In fact, it may even be as deficient as Byrgenwulf's own. Please bear this in mind as you attempt to do the Wikipedia community, and the world at large, a monumental disservice by attacking a valuable, informative, and well-referenced article on a notable topic just to strike a blow for your own inability to comprehend it while meanwhile advancing your own opinions.

The difference between Gas Piston and Direct Impingement technology for an AR-15

Posted by Stag Arms on Fri, Sep 06, 2013 

The AR-15 Rifle, while eminently customizable, carries with it a few conundrums. One is the choice of operating system; do you get a model which uses gas piston technology, or the more traditional direct impingement? 

Fans of the gas piston will state that impingement models are prone to jamming and often foul easily. Fans of the impingement model will call gas piston tech mechanically unsound. Who is correct, and what is the real difference between the model types here?

Basic AR Functionality – What makes an AR-15 an AR-15?

To qualify as an AR-15, a rifle must be self-loading, and be able to perform a specific set of basic functions mechanically, without user assistance. To be more specific when depressing the trigger, the rifle needs to fire a single cartridge, and then extract that spent case from the chamber and eject it in some manner. Next, it must then load an unspent cartridge into the chamber. The round is plucked from the magazine, the breech is then locked, and the hammer cocked. The rifle will then have a fresh round loaded, and again be ready to fire.
 
Direct Impingement – How do the original AR-15 models work?

Direct Impingement is the original technology, devised by Eugene Stoner. Propellant gas is bled through a small hole located in the barrel, which is then channeled through a very small tube where it can proceed to directly contact (or impinge) the bolt carrier mechanism. At this point the gas is pushed to the rear of the rifle, and the spent case is extracted and ejected. It is then pushed forward by spring-loaded action, and strips an unspent round from the cartridge, loading it directly into the chamber of the barrel. Contrary to the statements of Gas Piston proponents we have put over 2000 rounds through rifles without cleaning and without malfunction.

 

Gas Piston Technology – How do the new piston technologies work?

Gas piston technology was first used in modern firearms by Mikhail Kalashnikov on the AK-47. While similar at first blush to direct impingement systems, there are a few key differences in operation. The firing process again begins with propellant gases being bled into the barrel. However, instead of being forced into a tube as it is in a direct impingement system, it is contained in a separate cylinder. 

This cylinder contains a piston(similar in operation to what you may find in an AK-47). The gas moves the piston, is in turn pushes the bolt carrier rearward to handle the extraction and ejection process, and then is moved pushed forward to the closed position by a spring just as with direct impingement.

 

ar-15

 

Which system is better?

The direct impingement has proven itself through the years on the AR-15 platform and replacement parts are inexpensive, easy to obtain, and generally made to a set “mil-spec” standard.  Due to the hot gas from the fired cartridge being redirected into the action it will quickly heat up and become dirty requiring a cool down period before the bolt carrier can be removed from the rifle.

The action of a piston rifle remains cool and clean, even after shooting 100 rounds in rapid succession. The bolt carrier can be removed immediately and held in your hand without burning yourself. The trade off for the action staying cool and clean is that you will experience snappier recoil when shooting which makes the piston rifle a little less accurate, especially for follow up shots. Finally, piston system parts are not interchangeable between manufacturers due to there being no set standard and the use of proprietary pistons and bolt carriers

I understand that you are keen to contribute to our article on fields. Now that your block for edit-warring has expired, you must decide how you want to progress this. I notice that while blocked you continued to edit the talk page with an IP. This is not permitted and I would be within policy and custom to reblock you for this, see WP:SOCK. I decline this time to do so, but I warn you not to repeat this or further measures will be taken against you. I hope this will not become necessary as you will not require to be blocked again. Do not edit war, see WP:EW, but discuss with your sources (see WP:IRS and WP:V) on the talk page, under your proper account. 

I know that editing here is a steep learning curve and I am willing to help you do it right. You must accept that we are a mature community with very well-established policies and customs. If you come here you have to work within that, just like if you get a job in a university you have to listen to the people who are already working there. I can tell you have a lot to offer to the project. Please make your arguments in talk, be patient and kind to the folks who wrote the article (I am not one but was asked to look at this by someone who is. This does not mean I endorse their opinion on how the article should read.) even (especially) when you disagree with their writing, and accept that you will seldom get all of what you want, just as in most areas of life. I am a volunteer just like you, but I have been around for a good while and I am entrusted with the janitorial role of making sure that things don't get damaged. In support of that role I am allowed to block users, protect articles from editing and certain other powers. I would very much rather not use them any further here. I am also a science graduate, and have some passing understanding of the subject you are here to edit, for whatever that may be worth.

Please resume your discussions in talk, but please do not edit-war or sock again. Let me know if you need any further help and I will be glad to offer it to you.   

My voice is important to me, if you take it upon yourself to snuff it out, or otherwise misrepresent it, in my book you are not out to help.

Ignoring you was not """"unwise"""", & I am hardly intimidated by your inadequate mastery of the rules you wish to nail to the wall. Perhaps you should review these dictates more closely yourself & check your double standards at the door. I am speaking of editing my criticisms of your actions amongst other things.

I did not start an """"edit war"""" as you imply. Your issue was personaldisobedience to be exact, with a sprinkling of that self empowering sparkle which lording over others endowsthe joy of duct tape & racquetball, which only a cop-at-heart can understand. I did not practice deception as you imply with the """"sock puppet"""", I signed my name to every puppets comment. I am not a perp, as implied by your actions in sum. Therefore you are barking up the wrong tree. I don't buy it that you are a robot bound to regs just doing your job as implied; you are a person making choices & you chose bad faith & laziness.

The generalisms you sincerely & patiently list, I'm sure are relevant in the wider context & larger community that you refer to & I'm sure what you do is of value there. I don't envy your job. In this case, however, we're talking two people debating in a forum, & an article that needs to be kept safe & sterile from any potential change lest something terrible happen! Is the cop/citizen ratio so mature in this community that there are resources to police such minor quibbles? Where am I Disneyland? Tracking IP's attached to names in order to reign in such terrorism is downright dumb for a supposedly progressive community. See WP WTF

If you place an obedient noob filter on any & every minor impulse-response test that passes though looking to improve upon the low grade blasphemy passing itself off for knowledge, you will reap what you sow. The page will never make it to the C grade it claims to be.

I do care about the subject, & *your* site is misrepresenting it for years now. I will continue to do what I can to fix it, with or without your rules if it's important to you that you stand in my way. There has been zero effort to address the fundamental criticism brought up a year ago now.

Laveol: Even last name Kolisev is a Macedonian one. Last names ending with """"ev"""", """"ov"""" are not Bulgarian. It happens that you have those in Bulgaria. But you have those last names in Macedonia, Russia, Check Republic, and so on.

Kolisev is a Macedonian last name. Same is Kolisevski. You can find both kinds with """"ov|ova"""", """"ev|eva"""", """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""" and others in Republic of Macedonia. So changing a last name from Kolisev to Kolisevski does not have any Bulgarian/AntiBulgarian implications. My last name is """"Janev"""". You can find in Macedonia also """"Janevski"""", """"Janeski"""". All of those are Macedonian last names. The fact that you can have """"Janev"""" in Bulgaria does not translate to ethnicity/origin claims in Macedonia.

Here are some last names that finish on """"ov"""", """"ev"""" and are not Bulgarian neither Macedonian:

[Sergei Lavrov]
[Anton Chekhov]
[Martina Navratilova]

So these last name endings are typical but not exclusive for some of the Slavic languages.
Same is with """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""", """"ich"""" which are shared between a number of Slavic languages.

To come back to Kolisevski: Kolisevski is a Macedonian last name, as well is Kolisev. If you can find a person living in Bulgaria with one of those last names, and probably you could not, does not gives any conclusion about ethnicity or being a Pro-Bulgarian.   """,0

Unfortunately, I don't know the literature on this field that well, just the general background. -) So I know how most of the techniques work, who some of the experts are on a couple of the topics, and I can point out if a particular source doesn't seem to understand the science. But I would say that it's too broad a topic (and not enough is known) for it to be covered in the scientific literature as a single unit. 

That said, these reviews might be useful - please let me know if I can explain anything for you. I've just added them to a couple of articles, so you may come across them in Wikipedia as well. -) I can also recommend more sources on any specific topics of interest. 

Gene therapy is the field that's furthest along. Related articles of interest include vectors in gene therapy (aka delivery methods) and genome editing. There are also techniques such as SCNT (where the entire nucleus is replaced - this is how Dolly was cloned), but I hesitate to consider those genetic engineering. 
Another field that comes to mind is regenerative medicine, although that article isn't nearly comprehensive. This (and the related field of tissue engineering) mainly focus on applications such as the growth of organs for transplant, starting from stem cells. However, it doesn't currently use much genetic engineering; the closest it gets is genetic reprogramming (I was extremely surprised to find that article didn't exist; I've just created it.)
As far as I'm aware, the use of genetic engineering to give humans new traits (as opposed to prevention or cures) is mostly speculative, although the techniques should apply in the same way. Synthetic biology is the closest (in that it attempts to devise new traits), but it's still just beginning and is extremely far from any application in humans. I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this (not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future), other than that which applies to human cells in culture.
The scope of the article is uncertain to me. Most of the sources that use """"human genetic engineering"""" as a viable description discuss ethics rather than science. (Of course, the ethics is important as well, but my familiarity is with the science.) There is a lot of scientific detail that can be discussed, but as I mentioned above, the science itself doesn't usually use such a broad categorization. 
The science is moving quickly. An article written in 2012 may have a significantly different background context from one written in 2011. 
Modification is easiest at the zygote or blastocyst stage. There is a bit of information on how this is done at transgenic mouse. (It's not done in humans, of course.)
There are a lot of people who use language such as """"the next stage in human evolution."""" (This is something I removed from the article.) I think I also saw it in a couple of respectable sources when I was editing this page, but it's at the least imprecise/poor wording and (at least in my opinion) should be attributed if included. It is valid under a broader definition where """"evolution"""" simply means """"change over time,"""" but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal-directedness (""""stages"""") - so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution, which doesn't have these properties.

Then Kurt Angle expanded it to include the SD Tag titles. Then HBK and HHH expanded it to include the WHC. So Tier 1 (WHC, WWE) Tier 2 (TT and SD TT) Tier 3 (IC not US) and Tier 4 (Euro). Then Kane expanded it to include HC on Tier 4. If anyone has any combination of those seven titles then they are a Grand Slam Champion. Even if tomorrow WWE.com were to announce the TCC and GSC never happened it would not change a thing. 
The point about Benoit is that WWE.com is not 100% reliable. They do change their minds (did the Rockers ever beat the Hart Foundation, no for about a decade then yes once Bret Hart left and they rewrote history). AT the moment the WWE do not acknowledge the existence of the 2004 RR winner, so does this mean we erase it from Benoit's article? No. The expanded definition for the GSC and TCC still stand, and as HBK never even wrestled for WWF/WWE while the HC title was active I have no idea why his bio would ever talk about the HC title.

populism as a positive term, and a critique of critics

Since I wrote last fall, several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred. The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, """"Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance"""" (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of """"populism"""" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of """"Enlightenment rationalism"""" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079

As far as Mike Huckabee's """"populism"""" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (""""Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee"""") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.  But, some German speaking editors could never accept this, and want this article to match the German Wikipedia article, Sudtirol.  Ever wonder why they constantly remove Alto Adige from bold face and any statement recognizing its use in English?  Anyway, I really hate to even participate in this nonsense anymore, but this move request is nothing less than abuse of Wikipedia (but, hey, what's new).  The same old editors are trying to come in here and flood the voting to change what was a decision made thru many weeks and months of discussions, and to a naming convention that is clearly biased towards a German point of view.

 For Safeties Sake 

The Violin Diary is a tragic romance novel by American author Eric M. Norcross.  
The novel chronicles the story of Ezzie, his obsession with a woman and the city in which he lives.  
The novel is told in the first person with a prose-like narrative and a seemingly honest attention to detail.

Summary

The story begins on New Years Eve, in Times Square, New York City.  
Ezzie introduces himself as a New York City transplant and talks a bit his feelings towards the city.  The story quickly progresses when
Ezzie meets Carmen, a Colombian national working in New York as she researches her options for attending art school.  The two quickly forge an awkward and often
intriguing relationship.  The tension thickens when Carmen ultimately decides to attend a school in Europe and possibly leave Ezzie in the city, alone once again. http://norcrossmedia.com/blog/category/the-violin-diary/

The publisher's description is actually an excerpt from a previously published review by Shane Pitkin Barden.  The excerpt of the review & description reads:

""""The Violin Diary relates two love affairs - one with a woman, one with New York. Both seem to mirror the author’s perception of The City, that “Life in New York always seemed to be moving back and forth, up and down - up and down, back and forth like violin notes; notes that are impressively changing and always dramatic.” Perhaps what is most memorable about this story are the thoughts Norcross poses and then ponders. And there are myriad statements that gave me pause when I read them; some because they are concise gems, others because they document simple gestures that hint of epic proportion when I tilted my perception ever so slightly. While The Violin Diary, on the surface, is a compilation of memories, it is really about one’s heart: where it starts, where it ends, and everything in between. It’s the journey - the everything in between - that matters most because it is what truly defines us."""" http://multi-mediareviews.blogspot.com/2008/10/violin-diary-by-eric-norcross-review-by.html

There is no need to threaten - I feel that we have been able to disagree very amicably up till now and are working well to come to a resolution which meets wikipedia's policies and procedures. I'm not putting WP:OR into an article, nor am I doing any. (Okay, I suppose calling it an urban legend was my own term and is WP:OR, but I was doing that conversationally and would never dream of putting it in the article). I simply said that this fact, if included, had to have a WP:RS. I have presented about a dozen or so sources, none of which include this. You have found one source, which is far less reliable than any of the ones I have brought, which mentions it as something rarely done today. I'm simply asking that this fact be sourced properly and that that be reflected in the article - something which you seem to be open to as well. If we use the BBC source, then we should probably also mention that none of the three major rabbinic organizations include this rule. (Citing their rules which I included links to in my previous comment). To clarify I'm not suggesting we use use the phrase """"urban legend"""" in the article at all - I'm just saying that we need a better source than the original one and that the scope of the source be reflected.
Frankly I understand your somewhat visceral reaction. This idea is so pervasive that it has almost become a reality in and of itself in that perception frequently affects reality. I was taught that it was true, and took it as fact until recently when I had a conversation with a rabbi who does conversions for the RCA and helped draft their policies. Only afterwards did I start digging and realized it had no source. It is impossible to prove a negative so I can't prove to you that it doesn't exist """"somewhere"""". However I can insist that we use a WP:RS. If you can find a reliable Jewish source, either classical or contemporary, for this then by all means include it with that source, but so far none has been located.   
As a side note here's another article on Marc Angel's group's website which would probably count as a RS - it's not in the description there either.   """,0

As you know, having replied there before, this matter is already being discussed here, two headings up.  Perhaps the two heading should be merged to prevent confusion.  I'd hate for someone to stumble on this """"Recent Karwynn deletions heading and, by no intention of your own, think that I deleted disputed material without discussing it on the talk page.  Either way, here's what I have to say about the matter.  I know it's long, but bear with me - you might find the rambling actually makes some sense.

Weasel Words
Your examples of improving weasel statements should be appreciated for what they are, but unfortunately, they don't really apply here.  The full process you linked to involved escalating from """"some say"""" to """"BUsh's critics"""" to """"Michael Moore"""" followed by accounts of a specific statement, namely, Moore's letter to Bush.  Here, that process has not been fully employed.  Unlike the specifically referenced Moore letter to Bush, which was direct and obvious in who it represented, these sources themselves still contain weasel words; take this sentence: A White House long accused of squelching internal dissent and ignoring outside viewpoints.  Accused by whom?  As I said before, just because weasel words are sourced, even directly quoted, doesn't make them ok.  n your example, the weasel words were eliminated by referencing the source of criticism directly.  """"Michael Moore said whatever"""".  In this case, we still haven't discovered who is doing all the accusing.  To say that the Washington Post is making the accusation is inaccurate.  To say that the Washington Post says that Bush has been """"long accused"""" is an accurate weasel statement, not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia.  It fails verifiability as well, come to think of it: the article certainly doesn't bother to support the sentence.  Read it for yourself.  They just throw it out there.  Verifiability doesn't mean """"you can find it somewhere else"""", it means """"It's been or can be verified to be true"""".  Perhaps it can be, but this article doesn't do it.  Do you see the difference between this case and the example provided in the WP:AWW guideline?  In the guideline's example, the weasel words were overcome by citing.  In this case, they still remain, because they are inherent in the source itself.

Citing the opinions of these articles
Well, this problem should speak for itself.  Opinions, including those of journalists, should not be cited as support for a claim.  It would be one thing if these criticisms were being mentioned to verify their existence (see Laura Ingraham, an article in which numerous criticisms are used to self-verify, but not used to support a claim within the article that Laura Ingraham is good or bad or this or that), as they are for many public figures, but they are being used as support for this """"particularly notable because"""" statement.  As I said before, which was ignored this... well, I'll just repost what I said before.
It's not a neutral article, nor is it a notably important surce. It's just another source. I could find an article that says something along the lines of """"Stephen Colbert proved that he is a manipulative, arrogant polemicist who cares nothing for social graces and only wishes to make a name for himself by being extreme and controversial"""", and if I stuck that sentence in the article's main body and referenced it, it would be (rightly) reverted before long. The same if I found an article saying that the accusations against Bush being intolerant of dissention were just a knee-jerk criticism and a political tool, lacking any merit. We shouldn't be able to throw political commentary into articles without restraint based on the premise that it's """"sourced"""". This entire statement contains non-neutral commentary about the performance; I don't care if it came from somewhere else, it's still not neutral to include it.
So here are my thoughts on this point, summed up.
Citing opinions is fine for verifying the existence of those opinions/criticisms, but not for supporting the Wikipedia article's opinionated claims (which, see above, shouldn't be in there in the first place).
This article is not notable to the subject matter.  It's very broad, compared to the narrowness of the article's subject (and, even narrower, it's notability and the cause of it).  The specific criticisms are not uncommon, and the article's themselves are not controversial.  They are not important enough to be set apart as evidence pertaining to the performance's notability and Bush's reputation.  Additionally, the source is more focuse",0

 The home page: I also removed this link because it does not contain information about the work and achievements that he is noted for, only links to his company and other Wiki-articles, including to his own entry.

Hope that explains why I did the edit - Cheers,",0

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

Seems to me we need a new vote…     18:48, 22",0

Photo Caption Correction
The photo containing a U.S. Army PSYOP humvee in Al Kut is incorrect. It is a 312th not the 350th PSYOP Company team (look at the left front of the vehicle for the identifier, the Marine article incorrectly identified the Army PSYOP vehicle). I know that particular vehicle in the photo and what a pain in the rear it was to maintain it.

Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong.

Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything.

I'd like to issue a public thank you to the Wikipedia community for their attention to this area.  This article has defiantly shown an improvement and is closer to scientifically accurate after my posts.  It is a big responsibility that Wikipedia has, and that responsibility should be free of cultural bias, even if it may seem to go against what we have been led to believe by American media and culture.

When I first started looking into this topic, the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased.  I still feel that objectively, the definition should clearly state that most cross-breeds lead to a reduction in fitness.  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as line-breeding but it is a wasteful effort.  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation, most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool.  99% of mutations are deleterious.

Respect of natural selection should be the default position.  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished, what makes us different is what makes us special.  By mixing the races, in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution.",0

 The Cramp Twins 

The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).

Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003.
Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year.
The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.

The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka """"Tokyo Mew Mew"""") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.

 Main characters 
 Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is """"Girlpants"""", but he sometimes calls Lucien a """"nerd"""". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. 
 Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo",0

"History of K.M.F. (Kill-Marry-Fuck):

The concept and game of K.M.F. was first commissioned by Courtney Porcella—resident of the City of Sin, Lynn, MA—in the early twenty first century in the United States of America, more specifically Massachusetts.  Spreading initially as “Kill-Marry-Fuck” between her and her close friends, this game quickly spread throughout the fourth floor of Donahue at Suffolk University, the school she currently attends.  Although this game quickly manifested itself into a game of pastime, it has never reached its full potential as an ice breaker due to the lingering question of its social acceptability.

Prior to the spring of 2010, K.M.F. was referred to as its founding name, “Kill-Marry-Fuck.”  The cause of the name change was brought on by a Senator from Suffolk University’s Student Government Association.  The main reason behind the move for the change was to reflect the professionalism of the student leaders occupying the offices on the fourth floor of Donahue.  Although K.M.F. was never targeted specifically, people got the message from the Senator and changed its name respectively.

Regardless of the name change, K.M.F. never lost it original essence, Donahue’s pastime.  And the name change now allows players to play K.M.F. in all types of atmosphere, ranging from weddings to preschool school.  Less than a year after the publicizing of K.M.F., this game has expanded to Boston’s neighboring cities.

At the time, Ms. Porcella has no disclosed plans to spread K.M.F. statewide or nationally.

Image use
Hello, concerning the pictures that have been deleted, I'd like to say that I support their inclusion here. They are not in any way sub-standard and for me they enhance the article. I am surprised by the claim that these were not agreed by other editors. Wiki publications encourage collaborative editing and nothing has to be agreed up front in this way.   

This image is clearly a photograph of another photograph, or poster, or leaflet.  Not only that, but its a badly framed snapshot, and is obviously the work of an amateur.  The image description is missing, and I do not believe that """"own work"""" is satisfactory for the source field given my concerns about the image.
MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.  of Doom 
I agree that that's a poor quality image and shouldn't be included in the article.   
Parrot, you still need to inform the image author on commons that you have nominated the image for deletion, also it would help the deletion debate if you could give any reasons for your suspicions.   

Regarding the other two images (right), the County Hall one seems reasonable enough, but the festival one is badly framed. The lens is too zoomed in for my liking.   

The 'Oss picture conveys the feeling of the festival to me, crowded, almost claustrophobic. Would be nice if the editors who originally objectd came here themselves to give their reasons.   
Note that there's also an alternative photo of the festival at File:Red obby oss party 20050502.jpg.   
Which doesn't include an 'Oss.   
No, and I sense that may be important.   

I still fail to see what's so terrible about these pictures. By the way, if you're going to remove pictures, please substitute better ones. That way the article is improved, rather than depleted. 

Going through them:
 The Cornish language one is maybe the worst of the lot, but the reflection on the image is clearly on the """"Rooms"""" banner, not on the photograph. It is difficult to find better images of Cornish language use on Wikimedia. Otherwise we're reduced to road signs which use Cornish place names - and they're really loans into English, rather than proper Cornish language use. Two other options to replace first image are on the right.
 There is no way to frame the """"Obby Oss"""". It takes place amongst large crowds of people, often on old streets. Other than that, I can't see what the big deal is here.
 The County Hall picture is fine as far as I'm concerned. (However, if you wish a better one, there may well be one on Geograph which can be transferred onto Wikimedia.) It's a non-partisan image, and can't be accused of pandering to any political tendency.

""""MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around."""" - If I wished to insult people, I'd use much stronger language! What I object to is the use of deliberately obscure (and dubious)  abbreviations to justify edits, without a decent explanation as to why. Personally I would have preferred some kind of reasoning. At least that seems to be happening just now.

Judaism has no special or particular view of Jesus, with very few texts in Judaism directly referring to or taking note of Jesus, and disputes all Christian interpretations of canonical Jewish scripture that allegedly make reference to him. does a decent jobs but the lack of text reference and disputing Christian interpretation are not really the most important things for an intro.

Childhood Section - NPOV?
I feel that the childhood section of this article is biased in favour of Phelps.  It is littered with unsourced statements that were obviously added by either Phelps himself or someone else who knows him well such as his family/cult members.  The information on how his mother used to play piano for the pleasure of the neighbours or how he played cornet in the school band but later switched to bass horn is completely unnecessary and colours the section to sound more like a memoir than a biography.  I think this section should be stripped down to include only relevant details about his early life to ensure that the article maintains a neural point-of-view.  

This article is becoming a joke

It's my opinion that Phelps is simply TOO controversial a subject on whom to do an exhaustive encyclopedic biography of a living person.  I believe that 99% of Wikipedians have their hearts in the right places, but I'm very dismayed at the constant changes in this piece.  Nobody knows for sure the motivations of Fred Phelps, yet everyone continues to guess at them.  This in turn makes the entire article riddled with POV.  I propose stripping this article down to the bare minimum.  When Phelps has passed on, historians will be more likely to ascertain his impact on world culture; specifically in the United States.  As it stands now, nobody knows whether he is a religious zealot, grandstander, nut-case, or any combination thereof.  But people keep on guessing, and I simply don't believe that makes for a very good encyclopedia article.  

Disagree with stripping this article down to bare minimum.  He is one of the most controversial figures around today and deserves more detailed coverage.   

Detailed coverage does not mean the same thing as posting opinions.  Documented information or peer-reviewed critique are the key to preventing POV. See Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view - 

 I have to agree with Alex. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news service or a celebrity gossip page. The article should be stripped down to basic facts which meet the standards of encyclopediac sources. This will make it easier to maintain a non point of view perspective. There are hundreds (at least) of other sites only a Google away which can provide juicier bits.  

Aging Fred
Would it be worth mentioning that most of the administration of the church has been taken over by Fred's daughter Shirley? In Louis Theroux's BBC2 documentary just screened, Fred did nothing but read out prewritten diatribe and seemed to have trouble answering how many children he had when asked. http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/noise/?id=louis_theroux  
Only if you can find a reliable source which says that Shirley has taken over day-to-day management of the church. If you have a source for that statement, go for it. '''''' (talk) 

Upon watching the documentary, I felt that Fred did not have trouble answering how many children he had, but was merely expressing irritation at the question, indicating that anyone who had done basic research would know not only how many children he had, but how many were still in regular contact with Fred. Whether that irritation was justified can only be answered by those who were present during Louis Theroux's stays in Topeka. John Warburton 
I think (OR/POV) Theroux was trying to establish whether Phelps counted the 4 dissenting children as his, and Phelps saw this and tried to avoid answering either way.  In any case, I don't consider that the documentary presented any credible evidence loss of faculties (though that doesn't mean that he's mentally stable). 08:42, 3 October""",0

 The best response is no response? 

It seems that every time i try to talk to anybody around here, things end up deleted or changed. Chronic problem. At least this time
it was actually apparently you who did it. Nice change.
Are you just going to delete and ignore the people who are trying to
get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems?

Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here. You don't have a creative or collaborative encyclopedia; You have a psycholigcal war
zone.

What are you going to do about it?
My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory,
Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense.
I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements.

LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational
service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your
problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.

Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are.

It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress
the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal
is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas.

Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama.
People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them
for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is.

Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry
and to the point message you failed to answer.

Wikipedia IS evil

It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in """"neutral"""" language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this """"Randian"""" Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors.

 TIBIN VARGHESE (CREATED BY) Hypertension  

Hypertension
 
Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the """"top"""" number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the """"bottom"""" number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.

Effect on the Eyes
High blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathy
Hypertensive retinopathy
 
Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur.
Bone Loss
Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women.

Sexual Dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction.
Pregnancy and Preeclampsia
Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles.
This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it.

The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child.
Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring.
Uterine Fibroids
High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%.

Outlook for Children with Hypertension
Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor",0

"Medvedev's advisers 

I thought Medvedev would stop short of recognizing after yesterday's political show in the two chamber Federation assembly. But he didn't. The decision seems amazingly ill prepared and leaves Medvedev with a legacy he'd probably better be without. So my qestion is: Does Medvedev rely on exactly the same team of advisers as Putin did? Or did Putin de facto take with him the foreign policy to the Moscow White House? Is this the first hint of the expected power struggle between Putin and Medvedev - or is Medvedev just a puppet, temporary in charge till Putin can regain the office of President of Russia? 217.21.232.237",0

Fine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term """"Roman Catholic Chruch""""- only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are.  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .  The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church, and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV, then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible.
I was aware that """"Catholic"""" also means universal and is a Mark of the Church- I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word """"Catholic"""" in their names.  It is for this reason alone that perhaps there is no really satisfactory way to resolve this issue, and perhaps it is truly best to incorrectly use the term """"Roman Catholic Church"""" to refer to the entire church that is in communion with the Vatican.

"""[outdent]David,  I have tried in the nicest possible way to tell you that the majority of the text you are so set on using is not suitable as an encyclopaedia article. Copyvio or no, anything that builds up to soliciting money and indeed actually explicitly  requests  donations going so far as to give the bank details is not going to last five minutes. If all the time an effort you have expended trying to get the copyvio undeleted had instead been spent pulling together a new article it would all be done and dusted by now. I repeat my previous advice: base an article on Sport England. 

I'm also not sure whether you have been following the conversation on George's talk if not you might consider hopping over there as my question has been answered and it has been confirmed that as far as Wikipedia is concerned the text is still not released to GFDL. You'll also notice that your conflict of interest has been raised as a concern; personally I think that it is manageable, although Wikipedia does generally discourage people from editing on subjects they are personally connected with as we recognise that this does make it hard to remain neutral. The general rule of thumb is that if a topic is notable enough for inclusion then likely an uninvolved editor will be along soon enough to create an article about it. 

On the question of the image. I presume from looking at your talk page that you are referring to the (separately deleted) logo. This is entirely separate from the article and from reading what George says I understand that you have released it under GFDL. I would first ask you to think again very carefully about the implications of this as usually logos remain copyrighted and are used under a strict fair-use rationale. It is rarer than hens teeth that any organisation would relinquish their rights to their own logo/identity and release it for others to do with what they wish - are you confident for example that your board properly understand what this means and are entirely comfortable with it? However, if this really is the case then all you need to do is upload it (by clicking """"Upload file"""" on the menu on the left) making sure that you attribute the correct licensing and source information - the upload page will walk you through this. 

Finally on a housekeeping note could I ask that you not start a new thread every time you post here on this subject. You'll see that I have been moving your posts up under the one heading to keep the conversation together. Cheers,  talk

Arbitration enforcement action appeal by WookieInHeat

Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found in this 2010 ArbCom motion. According to that motion, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

 Appealing user   –   

 Sanction being appealed  - Blocked for 48 hours for: """"Personal attacks or harassment: NPA and ARBPIA violation - accused editor of supporting terrorism"""" - Discussion of sanctions at WP:AE

 Administrator imposing the sanction  

 Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.

Statement by WookieInHeat

Georgewilliamherbert's reason for blocking me relied solely upon the idea that i personally attacked Nableezy by accusing him of """"supporting terrorism"""". from an absolutist POV, nowhere in any edit was the word """"terrorism"""" even mentioned. my observation that nableezy's political POV on wikipedia aligns with the political goals of hamas was by no means meant as a personal attack, nor to insinuate the more abstract idea of nableezy's support for terrorism. my primary intention was to highlight nableezy's possible WP:COI with the subject while he was pushing to have negative information about it removed. my main point here is that i find george's reasoning for my block to have been rather arbitrary and ambiguous.also, the duration of the blocks handed out seems somewhat irrational. nableezy, a user with a lengthy history of often thinly veiled and sometimes outright personal attacks not to mention numerous complaints about their civility, was given only a token block of three hours for a direct personal attack . whereas i have no significant or pertinent history of incivility and was blocked for 16 times that length (48 hours) for what some have misconstrued as a personal attack based on the wholly fabricated idea that i called someone a """"terrorism supporter"""". not to mention nableezy plainly knew that his blatant personal attack would result in a ban, where i went to some length to clarify that my comment was not a personal attack. also, i did not respond when nableezy attacked me directly, and i was the first user to drop the argument and bring the discussion back to the topic at hand .i really cannot stress enought the fact that i never accused nableezy of """"supporting terrorism"""", not only did i never directly say this, it was never even implied by my comments. thus it would seem my block was based entirely on a misconception of what was meant when i said """"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association hamas""""  implying this was actually instead intended to say """"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association terrorism"""". this is simply not the case, and frankly i am somewhat offended myself at george's insinuation that i would arbitrarily class",0

Good Article review
Using the ever-changing meme catch phrases of the internet, this article is full of win! In other words, I find this article to be richly deserving to GA status, due to its high quality. There can, of course, be some improvements, but nothing that I think represents real failures of the Good Article criteria. The article is neutral almost everywhere, I see no sign of real instability, it seems to fulfill the specific MoS guidelines of the GA criteria nicely, there don't seem to be any obvious gaps in the article's coverage, the referencing is top quality, and the images all seem to be ok. I also have a few comments on more minor things that should help improve this article even further.
You mention """"Conservative clergy"""" as people who opposed the bank, but even though that is exactly the phrase the reference uses, i'm not so sure that's actually what the Islamic equivalent of clergy is called. Might want to look into that. 
The paragraph about the Global Elders seems like it doesn't belong, because it looks less neutral than the rest of the article. """"convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity together to the world."""" is entirely subjective and this line is not referenced, I presume this was meant as a direct quote of some statement they made, that should be referenced and the sentence should be framed in a way that makes it clear that it was from a statement, rather than a statement of fact according to Wikipedia alone. 
It looks like the paragraph has more to do with the Global Elders rather than Yunus. It should focus on that Yunus is a member, rather than talk about who is funding the Global Elders and who is the chair and all those details not directly relevant to Yunus. 
In the family section, """"His younger brother Muhammad Jahangir is a popular television presenter."""" doesn't seem to be referenced.

b. 1915, d. 1987. Age: 72 (Stroke) 
Overview 
Herb Miller, Glenn Miller's younger brother, was born in North Platte, Nebraska, and, like Glenn, studied music in High School. Herb worked his way through college by playing the trumpet. He spent a short spell working in his brother's band, doubling as trumpeter and also as business manager. Herb then accepted an offer to play trumpet with Charlie Spivak. Herb did have a band of his own in the early 1940s. In 1943, he and his band appeared in a movie called """"Spotlight Scandals,"""" starring Harry Langdon (about a year before he died), and featuring singer Bonnie Baker. William Beaudine was the director. Late in the 1950s, Herb formed his band and toured the U.S. with appearances in hotels and ballrooms, including the Aragon Ballroom in Ocean Park, CA, the Jerry Jones Ballroom, and the Rendezvous Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT. Yet, despite Herb's best efforts, the band only met with moderate success. The only album cut by the band, in America, was on Herb's own label, Millertone. While Herb's band never came even remotely close to the fame that his older brother Glenn achieved, it is still active and quite popular in England today (1999). After WWII, Herb settled in Pacific Grove, California, and made that his home base for about 25 years. 

Mr. John Lovejoy, a former student of Herb's and onetime member of his band, recalls: 
""""Herb didn't form his band while his brother was alive, and not until many years after his brother's death. He was so devastated by his brother's disappearance that he got out of the commercial music business and moved to Pacific Grove, where he got a job as an elementary and junior high school music teacher in the Pacific Grove Unified School District. 

""""I first met Herb when I was in fourth grade and became a beginning trumpet student of his. Herb's son, John, ( -John Arthur Miller, who today still leads the Herb Miller Orchestra in England), was my best friend in grammar school. Herb was a very talented music teacher, gruff but fair, and the kids all loved him. He also was the leader of the Monterey Civic Band, to which most of us Herb Miller Orchestra members belonged. (NB: Mr Lovejoy has advised that circa 2002, the orchestra was re-named the """"John Miller Orchestra"""".) 

""""Herb, for some reason, decided in the late 1950s to form his own band, and his own children were a part of it. John (known as 'Jackson') played bass and sang; Mary Luann, his eldest daughter, who went by 'Luann', also sang and played piano; Richard 'Richie' Miller, his younger son, played trumpet; and Janet, or 'Jannie,' his youngest child, sang. His wife, Ann, was band manager. Some of the rest of us were his former students who were still in high school or had recently graduated; other members were area teachers. One of his trumpet players, Tony Venza (whose playing sounded like Harry James), drove a moving van for a living. 

""""Initially, Herb was quite ambivalent about using his brother's fame to boost his own image. He actually used to claim that his band and Glenn's were not at all alike. But, in fact, they were almost identical. Herb looked and talked like Glenn ('And now, something a little old, new, borrowed and blue...'), although he was shorter in stature. He played Glenn's most famous songs, and his own arrangements sounded just like Glenn's. The only difference was that he used only two trombones instead of four, as Glenn did. 

""""The first record Herb made was called 'First Steps Of A New Miller' on the Millertone label. It was a failure, of course, since he paid for it out of his own pocket, and distribution was limited. And, of course, even in the 1950s-'60s, his music was dated. He thought it was because of rock and roll, which he fervently believed was a communist plot. He reasoned that the communists introduced rock and roll into American culture in order to put 'legitimate' musicians out of work and thereby ruin the American economy. 

""""Herb had a few other idiosyncrasies, too. For instance, when people found out he was Glenn's brother, they would inevitably mention Glenn's death. Herb would explode, 'Glenn's not dead! Don't ever say that again!' Later, a few years after he'd started his own band, he seemed to have accepted his brother's death. That's when he started drinking and when he started trading on his brother's name. 

""""After moving to England, he really went overboard on comparing himself to Glenn. He even had a poster made up with him posing exactly like the famous picture of Glenn, holding a trombone and looking over his shoulder. This was kind of strange because Herb's main instrument was the trumpet. 

""""Herb was one of the most intense and driven people I've ever known. And, he was",0
"Don't really see why it matters. He obviously did it, and it won't affect how long he is locked up for anyway, given the other lulz he has been convicted of previously. Tbh, it would just be quite funny to have a full article on him, despite the ongoing trial. I don't really see how he did anything wrong myself, he just seems like the type with a fantastic sense of humour. 195.248.122.97",0

 MSM 

Agreed

Every single source I have and Puellanivis has referred to has said that TG/TS women are considered MSM or """"along side"""" MSM. The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.

The rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   

No, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they """"biological"""" sex.  However, again, if a TS/TG were reported as female, since no gender identity information would be collected there would be no indication of which were which.  Literally TS/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS/TG are recorded as MSM.  The answer is """"it's inconsistent and no one knows"""", not """"haha I'm right, you're wrong, TS/TG are always MSM"""".   """,0
"""Blacks have extremely low visual memory so it is very difficult for them to recall digits in reverse.

Race and intelligence (explanations)#Spearman's hypothesis

IQ tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties. Individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents. The mean Black-White difference varies considerably across tests with different contents. For example, the BW gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order. Across a large number of test, the standardized mean Black-White gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation. According to , """"this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean W-B difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests.""""

""""The g-based factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities"""" Correlations between an IQ subtest's g-loading, and the magnitude of the Black-White-East Asian score gap for that subtest (;  pp. 47-8;  pp. 138-9).  For example, the Black-White gap is greater on backward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test) than forward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given, and the less g-loaded test).  As predicted by Spearman's hypothesis, the B-W gap is largest on the most g-loaded tests.  Narrowing of the B-W gap has been seen mostly on less g-loaded tests, such as literacy tests. Murray, C.  (2005) """"The Inequality Taboo"""".  Commentary Magazine, September 2005. Arthur Jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the Black-White gap (for example, """"past history of slavery"""", discrimination, """"caste status"""", """"peer pressure against 'acting white'"""", etc) have an effect on g (, p. 510).
|The author of multiple factor analysis, L. L. Thurstone (1947), warned """"we must guard against the simple, but common, error of merely taking a first centroid factor, a first principal component, or other mean factor, in a test battery and then calling it a general factor"""".  """"Spearman's g, then, is a """"statistical artifact."""" (C. Loring Brace, 2001)

The gap is larger to recall digits in reverse because blacks are much lower in visual intelligence.

""""a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test""""

IQ tests are biased against blacks because they are designed to test people with high visualspatial intelligence.

This is obviously original research, but I cannot find no sources that supports my argument (even though I am not black).

Peacock words

WP:PEACOCK lays it out pretty clearly, and specifically mentions """"famous"""" as a word to avoid.  But people seem to wish to use this word, in one particular place only, in this article.  The logic behind avoiding the word is very clear: it's subjective, and described what people might think about something rather than any objective fact about it.  What is """"famous"""" to you is not """"famous"""" to me, and vice versa.  So either we liberally add the word throughout every article, to describe anything that could be considered by anyone to be """"famous"""", or we don't use it at all, unless it was used in a quote or other trivial exceptions.

The only """"major controversy"""" is that on this Wikipedia page, the denialists, such as Duesberg and his followers, those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page, and who have had their long-disputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years, were being used as the sole source of 'credible' information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it.  From the first edit I made, I was almost immeditely reversed, and edited.  Within hours of that first contribution, I was being threatened and censored.  Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

 Spastic Cerebral Palsy 

 Discovery 
Cerebral Palsy was first discovered, and medically defined in 1861 by Dr. William John Little. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/. 

Little attributed the disease to a lack of oxygen to an infant during """"abnormal forms of labor"""" resulting in a spastic condition. His work on the disease was so groundbreaking that it was first known as Little's Disease. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/.

 Definition 
Cerebral palsy is a disease that effects the brain and nervous system. The disease can be divided into various subsets, including spastic cerebral palsy, dyskinetic cerebral palsy, ataxic cerebral palsy, hypotonic cerebral palsy, and mixed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/

Spastic Cerebral Palsy is the most common form of this disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/. It is distinguishable from other forms of Cerebral Palsy in that sufferers display stiff, jerky movements, and have hypertonic muscles. http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/spastic%20cerebral%20palsy This differs from Non-Spastic cerebral palsy, which causes decreased, or fluctuating muscle tone. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/types/#cm

Spastic Cerebral Palsy can itself be divided into unique categories.
 Spastic hemipelegia
Only one side of the body is effected in spastic hemipelgia. 
Spastic dipelgia
2 limbs are effected in Spastic dipelgia. 
Spastic triplegia
3 limbs are effected in Spastic diplegia.
Spastic quadripelgia
All 4 limbs are effected in Spastic quadriplegia.

First, NPOV is only violated by you. Why do you say """"of course"""" (as EU brings nothing good) and if you look e.g. to England or Poland, most parties are Anti-EU (which does not mean, they want immediately a withdrawal), and that's """"of course"""". It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations. But as you say, you don't want they have weight, because you simply do not tolerate other opinions about the EU and wanna have your LibDem-Pro-EU-Opinion (which is anyway evil) in the article and undermine the parties who want real freedom and independence (though in fact, we Anti-EUists do not have opinions, but knowledge). Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform. But you may be right with the fact, that the party-lists are already better explained in the article Euroscepticism (while """"Euroscepticism"""" is also rather a pro-EU valuating name, better would be """"Eurocriticism"""" or """"Anti-EUism"""") which would but not be a reason to delete the lists, but to delete this whole article and simply redirect to Euroscepticism and transfer the other information.

 """"Delhi tops the list in crimes among all states of India, followed by Maharashtra""""
 You haven't read the article you linked to. Quote from the article: """"UP accounted for the highest 33.9% of the total crime reported in India last year followed by Andhra Pradesh (13.9%) and TN (11.4%).""""
 It does say that as a city, Delhi, followed by Mumbai, tops the crime list among the """"mega cities"""". Like I said - such a statistic is meaningless unless you consider per capita. Please read my comment again.
 You cannot say that """"Tamil Nadu is more crime-oriented than Goa because TN is #3 on the list, far ahead of Goa."""" If the population of Goa is 10 times less than that of TN, it won't be surprising if 1000 cases were reported in TN as opposed to only 100 in Goa. Delhi and Mumbai are the most populous cities in India, so it's not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities.
 Another example: India's GDP is higher than that of Australia, Canada, Singapore and several other countries  that doesn't mean that India is the among the richest countries in the world. The per capita figures are the true indicator.

 """"If so then even London is capital of UK does it mean crimes in London could be ignored?""""
 That's a straw man argument. Who said anything about crimes being ignored?  The demographics section of the article on Delhi already mentions that """"Delhi accounted for the highest percentage (16.2%) of the crimes reported in 35 Indian cities with populations of one million or more"""" and """"Delhi accounts for 15.4% of crime against women in Indian cities.""""

Indian martial arts
The dispute is that I've mentioned the official citations from Tsumi Hozan jujutsu, the Shaolin Temple, Gracie family and Goju Ryu Karate and what I keep getting is that Japan and China never interacted with any ancient civilization at all and the official citations don't mean anything, the facts when backed by the official citations will get an NPOV and Factual Inaccuracy tag and as if that was not enough I've been called anti- white people, pro tamil (I really have no idea when I came to be identified as a Tamil, I'm not anything even remotely close), Alex Doss (one of the guys believes that I actually am that guy) and biased, my credibilty now becoming a questionable thing, my sources are undisputed. 

I've cried myself hoarse for anyone to come dispute the official sources on the talk pages and no one comes forward to , they go mad because I mentioned a fighter from a game in the Indian martial arts in pop culture section and when they fraudeulently changed his fighting style from what CAPCOM officialy states, I objected.

I started the article, I've been sincerely working my ass off, the first few times I even edited the article so any legitimate grievances will be met.
Plus, I've constantly maintained that In addition to what I've officially cited here, I'll bring forward an assortment of websites confirming my facts and a huge list of academies and official citations from martial arts disciplines in near future but none of that stops the opposition from mindlessly putting the tags in there.

In other words, the information is undisputed, the official sources been mentioned and they confirm my stand, the opposition though, has adopted a technique of three-on-one encircling, deviation from the central topic of official citations (on which I have yet to hear why do they think that official citations are NPOV and Factually IC material) and mindless lies (like changing the fighting style of video game charecter Dhalsim) and have gone to the extent of telling me to """"be a nice chap"""" and more things to that effect. 

I've cited the official sources and that's it, if someone has a problem with the official versions they'll have to live with the fact that the problem  exists in their head and not in the article, the shaolin knows more about it's history than any of the three involved, it's a fact.

=====

The Wikipedia article on Federal Vision shows a strong flavor of bias, because it does not clearly describe Federal Vision's distinctive, and often contested, meanings for various Christian theological words and phrases of long standing; and because it omits an adequately clear summary of the most common criticisms of FV.

The neutrality of the article can be strengthened in at least two ways. One way is clarify the new definitions that certain Federal Visionists have created for certain established theological terms and phrases. For example, the Federal Vision's view of """"covenant objectivity"""" results in a category of person some have called the """"unbelieving Christian"""" or """"unsaved Christian"""", which most evangelicals regard as an oxymoronic statement. 

Federal Visionists assert a belief in election, but subdivide the elect between elect who are granted an additional grace of perseverance and thus persevere in their faith unto eternal life, as opposed to a different category of the elect who are not granted a special grace of perseverance by God, and as a result apostasize from the Christian faith and are eternally condemned to hell. 

The phrase """"obedient faith"""" has been adopted from controversial CRC pastor Rev. Norman Shepherd, and is used to signify that one is justified not by faith alone (that is, faith in Jesus Christ and the Gospel, considered apart from its subjective ethical influences), but by the consequent actions of ethical obedience to God's will which result from faith.

This brings us to a second way to make the Wikipedia article neutral, which is to add a clear section on basic criticisms of Federal Vision. 

The link section addresses some of these, but there ought to be material in the body of the article itself that enumerates and clearly describes the most common criticisms of Federal Vision. E.g., Federal Vision has been criticized as not being properly described as """"evangelical"""" (since """"evangelical"""" denotes a Protestant insistence on the necessity of individual conversion), in light of its teaching of presumptive baptismal regeneration, and continual criticism (and sometimes mockery) of American evangelicalism's emphasis on the encessity of conversion. In this sense, it appears to be more akin to high Anglicanism, which is non-evangelical. The claim that it more faithfully represents the thought of John Calvin is disputed by many familiar with Calvin's theology.

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

Langston Hughes
Hi Bobcat, I saw that you have submitted Langston Hughes for GA review. Having been involved in some of the GA process I have to say, I don't think LH is ready for this, for various reasons. There is not one major editor looking after or improving the page and hasn't been for many years. This means there's nobody involved who's ready and set to do all the work to bring it up to GA standard. Much of it has no citation, which is a must for a GA. There is no section about the themes and/or style of his work, critical appraisal and such, which is also needed. I appreciate it's a vote of confidence in the article, which is great, but I know that there is a long GA appraisal backlog and it's a pretty time consuming process for reviewers. (There's work waiting since January to be reviewed). Maybe have a look at poet's articles such as W. B. Yeats, Maya Angelou and Walt Whitman to get a sense of what's needed. Editors often submit articles for a peer review first, to get a general sense of where the article is at and what works needs doing, before applying for the whole GA/FA hog. So, I'd personally recommend withdrawing the application for GA and maybe work on some of the article points until the basics are in place. Thanks and best wishes   """,0

Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article.

"What a hypocrite this creep Chavez is!

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1

The assertion that that the /rr/ in """"carro"""" is normally pronounced as h, x or χ is simply wrong. To the extent that such pronunciations exist at all, they are restricted to certain regions and, by and large, to uneducated speakers, and thus fall far short of being considered standard. As a matter of fact, they sound rather odd to most native speakers and would hardly ever be encountered in the media. Without conducting a scientific survey, I would say that x and χ for initial /r/ and intervocalic /rr/ are restricted to poorly educated speakers from the city of Rio de Janeiro and its surroundings, while the media and all reasonably educated speakers there are actually notorious for their use of [ʁ].

Creationism is the explanation  that the universe and all life were created by the deliberate act of God.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.

If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. 

Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. 

From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - 16:08, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Considering that """"Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term """"belief"""" was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed """"evolutionist bias"""" you claim is on the Creationism page.  16:48, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

"direct line joins the west coastway line  
The image is too low res to be able to see any trace of a station. I still want to see some reference. That is some document, preferably on the web, that indicates that this station ever existed.   
 the station has been closed for over 60 years there is no trace of the station left except a ballast house.   (Originally posted to User talk:RHaworth.)
What is a ballast house? How many times do I have to tell you? Solid evidence please.   
 a ballast house is where they keep the stones placed under tracks. they are now used for track marshalls when they are working on the track - hence they now have windows. there are plenty of them around and like i said there is one where denvilles station was.  
 on the picture you can see a clearing where the station building and platform foundations still exist. some of them blue bricks are still around. the blue bricks were common on the also disused section of the metropolitan line near amersham so it could have been designed by the same architech  
What picture? I am getting a bit fed up of being told what you can see on the ground. Just find me three articles on the web that mention this station. (You name me any other closed English railway station and I will give you half a dozen links to it.)   

This station does not exist according to a Railatlas (OPC 10th edition) and Quail (latest Southern Region edition). Quail lists ALL old stations. I ride the line frequently and there is nothing of interest in the marked area.  

 Possible signal boxes 

Are there any level crossings in Denvilles needing a signal box to interlock it.  All things considered, under the Block Telegraph system of safeworking, such a box would allow a train to advance closer to the junction at Havant from the previous station at Rowlands Castle railway station, which is quite a long way away.

 

Additional information
Denvilles railway station existed between 1858 and 1859 only, though there are remains there to this day.  That might explain the paucity of sources on the internet, though I've found one and added it..

"Choose your Loyalties 

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

A proud AMERICAN",1

"Thank you for your kind offer Reinyday. I accept. Admittedly I am very new to Wikipedia and am learning as I go. In my opinion, this will eventually become the most comprehensive and definitive Sweetest Day article anywhere. Contrary to what many may think, I am not anti-Sweetest Day. I simply believe Americans have a right to know the real history of what they are celebrating when it comes to holidays. The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost? America pays the cost of Sweetest Day in credibility, a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again. 

Please allow all images to remain in the article (unless they do not comply with Wikipedia standards). More will be uploaded soon!

"I am really writing this post to counter the claims that Marxism has direct responsibility for human rights violations, or the regimes it has inspired, (although admittedly at the end of the day Marxism may hold some indirect reponsibility). I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalists, it was backwards, and most of its populace was uneducated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral/ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communists the reasons were nationalistic or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right. What I am saying is that if Marx dictated that communist states should function as they have and do today, yes maybe human rights violations would deserve a mention, but his ideology is not to blame, it is the [people who follow his ideology who often commit the crimes.86.150.147.133   User: R.G.P.A",0

 Why Two Pages? 

Now, I'm not an """"authority"""" such as people here claim to be. I don't hold any PhDs, nor do I feel I posses a """"body of knowledge"""" that """"is very likely to dismiss...innocent guesses, or fractal knowledge.""""  I have, however, spent some time in Russia and in Kazakhstan, specifically Almaty. That is the name I always hear people use - Almaty. The Russians, however, still call it Alma-Ata. For example, I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile, and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty. All the people I met in Almaty, however, say Almaty. When I see the name written on signs and billboards in the city, it is also written as """"Алматы"""" (Almaty). 

From my experience, only the Russians continue the use of Alma-Ata. As another example, the train station in Moscow says Алма-Ата (Alma-Ata). However, it also says Gorki instead of Nizhny Novgorod (most everyone there says Nizhny Novgorod, or """"Nizhny"""" for short - I can't recall actually hearing """"Gorki"""" used beyond the train station).

Also, It's not just the Kazakh government who uses that name - it's a lot of people. Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty (they sometimes mention """"the Soviet Alma-Ata"""", much like Bishkek is the """"Soviet Frunze"""". 

As for using the scientific/scholarly-approved approach for naming, Wikipedia doesn't do that (as mentioned above). See, the """"scientific"""" or """"academic"""" method for writing the offical name of the country - Қазақстан - is actually Qazaqstan (the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English). There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a """"K""""  - including Wikipedia. If people say we should use """"Alma-Ata"""" because it's the correct name as dictated by academics, why no Qazaqstan?  

Anyway, my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles (Almaty and Alma-Ata). I think there should only be one, since regardless of the name it is still the same place. All the pictures and information should be seen together, on one page. They should be merged. 

Oh, one more thing. I just went to Google and looked up """"Алматы"""" (Almaty) - 4,270,000 hits. I then looked up """"Алма–Ата"""" (Alma-Ata) - only 1,160,000.""",0

"Trevithj:   The reason sources discussing the negative feedback amplifier do not mention set-points, errors, and comparators is that they have no more relevance than the stock market.

They are understandable as he intended them- the use  of feedback bypasses  the  inadequacies of the nonlinear, variable, and uncontrollable properties of the large-gain open loop amplifier, as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closed-loop gain to be set at 1/β, as fixed by a resistor divider, for example, by making the closed-loop gain 'independent entirely'' of the open-loop gain.

 Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind 

Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. 

My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: """"Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."""" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section.   """,0

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """,0

Comments from an EVDL member
I'm forwarding these comments from an EVDL member:
 In the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:WPEVStartRun.png image, the relay is called Ry RL, but down in the text it's referred to as Ry RS.

 Just a question:  in the first part of the article, it talks about how the car should operate like an ICE vehicle, requiring the key to be turned to the Start position.  But then later in the article, it talks about breaking people of the habit of the pressing the accelerator pedal.  Maybe I'm one of those operators of older vehicles talked about, but I still press the accelerator when I start my car, whether it's fuel-injected or not.  So it seems like in the same description, it's trying to make the car start like an ICE vehicle, and yet not make it start like an ICE vehicle.

 The rectangular area called In Cab confused me.  At first, I thought it was some special kind of component.  Then I came to think that, no, it's not a component at all; it just represents """"somewhere inside the cab.""""  I think this latter view is the correct one, but I'd like text and/or picture to make it clearer.  I'm also not sure what the short blue wire between """"Run Buss"""" and """"Run:"""" is for.  My guess is that it's for other systems that are activated only when the ignition state has been latched, but the text doesn't make that clearand this also added to my confusion about the In Cab being a component.

 I don't know what this means:  """"The run buss is grounded when not in the run state, allowing additional interlocks to be included in order to ensure proper shutdown.""""   Where would these additional interlock be placed?  How would they ensure proper shutdown? 

 Finally, I had to think about diode D1.  When the key switch is in the Start position and both relays are enabled, there will be 12V on each side of the diode.  Therefore the diode won't conduct, since one side isn't lower in voltage than the other.  When the key switch is then returned to the On position, the Alarm-Start Relay will open, removing the +12V on the negative side of the diode, so the diode will start conducting, thus keeping the Latch Relay energized.  Is that correct?  If so, maybe an explanation could be added to that effect for dummies like me.  If not, then perhaps add a description of the way it really works.

Thanks for your good work here (That's for YOU, not me).  Hope this helps. - Bill Dennis  """,0

If you suggest something you have to accpet the logic behind.

Therefore they should be treated in the Algerian page as Tindouf is in Algeria.

If you do not accept this, then you have to drop the narrow focusing on the geogrpahic limits and start admitting that the crimes committed by polisario are done in relation to Western Sahara and therefore can be extended in this article.

It's been a frustrating set of compromises, believe me. I've had people that wanted me to use the website name as the work field, and others that thought it the website was a publisher. I still believe that the organization that issues the chart in the first place should be treated as the author, and I finally removed that field from the citation because there was a very loud campaign from people that just couldn't understand that corporations can legally be treated as people. Use of italics was another set of arguments, and there was a large segment of people that believed that the chart names themselves were things that we could rewrite to suit our tastes.

Agreed.  That area of the table needs some work, and is not fully consistent on the distinction.  It came about because """"scheduled"""" (which was formerly the word used in all future launches) was both clearly incorrect and also unsourced for many of the rows in the table.  

When I looked at a bunch of the sources about a month ago (2015-02-14), for most of the far future launches, the most one could say is that they were """"under contract""""; while some of the very near term future launches (one to three ahead in the queue) were both clearly """"scheduled"""" and also scheduled with the particular local and national authorities to make the near term date have some meaning.

 Examples of errors in this version 

These are examples, not a comprehensive list. While typing it I had the very off-putting feeling that I had already done this several times, evidenced here. It hasn't worked with you, you're still unreasaonble, but I do it anyway for emphasis, and for the benefit of others. 

 """"The term """"Arabic numerals"""" is actually a misnomer""""
 This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). 

 """"... what are known in English as """"Arabic numerals"""" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."""", """"In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.""""
 What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.

 """"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.""""
 Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, """"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876"""" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science """"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD"""". According to Menninger (p. 400): """"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land """"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden."""" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression """"50 wreaths of flowers"""" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity."""" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, """"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."""" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.

If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups. National heros, prophets, Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them. Besides, you are by no means an expert on these issues. About your alleged ethnicity, it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd, Iranian or Russian. You need to revise your views. If you were persian, you would need an even more extensive revision. This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint.

 M1

N0 never produces an output. The algorithm always produces a “M1” result when the answer is “Yes” from the oracle queried, and never produces a result when the answer is “N0” even to the other possible phrasings of the same query. It is striking how easy it is to miss the ingenuity of our programmers here. Most of the solution was already present as much as the pioneers and experts in the field surmised and asserted possible. Particularly, the comment on Fermat’s Last Theorem is relevantly applicable, such deep theories are in many instances required to solve largely thought unsolvable problems, especially in cases when most of the solution and the proof in the word was already known to the experts in the field.

The algorithm answers “Yes” with “M1” when the output produced from a correctly asked question produces never a “No” (written as N0) result, but only a “Yes” result. Incorrectly stated questions are they that cannot be resolved because they result in a “N” or “No” output never producing m by the computer given an incorrectly asked question. Given a correctly asked question, the computer will always return a “M” output eventually. But given the complexity of the question and the known variables the time required to solve an NP-Complete problem depends entirely on the specific incidence and construction of this algorithm. To illustrate the functions here is a clear example:

Question correctly asked: “Does the remote control not need new batteries?”

ALGORITHM says check the button function, if it changes the channel on the TV or the volume of the TV the computer monitoring the remote control produces a “M” result. The conclusion is output: Yes means no.

Incorrectly asked question seeking an NP-Complete problem: “Does the remote control have new batteries?” 

If the check of the remote control does reveal a failure of the button to change the channel or volume of the TV the answer is the conclusion is never output because this would be a “No” or “N” response.50.20.186.81  I Jesus, leave it as a proof to all life.

I agree with you that extremely low speed limits rigidly enforced by camera is the best way of doing this, and I also agree with you that the rise in deaths caused in the short term by these measures is nothing compared to the millions of lives which will be saved when private motoring has been restricted to the most important people (like you and me).

 Demonising Turks 

It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too. It seems that all that it needs to get the Jew and the gentile on the same wagon, is to beat the tired old donkey issue of the barbarious Turk.

It wears thin.

To be honest, I don't want Turkey to join the EU. I want you and teh editors and admin that are like-minded to carry on with your actions. We need to perpetuate the misnomers and misrepresentation of the Turks. Forget the Royal Academy's exhibition last year about these people. We need to keep isolating them.

Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now.

Alclad (technicality)
Under the """"Ford Airplane Company"""" section, Alclad is stated to be a """"new alloy ... that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin"""" This is incorrect. Aluminum is an element, and Duralumin is an alloy itself of Aluminum. You can't characterize an alloy as being made of an element and another alloy.

But, If information arrives, which is factual, accurate and sourced. Regardless of editor. Should it be included? Isn't it a loss to WP? - And, is the Cello Sonata List (and this question applies to all open lists in WP) a list of all existing cello sonatas or only of certain Cello Sonatas to be determined by  administrators? 
In any case, thank you for your time in clarifying a lot about WP and its mechanisms. 

These are relevant quotes from information I have found in WP guideline pages:

""""Lists should always include unambiguous statements of membership criteria based on definitions made by reputable sources. """"

In this scase the list title is LIST OF CELLO SONATAS. So adding any existing and published cello sonatas should be valid unless the listing title is changed to narrow the list. I would suggest adding the criteria to Cello Sonatas that are in print or published. Do you agree?

And, I simply politely ask that if you have a problem with an entry, you tag the sentence or listing by adding the  or use another WP guideline way to allow for the editor to respond. Not simply arbitrarily remove. In particular with lists.

Thank you again for your time and I look forward to becoming more involved in the WP community. Kudos to all involved!

As an editor I have no problem with you adding or removing names from lists, and I encourage you to improve articles in any way you would like.  Regarding the list of cello sonatasthis is a problematic issue, and has to do with the evolution of Wikipedia.  Within the last couple years most of the embedded lists within articles have been moved to their own articles, but several years ago that was not the case (see the history of Renaissance music and List of Renaissance composers for an example).  Cello sonata is a sadly neglected article and needs a lot of improvement.

"""==What is Vietnam Advance Software Company?==
What is Vietnam Advance Software Company and why is someone in Vietnam defending CIA actions?   
I have no idea what Vietnam Advance Software Company is, why? And who cares what country I'm in? A) I happen to live in Vietnam, I don't see why that should make it strange if I express my views on certain wiki pages. If you don't believe me, feel free to read my blog: http://www.morethan3words.blogspot.com/ (sorry for the shameless plug, but I've been told I should self-promote more). And B) I actually am not defending the CIA, I've taken up the article as a pet project to learn more about how to use Wikipedia and interact with the wiki community before I take on bigger projects next spring. The views I express are not in defense of the CIA, but are actually in any effort to improve the CIA main page and make it more neutral and accurate. (  )
I have no idea what Vietnam Advance Software Company is, why?
Because the IP you used before you created this account was from Vietnam Advance Software Company. Maybe that is your web provider. I was just curious if you had heard of the company, since a Google search revealed a paltry 7 hits. And who cares what country I'm in?
Most people who criticize the section you removed are conservative Americans, not Vietnamese. Again, I was curious. 
I actually am not defending the CIA
Your IP statement was pretty strong.  It is the same tone of those who have wanted to defend the CIA before and who actively do POV deletions and moves. Maybe you are not defending the CIA.The views I express are not in defense of the CIA, but are actually in any effort to improve the CIA main page and make it more neutral and accurate.
It is easy for people to move sections they don't agree on. I applaud you for not deleting this section as some people do. 
It is harder, but much more productive to do this:  Counterpoints are welcome, and make the article stronger. Read the references provided and see if these articles are accurately written about in the CIA article. Editors and fact checkers on  wikiarticles are severely needed. 
I welcome your input into these sections. I look forward to working with you more.   
I think you have a slight misconception of my motives for moving the sections. Actually, I am not suggesting moving these sections because I actually DISAGREE with any of them, on the contrary, I have no basis to refute any of them. I think they should be moved to their own article because the topic, i.e., operations of the CIA, is so large and comprehensive it should have its own article. Furthermore, the CIA main page is too unwieldy as it is. Actually, under the current form, I think it discourages people from reading about the operations because it's simply too much text, placed after they have already read an extensive amount about the CIA history, organization, etc. Counterpoints won't do any good but to make the page MORE complicated and unwieldy. You're right, fact checking is important for these sections, but also very difficult to adequately accomplish for even seasoned jouranlists and academitions. This only furthers my point that it is something that should not take place on the CIA main page because it will inherently cause the page to be in too much constant flux and flow. (  )
Although you argue that you are not a defender of the actives CIA, I personally think the way you describe the criticism section of the CIA  as User:203.162.205.60 and User:Morethan3word show a clear POV bias. 
You are in good company. Thus far, every single one of the editors who want this section moved are conservatives with clear POV bias, which is seen in their edits and edit warring. Ultramarine is incredibly conservative and has been known to delete large sections text which just happen to conflict with his personal conservative POV, so it is no surprise that he supports such a move.
Thus far, every single one of the editors who want this section to remain have clear POV bias (like me), which is seen in their edits and edit warring.

"""::::::: Hi everyone this is the first time I've closely examined this page. I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the """"rules"""" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (""""blocking pedestrian traffic"""" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called """"crowd control policing"""", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact.

 It confuses users who are editing the page at the same time as you, as my confusion was when we edited Dayne Beams at the same time and you had only updated his game count and not the stats update time, and therefore I almost added an extra game to him.
 The number of edits a user has is almost meaningless. Nobody looks at this number, and a user's quality isn't judged by the number of edits, but rather by the quality of the edits.
 It floods the watchlist and the recent changes list and makes it harder to spot if other users have made inappropriate edits.
 (adding this one now) Micro-editing takes more time, which you could use for other things, such as bettering a larger number of articles.

We would all very much appreciate if you desist from this practice.

Thanks,

  

 I fully support all four comments. Cheers,   

 Following up from your answer on my talk page, Yes we would like you to do the whole stats change in one edit. In one edit change from """"Player with X goals in Y games as of round Z"""" to """"Player with X+1 goals in Y+1 games as of round Z+1"""". Also, it is bad form to delete other users' posts from your talk page, unless you are archiving them.   """,0

 Suggestion on Signpost archieves 

Hi, I'm trying to check a quote by Jimbo I just paraphrased (End of Talk:List of fictional universes#Where_does_this_end.3F, and in parsing the archives wished you all thought to do this: Use the Template:succession to allow scanning archive to archive (See bottom monarchy's, say Hugh Capet for example, or The_Honor_of_the_Queen#Masadans to show how flexible this little template can be!) so when someone is running down something they saw, they can pop from version to version with next to no fuss.

If you find merit in the idea, I'll be glad to lend a hand retrofiting the older stuff. Just drop me a note. I need something to keep me off the streets when Europe goes to sleep, the system runs fast, and I'm too burned out to cognate on proper sentence formation! Back to looking for that interview link!

"Hey Sue, How are u. from u know who

Hey Sue Anne, how are you?

Hope you are as fine as always.

Looks like the petty cabal has been upto something on my IP userpage. LOL.

Some of the cabal must have jumped in, looking at the edit history, maybe because they were smarting when I pointed out their ways. LOL. I feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. LOL.

Your message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. LOL.
Would you be bothered enough to put it in place again?
The cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. HAHAHAHAHA.

I did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because I already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. LOL. I only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.

A few things did come out of the incident.

Crossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me.
He further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message Vesther had sent me to which I had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message, LOL. Even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! LOL.
He further did not even warn Vesther, but he warned me for using those words, Vesthers words, which I only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! LOL.

So, the result is that Crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be UNFAIR, BIASED and grossly INCOMPETENT to be an admin. Who makes these guys admins??? LOL.

As for Mr. Royboy, LOL. The less said about him the better. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA.
Who made this guy admin? Where did he come from? Who IS he?
What explanation did he give for blocking AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME?
Me and Crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which Vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere?
It was a total and absolute DISGRACEFUL abuse of admin priveleges. Too bad I foiled it.
I guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. I sympathize with his condition.

Some people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki I guess, Vesther being a case in point.
Is it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? LOL.

Anyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!! 
And I hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, I mean un-blocking.

I guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, LOL. And after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. They must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the SPECIFIC ISSUE IN QUESTION later on. LOL.

I sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.

No reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! LOL.

But Now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways.
LOL.

So, by extrapolating this, I have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. LOL.

All the more reason its needs me. LOL.

I wont let you down wiki. LOL.

Of course, there must be many good decent admins like you.

A few words about my messages I had sent.

With regard to Vesther, we both know what I feel about him. HAHAHAHAHA. LOL.
But to be fair, its not his fault really. Its the incompetent power-mad admin's fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties. LOL.

Vesther just couldnt take it I guess after I repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. LOL. I guess he's not used to it. Maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. LOL. Too bad. I see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend Crossmr who Did Not give him a warning for the very same words. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

And he has further archived the discussions. Hmmmmm. Not a bad idea, when do u think I should archive that now-useless page, as it is",0

I cannot access the text and would like to see it. I also think picking 1840 is arbitrary.  This source which provides a population table for Jerusalem from 1806 - 1945 on page 28 indicates that in 1838 the population was 11,500 people (4,500 Muslims, 3,500 Christians, and 3,000 Jews); in 1846 the population was 17,173 (6,100 Muslims, 3,558 Christians, and 7,515 Jews) and that in 1851 it was 25,354 (12,286 Muslims, 7,488 Christians, and 5,580 Jews).

The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): """"But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."""" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: """"Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."""" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the """"statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"""" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.
It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding """"as some hold"""". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.

Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.

There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.

In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.

The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. 

Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.

I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.

It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound",0

Thanks for soliciting my opinion. There seems to be little support for adding awards and such to infoboxes:
Infobox Musical artist
And templates for awards of the """"magazine's top ten list"""" type tend to be deleted:
Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame inductees
I don't have a strong opinion in the matter, but it seems the general preference is to not have awards templated at all, but rather mentioned in the article body text where appropriate, and omitted when such mention gives undue weight to the award. If a template like this is to gain acceptance, it needs to be less intrusive. Putting the 500 Greatest list in the article infobox is the most intrusive possible placement, suggesting that Rolling Stone's perspective on a record is as essential an element as the release date—even I consider that undue weight.

If you still want to try this, my suggestion would be a collapsible box placed much lower in the article, the way  is placed at the bottom of Miles Davis. However, it might be a good idea to seek feedback on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Songs before putting much work into this. /  ☺ ☭ 17:00, 1 May""",0

 This is just completely very big lie of some fanatic Greek Cypriots:
 After the hostilities in 1974, population transfers were made in accordance with the Voluntary Population Exchange Agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots (Third Vienna Agreement) under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975;United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 02.08.1975 United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 2 August 1975. the Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada and Catholic Maronite Cypriots in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis agreed to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and stayed in the north and Turkish Cypriots in Limassol agreed to live under Greek Cypriot administration and stayed in the south of the Cyprus island. 
If all of the Greek Cypriots had chosen to stay in north of Cyprus, then all of them have been living in north of Cyprus just as the ones who chose to stay in north of Cyprus and are still living in north of Cyprus! 

 Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have NO right to return back after 40 years they chose their side in 1974!: 
 1. United States Federal Court decision (09.10.2014):""""..Greek Cypriots cannot claim that the government in control of Northern Cyprus gave their homes to Turkish Cypriots....Although the United States does not recognize it as a state, the TRNC purportedly operates as a democratic republic with a president, prime minister, legislature and judiciary...TRNC is not vulnerable to a lawsuit in Washington"""".

 The VERY Naive Perspective 

This was stated:

'There was no implication that ALL VNR's are propaganda.  If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda, which I infer is undisputed, then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral.'

Separated into two concepts: 
a) that """"There was no implication that ALL VNRs are propaganda."""" 
-and-
b) """"If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda ... then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral."""" 

In regards to the first:-
A Video """"News"""" Release by the government, which is ( as they, a priori, are ) intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is, by definition, propaganda.
In regards to the second:-
Is the statement that the labeling of VNR's is an ideologically neutral act?  It would not be, as, through labeling it, one is categorizing it ideologically. 

Please do not misunderstand, IMHO VNR's are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea """"The Fish do not see the Water"""". In Communication Studies, Propaganda Studies, even Neuro-Linguistic Programming NLP( which, while it is a controversial system, is based on common-sense """"slight of mind"""" techniques.) the Sandwich Formula of:
/true statement -> statement intended to be perceived as true -> true statement/
is being used here. Example: 6 o'clock news, tired Americans sit down to eat and watch the news. In the middle of verifiable and true information segments a VNR is placed, so the end effect of 'Rain tomorrow //-> VNR Information //-> Gas is up by 1 cent' is to believe 3 new facts, not 2 and one to question.

Its is common knowledge in South India as to who the Sengunthar/ Kaikolar are and its not my problem if you've been living in a very close knit community or unaware of this.

1. The following is quoted from a legitimate third party website. http://globalindiamissions.org/newsletter/nwsltr0802.htm

The Kaikolan are a large Tamil and Telugu caste of weavers. There are seventy-two subdivisions (nadu or desams). Their name comes from a mythical hero and from the words """"kai"""" (hand) and """"koi"""" (shuttle). They consider the different parts of the loom to represent various gods and sages. They are also known as Sengundar, which means a red dagger, which is traced to the legend of the earth being harassed by demons, which led to the people asking the god Shiva to help them.

Traditionally, one girl in every family was set apart to be dedicated to temple service and becomes a """"Devdasi"""" (meaning female servant of god). In the temple, the girl is considered married to the temple deity but in practice becomes a prostitute, especially to the Brahmans and she learns traditional music and dancing.

2. This is taken from a journal research article with abundant valid references. This is as legitimate as it gets.

This article talks in much detail about how women from the Sengundhar/ Kaikola caste get into the sacred prostitution in temples.

""""Contending identities: Sacred prostitution and reform in colonial South India Priyadarshini Vijaisri A1, A1 Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi"""" South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies Publisher: Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group Issue: Volume 28, Number 3 / December 2005 Pages: 387 - 411

To view the complete article just register, its free.

Here are the links 

http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/link.asp?id=jv31l27518262711 If you cannot access it then just go to the following page and follow one of the links

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q;=Contending+identities%3A+Sacred+prostitution+and+reform+in+colonial+South+India

3. This is taken from another legitimate webiste http://www.go2southasia.org/l_peoples.html of a world renknown organisation recognised by many countries. They have no gain in just picking on the Sengunthar caste.

The KAIKOLAR people are a caste of weavers 1.5 million strong in southern India. They are Hindus and view different parts of the loom as representations of various gods and sages. Traditionally, each Kaikolar family sets aside one daughter to serve in a Hindu temple. That daughter is considered married to the temple deity—often the Hindu destroyer god Shiva. In practice, the daughter becomes a temple prostitute.

All 3 of the above references are quite legitimate and I can quote many more. There is no question of coincidence or any error in any of these sources.

I think there's a fundamental disconnect with this article and it starts with piece on lambda calculus. There is need of a bridge between the historical work and computing languages: Ada Byron developed some notation for the algorithmic computing, so programming paradigms should trace back at least to her. In 1963, John McCarthy wrote a seminal paper A basis for a mathematical theory of computation found In Computer Programming and formal systems. North-Holland.

So you haven't done your homework, you refuse to read or listen to the answers to your questions and then you delete the references that have them.  You are quite a piece of work.  What happened to freedom of speech and free open honest discussion where people can be swayed by reasoned thought?

I am curious what all the other wiki editors who have been following this think.  Of course it will be difficult for them to research the sources you have removed and now locked out.  How about that.  

Suggestion: if you were really as honest as you like to think you are, you would put both articles on the page for everyone to read and vote on.  Yours as it now is, and mine as I last left it.

It says in the instruction to new editors to assume good faith.  That has not been my experience of you, and from my point of view, you have now demonstrated that beyond any doubt.
There are other issues here.  Everywhere I look in wikipedia I see poorly written, out of date articles, or articles with messages requesting that someone update them.  I am curious how many others have had similar experiences to what I have had here and who have lost interest and moved on? Does anyone keep track of wikipedia's hit count and how it has changed over the years?  Or the number of active wiki editors?  I wouldn't be surprised one little bit to find out it both have leveled out and gone into decline.  If so, has it occurred to you that that might be a signal of some sort?
This issue also points out another major flaw in wikipedia; the fact that a single admitted non-expert in a field of study can override multiple experts from NASA, Lockheed Martin, JPL, etc., on a topic as you have done here. 

You have some serious issues here.  I will be interested in seeing how you resolve them, assuming that you can.  Or will this article remain as it now is, another stone in the constipated belly of wikipedia, for years to come?

I just had an idea.  I am going to put the article as I last left it right here so that the other wiki editors who have been following this can read and compare without editorials from either of us.  
It will be interesting to see if you have the courage to leave it alone and allow others to form their own opinion and do their own research.

A skyhook is a proposed space transportation concept that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. 

Skyhooks are often confused with an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator, but they are different.  A skyhook is much shorter than a space elevator and does not reach down to the surface of the Earth.  A skyhook requires a suborbital launch vehicle to get to the bottom end of the skyhook, a space elevator does not.  Due to the much shorter length of the skyhook and the resulting reduction in strain, skyhooks up to 4,000 km in length can be built with existing materials, while an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator cannot.Amanda S. Wu, Tsu-Wei Chou, """"Carbon Nanotube Fibers for Advanced Composites"""", Materials Today, vol. 15, July–August 2012, pp. 302-310   

The advantage of a skyhook it that the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude.  As a result, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook can carry a larger payload than it could going directly to orbit on its own.  When the cable is long enough, single stage to skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle such as a spaceplane becomes possible.  Reusability of the launch vehicle and an enlarged payload fraction makes for much lower launch costs.   Once the cable has become long enough the skyhook becomes cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator (assuming a space elevator can ever be built), and the skyhook can be built.{{cite jour",0

"""Read this Article

It all started about 3 months ago. An innocent girl was diagnosed of (curable) kidney cancer at Eko Hospital. All was well from the beginning, she was admitted and went through the operation of removing one kidney (primary source of the cancer). After all the fear for the worse, prayers and the pains she went through, the operations was successful and all was well again. She started gaining back her weight, cracking jokes and doing every continued living normally.

She was discharged from the hospital, and was told to come back in the next couple of weeks to start (radiotherapy treatment) (Doomed)
We all know what radiotherapy involves and there is nothing wrong in the treatment, but the manner the patient was been treated using the new radiotherapy device, with little or know knowledge of how it operates.

She has to go through a one month of the radiotherapy treatment, 6 mins per day. Monday to Friday every week. Now she's lost plenty of weight, loss of appetite, always in pain, vomiting and diarrhea and every radiotherapy symptoms you can think of. By now, the fear in the family is intensely growing.

I believe a patient in that kind of situation should be in an intensive care of the hospital in question, but eko hospital sent her home with some paracetamol. They said, in the next couple of weeks she would be fully okay and they insisted in her continuation of the treatment.

By now, everything you can think of is happening to this little girl, she's as skinny as you can describe it. From time to time she asks if she's going to survive this, and everyone around her said yes based on what they were told at Eko Hospital, one person accidentally said, """"madam I'll tell you the truth, your day is doomed and she will not make it, just take her home and pray for the rest of her life."""" patient mother confronted the doctors with this matter and they said that """"the head nurse that shared that information does not work in their department and knows nothing about what she's talking about"""".

To cut the very long story short, on the 2nd of October, yesterday, she has to be rushed into the hospital, she said """" I don't want to stay at home, I want to be in the hospital, I believe I will be okay when we get to the hospital"""" When they got to the nearest hospital to their home, they refused her why, because they do not have loads of cash at hand at that moment in time, they progressed further to the next hospital where they required instant deposit as well. Then finally progressed to a further hospital where instant cash is also required.

She herself begged the last doctor, because she doesn't want to go home. Now the time is 1.am all at home trying to make this poor girl comfortable as she was in pain all over, this is a very bright 19 year old girl for God's Sake. 2 am, now she's now twitching all over, and mumbling some word we do not understand. the last sensible sentence she made was """"you, you, you have new clothes, I'm happy for you o, I will tell my daddy and my mummy they will buy clothe for me too""""

They had to rush her to EKO Hospital, at the early hours of the morning, like about 4.30 am, right outside the hospital she was confirmed dead!

She'll be buried today Wednesday, October 2007. Another potential Nigerian youth gone.

Although, she's gone, I want you guys to know that this is something that can happen to anybody. Though cancer is not actually the course of her death, but the treatment given to her and the manner the treatment was used.

Key Points
Misleading Information by eko hospital to patient family
throughout this ordeal, only 1 blood transfusion was done.
On her death certificate primary course of death """"Malabsorbtion"""" secondary course of death """"renal failure"""" Note not cancer.
This is poor negligence, this girl would have been alive if not for the negligence.

I want the medical lawyers in this forum to shed some light, at the moment, take me as a very angry man, because the 19 year old angel is my baby sister.

Update1
At the burial ground a doctor had to be called out on emergency, because when her friends asked to open the casket to see her face for the last time, she was sweating. All hope high again, like there's going to be another miracle of the century, we were all confused and wondering why someone confirmed dead will be sweating.

Though we'd thought that it's possible because' she'd just been brought out of ice,  But when a doctor arrived he reconfirmed her dead, and he said that the sweating is possible due to some reasons he mentioned, 

Anyway we've buried her now, but another question arises, was she actually dead or unconcious when they confirmed she was dead?, Cos the staff that",0

Speedy deletion of A nightmare on elm street prequel

""":* I drafted an different reply to your note above.  But I decided the best course today is to request userification of the article and its talk page.

 The nominator, and a large fraction of those who voiced a """"delete"""" opinion, apparently felt it was appropriate to make extensive excisions to the article  while it was before .  This is what I meant by """"informationectomies and referencectomies"""".  Our policies don't specifically prohibit this behavior, but I think it is a terrible idea, because it is best for the project for those who think the article should be kept to be allowed a free hand to try to address whatever concerns were voiced in the .  

 I think that it is terribly erosive of the general store of collegiality, civility and good will we should all aim to maintain, when those in the delete camp edit war in articles while they are before , and should confine themselves to voicing their concerns in the .  As I wrote in the , even if, for the sake of argument, everyone but those in the keep camp felt the keep case was hopeless, those in the keep camp will feel the  was fatally disrupted by this kind of edit warring.  Whereas, if the delete camp are disciplined enough to refrain from interfering with the efforts of the keep camp, in the actual article.  If they can keep their hands off the article everyone, including those in the keep camp, can't speculate that the article would have been kept, if it hadn't been for the edit warring.

 Anyhow, due to their disruptive efforts, the article, when deleted, was not at its best state, when you closed the discussion.  If you reversed yourself, and restored the article to article space, it would probably be nominated, a second time, almost right away.  If and when it is restored to article space I would prefer to defend a version of the article that shows no echo of the disruptive edits of those in the delete camp.

New Louisville definition
Since the Census Bureau has clearly defined the new Louisville as only the old city and unincorporated areas, I think there some details needed that need to be added defining Metro Government. First, it is important  to note that a KY Legislative bill (dubbed the Lyndon Bill} prohibits suburban cities from annexing more land. If this were not the case then the unincorp. areas could create their own government and only the old city would again be left.  Second, this definition won't effect the new city's population growth, since nearly all growth is in the unicorpirated areas and nearly all suburban cities are having very slow growth or even populatiuon losses. Third, even if Suburban cities don't count toward the population, their residents can still vote for Metro mayor and council members, and will still receive Metrowide help in such areas as urban planning and emergency services.
Personally, I think the official municipality (the entire county) is what should make up this article, regardless of what the Census Bureau says. The smaller article with the """"balance"""" is what should have the information for the census-defined city.  
Your ideas of what the census bureau has defined are not correct. What you are referring to is the Louisville-Jefferson County balance, which is not the same thing as consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County. Both are defined separately by the Census Bureau (see here). This article is about the consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County (which is how the city is legally incorporated). The confusion lies in the Census Bureau's use of balance figures when ranking cities, rather than the consolidated figures. (Although even this use is inconsistant as they seem to use the full consolidated figures for the decennial rankings.)  
The Census Bureau has accepted the Louisville/ Jefferson balance, but not the City/County Consolidation, which is why the suburban populations are not counted in its estimates and won't be in future censuses. Because of the acceptence of the Lou/Jef Balance, my points should be brought up about the ban on suburban city annexation. If this were not the case then the Balance could be quickly eaten up by the suburbs.
Your assertion is not entirely correct. The Census Bureau does, in fact, include the entire consolidated Louisville-Jefferson County in their estimates. They also include a separate figure for the balance:
 170,Louisville/Jefferson County,Kentucky,A,693604,693872,694757,695843,698059,698903,699827
 162,Louisville/Jefferson County (balance),Kentucky,A,551183,551390,552058,552828,554381,555366,556429
That's from the 2005 estimates (the last number is the 2005 estimated population). This article is not about the balance, however. Issues involving the balance should be discussed on the balance article's talk page.  

 Actual Population 
There are too many disputes about the population of the actual city proper. According to the Census bureau estimates, the balance population is 556,429 and not anywhere near 700,000. What is the actual city proper population, as that is to be what is listed? I do not believe that Louisville has a population anywhere near that of Columbus, Ohio. We need to decide the official population of the city proper and correct any and all inaccurate statements regarding the actual population. There are several pages in Wikipedia listing the population as 699,000 (or so), when the Census lists the population as 556,429. I understand that several people (especially those who live in the area) want the population figure to be high so the city can reach a higher status. If it was a city I lived in, I would like to do the same. However, that cannot be done here. An actual, correct population for the city proper and the metro needs to be listed. If we are able to, we need to come up with the balance population of the counties and the actual city. I am a little confused myself, and I did not want to attempt to change anything before it is discussed.  

There have been many people who have debated this over and over again and we have come to the consensus that is now demonstrated in the article.  Please, for the sake of your own knowledge, read all the talk archives that cover this situation.  Since there is a consensus that's currently overwhelmingly not in your favor, you might want to do that research before thinking about flaming things up. — [[User:Stevietheman|",0

We are always bound by WP:V as one of the five pillars of Wikipedia, but when what we are writing is potentially legally actionable against the Wikipedia Foundation, there is an urgency attached as well.

I don't know the original basis of this style, but it's a fact that it is the style presently used on Wikipedia.

Leaving out Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa for a moment, do you mean that you doubt he received recognitions such as this? You seem to be making the point that because you cannot find these recognitions in the press that they are somehow forgeries or myths? Hey, they ain't the Nobel Peace Prize but they are not fake. You seem to be mixing up three issues; 1) whether Hubbard led an extraordinary life and 2) whether he received extraordinary recognition as a humanitarian and 3) how Scientologists generally regard Hubbard. Those issues are not related. I think that even critics will agree that Hubbard led an extraordinary life. And neither 1) nor 2) are really related to his """"personality"""" either. I mean, was/is Mandela a bad husband? Did/does he have a temper? Who knows, you certainly won't find out in our article on him. But if someone decided to write a smear piece on him I am sure that they can find as many people that will say something bad about his """"personality"""" as we see in our Hubbard pieces. Re 3) This is not about my having some """"faith"""" or other, this is about how I have view Hubbard after intimate experience with his creations, Dianetics and Scientology and reading, IDK, millions of his words, and listening to hundreds of hours of lectures. I think that entitles me to have an opinion without getting all mystical and talking """"faith"""". I am sorry that you are getting frustrated but the simple point is that so long as the """"truth"""" about Hubbard as I see it (which, incidentally, factors in the criticisms) does not seem to be in the press then I will feel that what is there is undoubtedly one-sided.

We don't really have a """"too many of X"""" argument for any Main Page content. The only semi-similar thing is the way that TFA nominations are penalised if a similar article has run within a particular period, but that approach doesn't map over onto DYK, which has no points system and a vastly higher throughput of articles daily. DYK's approach is and always has been that if content meets the requirements, it gets accepted. Also, it's not as if a surplus of articles in a particular topic area are holding up other articles appearing in DYK. As I said, it has a fairly high throughput in any case and even a large number of articles on a single topic - I mentioned 300 Indonesia articles in the course of a year - gets lost in the total number of articles that appear in the slot.   20:39""",0

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0

I would be surprised since she told me that she put it here.  I suppose it could be possible.  I made my decision primarily on an extensive personal review of the site.  It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikki's personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.  At any rate, the reason we have guidelines, such as Wikipedia:External_links#Links_normally_to_be_avoided, is to give us guidance in such instances.

"Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human==
Shocking news break.  It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me!  A real 

person.... not a 'sock puppeteer.'  There are no socks and no puppets.  Just a real person who thought that a 

business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia.  Someone who actually understands the business he is 

in, unlike the editors, who have no experience in the field whatsoever.

It turns out- or so we can surmise, that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company.  Oh no!  

This can't be!  It's a business... not an encyclopedic fact!  

But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world.  otherwise, why does it exist?  

Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient.

Geekish editors have said that listing this company is 'blatant advertising.'  Yet other advertising companies, like 

Modernista, BBDO, DDB, Ogilvy, etc. are all here... blatant advertising.  So, how big does a company have to be to 

be listed on Wiki?  The answer- there is no answer.  It's all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor 

experience in business, who call themselves Carbuncle, Smeff, Dongfart, and the rest.  This is surely detrimental to 

the Wiki.

Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this?  The very idea of limiting what is shown here- censoring 

pure facts arbitrarily- is against the very idea of a global Wiki.  The great big idea is that this site is 

developed by the people of the world, and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias, which have been 

around for hundreds of years, do not or cannot include.

To my mind, and all the other sane, normal people of the world, this is all ridiculous.  

Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest.  It is a shortcut to thinking.  And clearly there is 

very little thinking here.  

I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they cannot find ISM on Wikipedia, and many from 

people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research.  Everyone 

was rebuffed.  What kind of person would do this- what kind of person would sit in their little room, hiding 

information from others, and trying to keep reality away at any cost?  Sock Puppets?  Suspicious users?  Legal 

threats?  What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who 

originally wrote the article and who always- ALWAYS - asked for editor input and support?

Go on- look at the history.  You will see that editor input was always taken at first, despite the fact that all 

editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject.  When asked to explain themselves, no one 

had the nous to do so.  Delicious Carbuncle, BlueBoy, Todd1, Fisher Queen, etc.   All refused to answer for their 

actions.  Cowards and buffoons who have no sense, courage, nor intelligence. 

Anyone who makes an attack on another person, as these 'editors' have, and runs away without facing the person they 

have attacked, is  not deserving of their powers.  

I am now convinced that Wikipedia, despite it's noble origins, is just a place for fools to feel power in a world 

where they are unable to have any in reality.  Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site.  You 

have no argument and have no intelligence- if you think you do, face me like a real human- talk, discuss, and the 

rest.  Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid, sarcastic comment and run away... hiding... and never respond to 

your comments.

Citations and External Link
I checked all the links and they work; which is good. Conversely, the 'Chronicles' definitely should not be listed as an external link. There are many other relevant links regarding the Round Table. A forum posting should not be used as something reliable. Also we should continue to discuss the state of the 'Contributing Attendees.' I checked some of the names and they had third party sources. Should they be added again since all Wikipedia needs is third party sources.   
Thanks for the check. I disagree about deleting the Chronicle website link. The 2007 THE article establishes that that discussion is notable. Yes, it is anonymous, but it is a discussion board for active academics. A truck driver would not be able to construct a useful post for that thread. And anonymity has virtues as well as vices: anonymity makes it possible to say what you really think without fear of reprisal, though at the risk that people will spread misinformation without fear of getting caught. Many of the posters in that Chronicle thread have track records in other threads that make what they say more reliable than it would otherwise bekind of like Wikipedia.
As for the """"Contributing Attendees,"""" I am skeptical that we can create something that isn't Listcruft, but it would be a lot easier to evaluate if you proposed a specific edit with genuine third-party sources.  

 The CHE is not being used as a source. External links are different from sources.   

Well my problem with the Chronicle for Higher Learning is that it seems to be very odd to me for some reason. I just have read the 'External Link' requirement page and the Chronicle for Higher Learning breaks several of the rules. Please read WP:EL under 'Link to Be Avoided' and the Chronicle forum/discussion/blog breaks all of a good amount of rules. I was drawn to the External Links because when I was attempting to fine info regarding the Table, many other links that could not be cited in the article because of Wiki guidelines, seem like they are much more revelant than the Chronicle blog for External Links. I propose adding another link and removing the Chronicle link because it does not adhere to Wiki guidelines. Academic38, your statement regarding who posts to the board can neither be confirmed or denyed because the postings are anonymous and nothing can be proven. It could be truck drivers with no idea about what they are talking about or otherwise; that is why Wiki discourages forums as reliable External Links. More discussion needed, but I am going to suggest the Chronicle be removed. It is already referred to under the THE explanation and does not need to be listed as an 'External Link.'   

I read WP:EL and I don't see that it breaks any rules. What rules are you claiming it breaks? You really need a stronger argument than """"it seems to be very odd to me for some reason."""" The December 2007 THE story has already validated the Chronicle link.  

 , It's a bit rich to start invoking """"rules"""" here, when you have conspicuously failed to do so in response to repeated requests above.  In any event, as you yourself have pointed out here, there is a distinction to make between policies and guidelines.    

I disagree that the Times article justifies the link to a """"blog."""" It can be argued that it justifies a link to the 'Chronicles for Higher Education"""" website but not to a blog that God knows who started. Academic38, you claim that my only argument is """"it seems odd..."""", however this is not true. If you read carefully the WP:EL under the section """"Links To Be Avoided"""", you would have your answer as to why the link to the 'Chronicle' blog is not up to the guidelines at all. Nomoskedasticity, I am not attempting to use rules only when it seems fit. You and Academic38 are asking me to point out regulations in the posts above and yet now you are stating that even though the """"Chronicle"""" blog link breaks Wiki guidelines, I should be okay with it because I was having a discussion about other rules above. No, that will not work for this page. I will discuss things with the other editors on this page, but I will not be bullied into not asking",0

While I am somewhat dissapointed by D'Adamo's lack of footnotes, and frustrated by his avoidance of indexes, I haven't yet found a credible direct dispute to any significant claims of his.

While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified.  Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to protoscience than unfalsifiable pseudoscience. 
In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic.  Is the mere mention of Doctor D'Adamo, or Eat Right For Your Type (ER4YT) enough to invalidate the respose I offered?  Other than that vague stigma, is my above answer to the utility of divergent blood types unhelpful or incorrect? I do believe that I was careful enough to avoid anything that wasn't NPOV.

Some of the sections also cover information that would be better places elsewhere (as previously noted, in addition to mentioning Smart's Emmys in """"Concept and creation"""", it seems that would be better elsewhere or at least belongs in a subsection).

 Goodbye everybody 

And what on earth is wrong about this article, specially if settet back where it originally belongs?
I do not accuse people to be socket puppet, I do not insult them with harsh and very illustrativ words, I do not call their articles for garbage or for saying nothing usefull, or for being idiots, nor ignorant, nor do I pretend that they do not contribute with anything on the talk page and never did, nor do I revert other users contributions, as YBM and rjb specially and mainly, as well as some other new users on the page like Maru that night and previous days did, and som other users belonging to the same side of the story.
If I had to be banished for that so had ybm and rjb and maru too and for a much longer period of time and their text to be removed, in fact all of them that night, as they didn't say much else but cynical and fruitless comments on other people works and destructiv critiscism who wasn't justify.
I tried more than 4 times to make them come v´back to ttheir mind and to sopt healding oil to the fire, but it didn't helped. They just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished.
An objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what I state here is.
There is a text that I do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister Jean Pierre Voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with YBM in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story.
I also received private mails from a mister Rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of YBMs' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of Voyer, and with links to Luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. It does not concern the Bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so.
It's a hobby of some sort, like some like Shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes. 
There is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which I do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas.
I think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis Bogdanov affair. By vues I do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by YBM about the validity of the actual thesis. No. It isn't what it is about. It is more complex than that. It is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. Creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on.
It might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way.
It has roll this way for 2 years now, and the scenario are pretty much the same from a Forum to another.
One can see the same scenarios coming up, the same elements who keep coming back, the same strange behaviours at odd time, and the same surprising reactions when prooven wrong: a war take place, fill with denials, wild accusations, insults, personnal attacks, anything goes type of scenarios, with a lot of drama and tension in it, and many people getting injured, and leaving too. 
mostly those who came with the unbeatable arguments as I saw it so many times on fr. physic, from june to november 2004.
Looking at it after without having a part of it, give the priviledged view of the whole thing in a very short period of time , in one view, and here all those flaws are very obvious and it seems estonishing that nobody noticed it at the time. The game is very clear that way, and it was clear for me that there was something wrong going on, something who wasn't right, a mismatch.

"Coolceaser edits against UC Hastings 

Amerique:

Sorry to bug you, but I think you resolved the dispute with Coolceasar on the UC Hastings page very nicely.  I now note Coolceasar has been making biased (who knows why) assertions against Hastings on the general UC page, editing the page so the Hastings is not considered a UC but only an affiliated institution.  There is a long exchange back and forth between Cool Ceasar ands another Hastings grad (not me, I came in at the end), but I think the situation needs third-party input, somebody who didn't go to Hastings and can include their opinion on the evidence.

 Scientists Discuss """"Evolution"""" 

“My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief”. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).

“I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence”. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').

“I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program”. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').

“Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact”. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).

“The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do”. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).

“The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation”. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, ‘It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).

“The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation”. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).

“Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless”. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).

“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that life’s complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did”. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).

“A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these ‘Experts’ have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully”. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).

“The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination”. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).

“I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin’s theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all”. (H. Lipson, “A Physicist Looks at Evolution“, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).

“The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view”. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).

“(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century”. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, ‘Evolution, Theory in Crisis’).

“The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate”. (James Perloff, ‘Tornado in a Junkyard’, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).

“Evolution is faith, a religion”. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).

“Evolution is baseless and quite incredible”. (John Ambrose, ‘The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought’).

“Darwinism itself has become a religion”. (Norman Macbeth).

“There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the theory of evolution”. (Cecil Wakely).

There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.

The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.

Friedmans words are clearly quoted and clearly cited via the article linked to. A source you have removed for some reason. Do you have something to contribute from """"Blitzers side""""? Please, by all means include it. Is lack of something from """"Blitzers side"""" a reason to exclude citicism and delete a large chunk of the article? I dont think so. Unless you can actually defend your changes citing policy you will need to revert them. 

To clarify, yes, Near East Report is an AIPAC publication, as I said four days ago. Whether it was published by AIPAC in the 70s, I don't know, although it is likely. What we do know is that Blitzer started working for the JPost in 1973. He may very well have edited a version of """"Myths & Facts"""" in 1976, by the way, en edition of that book was published every two years. Plenty of journalists do outside work. Keep in mind that we are an encyclopedia. You need a reliable source thats says who he worked for and the dates. Pulling this information together from different primary sources is original research. You cannot quote somebody as calling Near East Report a """"propaganda sheet"""" any more than another editor can say """"Belfast is inhabited by """"drunken and violent"""" Irish people with the quote cited to Thomas Nast. You also can't cite three people attacking Blitzer's scholarship in Territory of Lies without any response from Blitzer or his supporters.  

Firstly, I wont respond to your silly example referring to where I live. Your racism is disgusting and reflects only on you but thats your problem.

Secondly, please dont further insult the intelligence of editors by implying that Near East Report was *possibly* published by someone else in 1970s. Blitzer edited the book ergo he worked for AIPAC, likewise he was editor of the weekly publication Near East Report into 1978. Source? The directoy listing showing his name listed as the responsible party at the weekly. He worked for them in 1976,77,78 regardless of whether you seek to portray that as """"outside work"""" or anything else. His name is on the front cover of the book as editor right? His name is listed in the weekly publication as editor right? Are those facts in dispute by you? 

Friedmans words are his own, you removed not only the quote whos inclusion you disagree with but all the other details. Fine, remove the quote, but removing everything else? Criticism of Blitzer does belong in the section detailing criticism. An automatic rebuttal isnt necessarily required if its a minority view and/or it cant be located.

Relevance of True Believers Syndrome
Andries, what is the relevance of adding a section about """"True Believers Syndrome""""? It appears you are pushing your POV by adding this section. Explain why you insist on adding this section and how it does not violate a NPOV.  talk-email 
It is relevant for the article: SSB is mentioned in the article True believer syndrome.  
You are pushing your Anti-Sai bias by including an empty reference to """"True Believers Syndrome"""". If you attempt to include it, I am going to remove it. I guess it is only coincidence that you happened to create the page for """"True Believers Syndrome""""? Ref  talk-email 
Well, the inclusion of this article in the see also section seems to be yet another subject for mediation, otherwise we'll keep reverting each other until one of us dies.  
Andries, the  Wikipedia policy WP:NOT states that Wikipedia is not a soapbox.  I suspect that we have differing views regarding what this means.  From my perspective, the aim of many of your edits, such as the one which sparked this subsection, appears to be to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.    I would very much like for you to share your views on the WP:NOT policy and your understanding of what this policy means.   
Please note that I had removed the true believer syndrome as described by Robert Todd Carroll from the main text in the article, because Jossi complained that people mentioned in this article were not notable. I objected to that by saying that everybody mentioned in this article was mentioned either by reputable media sources or scholarly sources that reported about SSB. Later I found out that the only one who was not mentioned by reputable news articles was Robert Todd Carroll who wrote entries in his book and website Skeptic's Dictionary about SSB and the true believer syndrome in which he mentioned SSB. So I decided to move the true believer syndrome from the main text to the see also section. I think it should stay there because it is clearly relevant for the article. With regards to violating the Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not policy I think that only one sentence could be relevant in this dispute and that is """"[Wikipedia is not] Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. """" I think I would be breaking """"What Wikipedia is Not"""" policy if I linked the word charlatan in the see also section, unless of course, SSB is mentioned in that article.  Of course, it will be clear that I do not agree with the critical information being minimized, but I do not think that I am breaking the policy here: SSB is very controversial and this article should reflect that.  
Andries, thanks for pointing this out. It is apparent I need to edit the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because its mention to SSB is not referenced by reputable sources. You attempt to make your case against SSB by citing the non-reputable and original research of Tony O'Clery and Paul Holbach. Either you reference these citations by reputable sources or I'm deleting it. I am going to remove the references to O'Clery and Holbach (whose link does not work anyway). Trying to cite the """"True Believer's Syndrome"""" article because it refers to SSB is deceptive because you were the one who made that reference to SSB on that page.  talk-email 
Hi Andries, thank-you for your response.  I am glad you agree that if you created a see-also link to charlatan that this would not reflect Wikipedia policies.  However, I do not understand your reasoning that seems to differentiate between a link to charlatan and a link to True Believer's Syndrome.  From my perspective, it seems that a see-also link to charlatan would be innuendo that SSB is a charlatan, while a  see-also link to TBS seems to be innuendo that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.  In both cases, it seems to me that NPOV is violated because controversial opinions are not presented as such.  Rather, the implication of a see-also link to TBS is that Wikipedia is voicing the opinion that devotees of SSB suffer from TBS.NEWLIN",0

I feel that I am compromising too much, since the entire criticism is based on a few mentions of the word genocide.  Much more often the term """"ethnic cleansing"""" was used, and the rest of the sentence you cut from the article, all of which is verifiable, """"and all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes, and all those little girls were raped, and all those little boys were murdered,"""" describes ethnic cleansing perfectly.  Are the few uses of the word 'genocide' indicative of the case made by the Clinton administration, or were the much more frequent references to ethnic cleansing the pillar of the argument?  I would say it was certainly the latter, but because he merely uttered the term genocide, proving my point would be a book-length endeavor.

"UNBLOCK - the question of integrity is not an issue for moderators?

Regardless of the WP:TRUTH that you seem to think you hold, Wikipedia works on a) WP:CONSENSUS, b) reliable sources, and c) a collegial editing environment. Your edits clearly show you're harassing an editor that you disagree with. You will not be permitted to continue that way. Please also note: stop typing in ALL CAPS - it's considered to be shouting, and that doesn't go over well on the internet (talk→ BWilkins ←track) 

Regardless of the WP:TRUTH that you seem to think you hold -  No, those rules are from WIKIPEDIA not me. What i dont see is you addressing the blatent biased opinion, synthesis, on an article which is viewed by others.

Please tell me does wikipedia allow ADMINS to hold a biased one sided opinion? When SIKH HISTORY admin have openly declared adherence to a strict orthodox viewpoint, you as MOD should really be enforcing wikipedias own rules on your own admin. You unblocking me is secondry to the blatent disregard for wikipedia rules on diet in sikhism. So its NOT MY truth that i hold, its wikikpedia rules that i hold, which YOU disregard. Now you have barred me, because you deem me argument on integrity an attack on ADMIN, when i have repeated over and over again, its an ISSUE of an article which is purely one sided. Now does wikipedia allow blatant disregard of rules from their own ADMIN? 

From the same scholar, same book, same ISBN NUMBER, one rejected and one accepted, the accepted statement fits in with the ADMINS own orthodox stance which he has openly declared on his Wikipedia page. 

1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are, 

“passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.",0

 This article is about the original application  it is NOT about a domain name 

I have cleaned up various inaccuracies in the starting paragraph and intent to continue.

The starting paragraph cited http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-indie-music-rights-agency-merlin-adds-tracks-to-p2p-network-imesh/ which states """"Lphant is now relaunched as a legal download P2P site but is still is still compatible with file-sharing networks such as BitTorrent"""" in an effort to phish users to download an application which uses the same name and elephant-like logo to the original one, but is neither created by the original author nor does it connect to BitTorrent.

Considering that no information has been published about the acquisition of the lphant application by anyone, the developments on the domain name are irrelevant to the article, aside from any information that will dissociate the original application to discordia's domains. In other words, Discordia's client does not have a place in this article. Neither does lphant.com anymore. As a result, there is no reason to link to lphant.com and especially not to shareaza.com which is attempted by certain users. Any links to shareaza.com especially under the name Shareaza are used to increase the page rank of the fake site on shareaza Google search queries.

Fortunately the original lphant.com site is still on the Internet Archive, so any request for citations about the original application will be satisfied. Since Discordia will probably try to remove the old information from the Internet Archive, it is suggested that as many editors as possible save them for future reference.""",0

I couldn't even guess how many genera there must be in total. Mus only accounts for a miniscule portion of the richness and diversity of the animals we call mice.

"Still, it's clear that Wulfila chose a lot of his spelling conventions based on those of Greek. Using 𐌴𐌹 to write a long [iː] was certainly one of those conventions, and another clear example is using 𐌲 to represent [ŋ]. He couldn't have based his choice of 𐌰𐌿 on Greek (because there it was becoming [af] rather than a long vowel), but for 𐌰𐌹 he probably was inspired by Greek. So what sound was αι in the Greek of the time? Was it higher than ε or lower? The page Koine Greek phonology shows that both were in fact homophones and had been already for hundreds of years before. So if he took those two writing conventions from Greek, he did not take their pronunciations as they are different in Gothic. That means that we have to derive the pronunciations of those two vowels from loanwords. What letters does Wulfila use to substitute for η in Greek loanwords? And what about Latin, which he no doubt knew as well? The Latin of the time had ĕ [ɛ] and ē [e], length distinctions were probably disappearing (see Vulgar Latin). So what does Wulfila use for these two Latin sounds?",0

The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""""
WP:No original research: """"The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""""

 Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri 

I would consider your move from Luis Miguel to Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri as a highly controversial renaming of an article. Please do not take offense, but I am positive that you are not familiar with this topic, or Spanish culture in general. Here are my thoughts on this:

 Luis Miguel is a singer of worldwide fame and much more notable than the other four Luis Miguels that you included in that disambiguation list.
 Luis Miguel is much more of a public figure than any other Luis Miguel, since he is a Grammy winner and is often romantically associated with big stars, such as Mariah Carey, Daisy Fuentes, etc.
 Please also note that """"Luis Miguel"""" is his professional name, and that is why he is notable, he is not a scientist or politician or any other profession where a full name is used. 
 Also only one of the other Luis Miguels has an article, therefore people looking for """"Luis Miguel"""" will be taken to that disambig page while almost all of them will be looking for the singer and not anybody else. 
 In addition, none of the other Luis Miguels go by """"Luis Miguel"""" only the singer. 

I will strongly suggest you moved the page back to Luis Miguel and create another Luis Miguel (disambiguation) page.

Hi. Do you think you could help me with my DYK for Lili Bosse, the current Mayor of BH? An editor suggested she may have lied about being the only daughter of Holocaust survivors, so another reference from The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles.

 WikiMarkup 

Wikipedia has it's own special """"language"""" called """"WikiMarkup"""". It is very important, therefore, to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article.

 Links 
 External links 
An external link is a link that goes to another website, besides Wikipedia. They are formatted like this: [Name of website goes here].
For example: [http://www.google.com] becomes . 
To display alternate text for an external link, type [Name of website goes here Alternate text goes here]. Note the space between the website's name and the alternate text.
For example: [http://www.google.com Google search engine] becomes Google search engine.

 Internal links 
An internal link is a link that links to any page within Wikipedia. They are formatted like this:[[Name of page goes here]]
For example: [[Giraffe]] becomes Giraffe.
An internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character """"|""""
For example: [[Giraffe|A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa]]. becomes A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa.
Normal text can also be blended into a link.
For example: I like [[Giraffe]]s. becomes I like Giraffes.
Internal links can link across namespaces.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] becomes Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.
They can also use Pipe tricks.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|]] (note the pipe character before the two end brackets) becomes Neutral point of view
For example: [[Orange (fruit)|]] becomes Orange.

 Redirects 

A redirect is a page that, if accessed, sends you to a related page automagically. For an example of this, see Gill net. Note how at the top of the page it says (Redirected from Gill net). Voila!
For example: #REDIRECT [[United States]] redirects whatever page it was on to United States.

 Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia -  

Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's """"Age of Navigation"""" surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,  

History Main article: History of Samoa
Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]

The origins of """"The Samoan Expansions"""" are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.

It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.

Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.At the final arrival of western exploration in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.

Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, """"The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.""""[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.

Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

"Ex-wife's book
We all know that Brando was openly bisexual and had affairs with James Dean and Wally Cox, but it is a fact that he was also a pedophile. I have a copy of his ex-wife Tarita's book which describes in great detail how he sexually abused his daughter Cheyenne, which is why she committed suicide after developing schizophrenia. Tarita even includes extracts from Cheyenne's diary in which she mentions the sexual abuse her father subjected her to. Whether or not Brando's fans can accept the truth about his private life is irrelevant, the article needs to mention this book. He might have been a good actor, but he was a very flawed character off screen. (172.213.30.174  )

Comment: 172.213.30.174's edit in Marlon Brando: “Only six months after his death, his third wife Tarita Teriipia published a memior in which she revealed that Cheyenne had recorded in her diary being sexually abused by her father.

The fact is that the book exists (I own a copy), Brando's daughter did accuse him of sexually abusing her, and Tarita herself has said her late husband was a bisexual pedophile. The article needs to mention these facts, whether you agree with them or not. (172.201.24.132  )",0

 Please! Help with the CNN article 

Hi, I am fairly new to Wikipedia. However, in looking at the CNN article, I noticed that in the beginning (fourth paragraph down) the following statement appears: """"Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. On the other hand, the academic literature (i.e., peer-reviewed, scholarly journals) is full of articles addressing CNN's bias. They have concluded that the public perceives CNN to have a liberal bias:
>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”) 
>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”) 

The administrator who semi-protected this article knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that (1) FAIR is a blatently unreliable source, and - equally important - (2) actual,peer-reviewed studies suggest precisely the opposite of the proposition that CNN is perceived as """"centrist."""" Would you please help in removing the unreliably-sourced, and inconsistent-with-real-literature statement concerning CNN's perceived """"centrist"""" position (it's semi-protected)? I would also like some help in getting the aforementioned articles detailing CNN's perceived liberal bias included in the CNN article. Thank you so much for your time.   """,0

""""Some 20,000 Jews currently live in Iran. The authorities allow them freedom to practice their religion, but forbid the import of Israel-made products to the country, an act that could cost a person three years imprisonment or the revoking of his passport for five years."""" 

While they probably didn't get an exact census of the people they were delivering to, I'd guess that they at least got the number reasonably correct. So 20,000 seems to be the way to go.

PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that """"a designer created flagella"""", science says """"no further information known"""". There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time.

"That’s not really long and irrelevant. I mean, I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things. Once he told me a story about myself (I’m not sure why I’d never been told it before by my family, but there you go, that’s families for you – not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family, they were quite nice, only you’d think that they’d tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me).

Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won’t get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I’ll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably):

Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn’t quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn’t have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember – she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, “So what?” But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it.

So this was, as you’ll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn’t help noticing the slightly random (and, I’ll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie’s mother’s pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use).

Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess’ mother’s pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own.

Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term “General”, including Major-General, and I don’t know if he was simply one of these, since they’re usually addressed simply as “General”, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully.

Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as “three-star general”, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn’t the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General.

Anyway, being a busy person, I can’t waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

Kind regards,

""""Concrete made possible the paved, durable Roman roads"""": so they were constructed with concrete? Needs a ref, and I think some explanation. Roman_roads#Construction_and_engineering says nothing about the use of cement or concrete?

In fact the whole Ancient_Rome#Technology section needs more referencing.

I have marked up a few sections, e.g. Punic Wars, Government, Economy, Games and recreation, that need more references.

There is scope for an image in Punic Wars - you could have Hannibal and Scipio side-by-side, perhaps.

""""Quaestors were made automatic members of the Senate"""". Perhaps they were automatically made members.

Adjectives are somewhat astray in some places, e.g. """"the famous Hadrian's Wall"""", the """"famously decisive Battle of Zama"""" - who says it's famous?

Image captions: there are many people here, over a very long time period, so dates might be a help in the captions.

The maps are noticeably in very different (ok, random) styles, which is quite distracting to the reader. It would be desirable (so, not a GA requirement) to harmonise these.

Thanks!
for the *. NawlinWiki (talk) 

My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk  
NalinWiki, you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? Kont Dracula (talk) 

I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about Wikipedia policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to Wikipedia in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk  
No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page.

Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:

1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?

2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) 

1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. 
Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one.

But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.

Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r",0
"""What was the point of this? Doesn't the Old Testament say the """"Amalekites"""" were supposedly destroyed; including even their women, children, and donkeys being exterminated? As for when the unrelated people, on the list of the relatively modern historical figures you mentioned, died what does that have do with anything? And I fail to see any supposed """"pattern"""" or anything as that seems to be what this section was trying to imply or something I assume. Also there are many Jewish holidays that span the calendar so different historical figures, who are obviously going to die anyway, are quite unsurprisingly and uneventfully going to die """"close"""" (a relative term as it is) to any of these many possibilities on different calendars.

 Some tips for you! 

Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

"Amirite Article 

Hi Greg Jack,

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases. This one for example is certainly not a paid release: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-opinions-online-amiritenet-amirite/ Makeuseof is a very well known site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeUseOf

I don't think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesn't mention adversarial on it.

"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

Well, all of that stuff came straight from either the NY appellate courts opinion or the US Supreme Court's opinion in that related case.  i will also try to find more sources.  This case is a landmark case because it established, for the first time ever, the civil tort of false light claims and what the elements of those claims are.  It was relied upon by SCOTUS as well as courts in all 50 states.  To be honest, this is probably the only thing this guy is known for (unless you lived way back in the 40's while he played).  That is why it is so important.  False light remains the least-recognized and most controversial aspect of invasion of privacy. See BRUCE W. SANFORD, LIBEL AND PRIVACY § 11.4.1 at 567 (2d ed. 1991) (""""Of Dean Prosser's four types of privacy torts, the 'false light' school has generated the most criticism because of its elusive, amorphous nature.""""); Diane Leenheer Zimmerman, False Light Invasion of Privacy: The Light that Failed , 64 N.Y.U.L.

Ct. 534, the United States Supreme Court has held that the tort of false light is consistent with First Amendment freedoms provided there is a finding of actual malice, knowledge of the falsity, or of reckless disregard of the truth. See also Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing Co., 419 U.S. 245, 251-53, 42 L. Ed. 2d 419, 95 S. Ct. 465.

Suggestions

(1) Might it be useful to """"update"""" Wittgenstein's contributions to various academic and philosophical inquiries? It seems that Wittgenstein's use of language games and place of language in experience has experienced something of a revival among some postmodern academics. 

In particular, his own transition from """"representational"""" to """"lived"""" semiotic is in itself interesting as a presage of the movement from a """"representational"""" to a """"community"""" derivation of language / meaning. 

I'm no Wittgenstein expert (just stumbled upon this interesting, if frustrating, discussion) and any credentials I might have had to the """"philosopher's club"""" have probably long expired, but a part of my doctoral work did float in and around meaning, words, classification and the uses we make of themvia semiotics. Thus I am eminently unqualified to write such a piece, though I can see a hole on the bookshelf where something like it might just fit. 

That is, philosophy did not end with Adorno, or even with Habermas. Some young buck out there, can you tell whether this connection (Wittgenstein's work on language and postmodern approaches to community-as-language) has developed at all in contemporary (21st century) philosophical work? 

Might be nice to see something pragmatic as well as historic. . .(of course they are not mutually exclusive. . .)

(2) On the issue of Wittgenstein's alleged personal quirks:

Given the absolute delight with which students of philosophy embrace all that is eccentric in the lives of the authors with whose works they are cursed to try and read (see Philosopher's Song. . .any campus)

and 

the somewhat unsettling popular idea that the most brilliant men (almost always men) are proportionately looney (perhaps explaining the less-brilliant lives of mostly normal people?) as well as

the difficulty of actually nailing down with precise sources most of what happened in Europe during either of the """"world wars,"""" but in particular the secondthere was an awful lot of bombing and burning by both sides

it might be difficult to come up with primary source material that would either confirm or deny even positions held forth in academic lectures but unpublished, let alone personal eccentricities (after all, if the people writing about these eccentricities were themselves brilliant, their own opinions of normalcy should be correspondingly suspect, see the """"it takes one to know one"""" argument)

So

perhaps we should cobble together a """"tribute"""" page to which all of the strange and probably unprovable and just as probably unimportant traits, stunts, personal traits, learned tricks and inept relationships of all such """"brilliant but eccentric"""" wiki subjects can point?

Thus the eccentricities (which, if not so important, are entertaining enough that folks will be motivated to search dilligently for evidence enough to warrant a smirk) can be acknowledged with a neat and proper cite through a proper point to another wikipedia page

but 

the """"eccentricities"""" page itself would be self-evidently immune from the precision of source usually required of biographies of thought, (by the way, why is it we assume that someone's date and place of birth is important to the formation of their intellectual ideas?) 

and would be a riotous read. (potentially Wiki's most commonly cited article)

This might satisfy both the """"biography of ideas"""" and the """"biography of real peoples behind the ideas"""" folks by allowing the hint or shadow of perhaps something utterly crazy to fall across the screen without an actual commission of the crime of citing one wack-o's account of another wack-o (non-traditional spelling intentional).

Paradoxically, this page might already exist, and merely lacks more """"slept with sheep but only within a platonic framework"""" entries in order to accumulate enough word-weight to produce a big enough ripple when it is dropped into the swimming pool of ideas. After all, it wouldn't probably be listed where any boring (and thus non-brilliant) person might expect. . .

Original article should be like this

 

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

Admin coaching
Well I checked you out, and you should be happy to know, I really don't take account age into consideration.  I'd be willing to take you on as a coachee, but there are 2 criteria.  1. You go up for RfA when I tell you your ready. 2. You disclose to me on or off wiki any other accounts you've had (I don't think you have, but I just feel the need for that rule.)  If you agree, your first lesson is to update the Admin coaching status page to reflect this.  Your second is to create a usersubpage User:Steve Crossin/AC and watchlist it.  I'll give you lessons there an what not.  Assuming everything works well, I'd say a late May, early June RfA would not be out of the question. ' talk

24 character article
Ok, so I did a quick format of the article, and started searching online for interviews with the actress. I have come up dry thus far, and was wondering if you have found anything.   

Specifically what article were you referring to? And, an admin has said I can use material from the 24 magazine.    

I was looking for those interviews, but I couldn't find them. I was trying to help with the Karen Hayes article.   

Ahh, the article on Miss Hayes P Hehe, I have a fair bit of info on her, and I can also now abuse the use of {{cite episode}}. A citation is a citation. Also, I know it hardly ever happens with TV shows, but what rating do you think the Nadia Yassir article would receive? That is, after the injunction is lifted.   

Definitely B, lots of references but needs to be more expansive for GA status and beyond. Once you gear up to do that, you could always post the references for Hayes that you find on her talk page, that way I could help out )   

Hehe, I could do that..and I think I will also work on trying to get Nadia Yassir to GA status. But my real goal? Getting Jack Bauer to featured article status. It would look quite good on an RFA. I'm gettng admin coaching. And also, I prefer bullets, so don't mind if I realign your comments on my talk page P   

That's fine, and good use of an old school laughing face, I love those. D Yeah, I added the little content there is to the Bauer article, good luck finding anything on how the character was created )  ([[User ta",0

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.

Sources to improve the article, and which tend to demonstrate notability, from the AFD:
Keep I originally speedily deleted the article because it was unreferenced and had WP:BLP issues due to unreferenced statements about Joe McCain's personal life in the first posted version. But the principle that relatives of politicians are not inherently notable certainly does not mean that they are inherently NON-notable. Also, I believe that the precedent of what has been kept and what has been deleted in AFD actually does provide guidance for future AFDs: We have kept several articles about relatives of world leaders or political candidates who are notable only as a result of their famous relative, but who have substantial coverage in multiple reliable and independent sources, thus satisfying WP:N. There is no requirement that this coverage be completely unrelated to the career of their politician relative. For Joe McCain, there are numerous article in newspapers over at least the past 37 years, long before McCain was a political candidate. There is coverage of Joe McCain sitting in a bamboo cage in Los Angeles, eating simulated POW food to dramatize the plight of POWs, as printed in The Independent (Long Beach, CA) Nov. 27, 1970. There is  """"In behalf of POWs, will ask 'doves' to sign petition"""" (Associated Press, December 31, 1970) as printed in Florence (SC) Morning News, Dec. 31, 1970, page 1 (via NewspaperArchive.com (subscription). This is a feature story about Joe McCain and two other brothers of POWs travelling around the US circulating petitions to be presented to North Vietnamese representatives.   There is a 86 word passage about him in """"Powerful Virginia Machine Digs In to Tackle McCain,"""" By Francis X. Clines, The New York Times, February 25, 2000. See """"MCCAIN WILL PRESS CAMPAIGN TO REFORM GOP, BROTHER SAYS"""" March 8, 2000, by Tom Ernst, The Buffalo News which has substantial coverage of Joe McCain, partly behind paywall. See """"Brother on Board; Joe McCain Isn't Steering the Campaign, But He's Proud to Be in the Back Seat"""" by Frank Ahrens,  The Washington Post,  February 3, 2000. which is certainly a story in a major newspaper devoted to Joe McCain. """"WORLD VIEWS: U.S. losing friends over torture"""" Edward M. Gomez, special to SF Gate (San Francisco Chronicle), November 15, 2005 has 126 words about Joe McCain on the Abu Ghraib torture scandal and his brother. """"Theater;Falling in Love With Love ;At GALA, Garcia Lorca's...""""

Say what?

I decide to check out the AfD articles, not something I normally get involved in. I come to an article for deletion, A Course in Miracles (book). I look over it  I see it's been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma. I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word, """"cult"""", that's being interpreted multiple ways. Multiple editors are squabbling over whether User:Ste4k is being """"POV"""" for using it. I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote, Garrett. I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job. I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change, citing the dictionary, etc. I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work, which you helpfully catch and fix.

I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article. I explain my reasoning, but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand. If I had, I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive; I think it's generally well written. At the same time, it screams out for about 200 {{fact}} tags. It's not clear to me how reliable it is. The book article, by contrast, is not as pretty and, as the principal author herself more or less says, reads like a U.S. District Court decision. There's a reason judges' decisions are not high literature and that's because they're shooting for reliability and precision, not memorable prose. There's considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article; there's even discussion as to whether the word """"movement"""" should be used. It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse (reliability), so I vote """"merge and delete"""" so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built.

Now I wake up and I find that you've spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article. It appears that one word, """"cult"""", and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy. That or my one vote in the AfD process. If you don't like my cult edit, just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong.

Then there's this message on my talk page:
""""I'm not originally from the U.S. I was born in Kharkov. In our country, we beat liars, and if one wants to eat, they work. The only POV in that article I wrote was that I wanted to find out the truth, did research, marked it with citations for verifiability, refused to consider any source that came from some primary provider, and all I found out for my trouble was that this encyclopedia isn't even worth quoting. You should be ashamed to have your familiy member's name on this medium.  """"

What do I make of this? Are you saying that I'm a liar and should (or would) be beaten? That I should be working harder to eat? And what's this about my family?

And as for Wikipedia, being flawed, it certainly is that. It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material. In fact, if so many millions of people didn't use it, I'd say forget about it. But the fact is, Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday. Every day, more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia. Every month, Wikipedia's Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search. The fact that so many other sites such as answers.com mirror the content makes what's written in Wikipedia seem all the more """"reliable"""" since to the undiscerning, it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia.

So like it or not, Wikipedia is here to stay and further grow in importance. You can fume and I can fret, but our children and grandchildren will use it more and more as their first source of knowledge, reliable or not. That almost pessimistic view of Wikipedia's growing role is what motivates me  not some idealistic, Woodstockian notion that """"information longs to be free"""" or so much of the other idealistic stuff that motivates thousands of mostly earnest, smart but very young editors on this project.

The information about his involvment comes from various news bits over the years, and mention of this album in discographies published by those who would know, like Niall Stokes.

The lead vocals are by Mick Jagger and The Chieftens.  Originally they were performed by Bono, but were not used.  These had been recorded at Windmill Lane.

How America Entered The War
Flynn Writes About The Diplomatic Secret Service  By F. W. Elven, Correspondent Of The München Latest
News  Cincinnati, Mid June
William J. Flynn has published a part of his War Memoirs in the weekly Liberty, which is much read here.
During the war, Flynn was the Head Of The United States Secret Service. The Service encompasses the whole
country, and is brilliantly organised. In peacetime it primarily provides for the personal security of the President.
Its attention is enjoyed by whatever else in the national capital is in need of protection, or thinks it needs so. It
keeps under surveillance all doubtful elements somehow suspected of connections with political tendencies
hostile to the government and its spokesmen. During the war its principal task was to keep an eye on those who
more or less loudly had made themselves noticeable in opposition to the war, or who merely were suspected of
not being in agreement with the Wilsonian war policy. Germans also enjoyed its special care, and at that time
many fell into the traps which had been laid everywhere by the Federal Secret Service.
From Flynn's memoirs, however, we learn that the Secret Service had been assigned an important mission even
before our entry into the war. In the year 1915, a full two years before the declaration of war, the most efficient
telephone expert was summoned to Washington and assigned the task of arranging the leading telephone wires
to the German and Austrian embassies in such a way that Secret Service officials could tap every conversation
from any source that was held between the ambassadors and their personnel, as well as every conversation
emanating from the embassy offices. A room was set up with which all the wires were linked in such an
ingenious way that not even a single conversation could be missed. Service men sat in this room day and night,
dictating the overheard conversations to the stenographers seated beside them. Every night the head of the Secret
Service Bureau, that is, the author of the article in Liberty, received a stenographic report of all the conversations
held in the preceding twenty four hours, so that on the very same evening he was able to communicate
everything important to the State Department and to President Wilson.
Let us bear in mind the time this installation was created, at the beginning of the year 1915, that is, at the time
when the United States still lived in peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and Wilson never tired of giving
assurances that he harboured no hostile intentions against Germany. It was also the time when the German
Ambassador in Washington, Count Bernstorff, neglected no opportunity to show due appreciation of Wilson's
friendly disposition and feelings for Germany and the German Folk. It was also the time when Wilson gave his
confidant Baruch instructions to begin the gradual mobilisation of industry for war; also the time in which it
became increasingly obvious, as the American historian Harry Elmer Barnes also sets forth in his book On The
Origins Of The Great War, that Wilson was firmly decided to enter the war, and postponed the execution of his
bellicose plans only because public opinion first had to be won over for these plans.
Flynn's memoirs must finally remove the ground from the foolish chatter that Wilson was pushed into the war
against his will by German submarine warfare. The tapping of the telephone wires leading to the German
embassy took place with his knowledge. We also learn this from Flynn's memoirs. The author adds that the
material thus gathered against Germany contributed considerably to the eventual break. This can prove only that
this put means in Wilson's hands to win public opinion for the war long planned by him. And in fact this
material was wholly and ideally suited for it. The Memoirs confirm to the fullest extent what unfortunately must
still be said, that Germany at that time was represented in Washington in a downright incredibly incompetent
and incredibly unworthy way. If we hear that in one passage Flynn writes that the stenographic reports prepared
for him daily contained enough material to keep a divorce lawyer busy for months on end, then we get a general
idea of what went on.
The Secret Service maintained women agents in Washington and New York whose job it was to sound out the
members of the German Embassy, Bernstorff included, whenever anything important happened. One of these
woman agents kept a better class apartment in Washington in which the gentlemen met their ladies, and where
occasionally even Secretary Of State Lansing dropped in to hear what was new. On New Year's Day, 1916,

"You are correct that I removed that reference (which I myself added before). This was however because it was no longer needed in the Fatherland party-article, seeing that I have now created a separate article for the international organisation in question, where all information is provided.

"""I say remove the sentence. Here's why, and I think my idea may be novel.  Yes, some said """"I hate Muslims.""""  However, we need to look at the context.  In the heat of a demonstration regarding a certain limited issue, they shouted """"I hate Muslims"""".  There is no evidence that they hate Muslims generally.  There are many, many Muslims in the world and all of them cannot be put into the little box that represented those involved in the demonstration.  So by putting what they shouted at a demonstration against a relatively limited few in the lead paragraph without proper contextualization, the implication is made that they hate all Muslims, not just those involved in the demonstration, and that would violate various Wiki policies.

"Are the creeds of Bible and Koran actually threats to others or could be interpreted as threats? Every rational man will understand that they are threats. It's so simple. If not, so how we interpret them and how we interpret every word and every thing? If I create a religion with creeds advocating killing all human beings (except the believes of this religion), would you think oppositions against this religion are personal attacks? I never attack any individual. I just want to fight against evil religion and evil creeds of evil religions. Disruptive comments? Are my comments disruptive, or the creeds of Bible and Koran disruptive? I would absolutely disagree to create a religion with faith that only the believers of this religion have privilege to go to heaven while others falling into hell. In my view, such religions are evil religions. Abrahamic religions are such kinds of religions. I cannot imagine a man or woman with conscience would support and believe in the Semitic one god religions.  -",0

"It does indeed look very awkward without images but the rules for WP:NFC explicitely state that: The use of non-free media in lists, galleries, discographies, and navigational and user-interface elements is usually unacceptable for failing the test for significance (criterion #8).

Addressing your suggestion, it is indeed possible to just revert the removal of the images but that won't deal with the source of the problem: the unacceptability of such act under Wikipedia policies, which in turn, stems from the US fair use and copyright laws. Unfortunately, there is very little I can do about the latter, so anyone who'd remove the images again will be formally right AND it will eventually lead to an edit war which is an unconditionally bad development.

"Me. I would be most grateful for including material on the medieval superbridge at Trezzo sull'Adda. Why? Because this bridge must have been amazing as it doubled the longest span of stone bridges then (from 37 to 72). Still, the briidge is almost unknown, as nobody covers the subject. 

There is also a claim that the Etruscans build very early on stone arch bridges (earlier than both Greeks and Romans). Two of them are included in Structurae, but I am not sure whether these are still the original structures. Including the Etruscans in a comprehensive history of stone arch bridges would definitely be an almost revolutionary thing.

"The definition for Fundamental Attribution Error that is in quotation marks may be bit too much for people unfamiliar with the terms/psychology that is included in the definition. I would maybe replace words like “attributor” and add examples after both “situational factors” and “dispositional factors”. (i.e., “situational factors such as luck,) 
Compared to the Fundamental Attribution Error definition that was provided in quotes, the one provided for attribution theory seems more simplistic and easy to follow, though “social perceiver” may have the same problem as “attributor” did like I mentioned above. Maybe for both definitions you could only use bits and pieces of the actual quotation and put the rest in your own words (i.e., change “social perceiver” -> “how an individual would be able to take in information ‘to explain events. 
Instead of a “in the real world” I would use to ‘one instance of this would be’ in order to have more of an “encyclopedic style”.
Using “their” instead of “his/her” before “personality” may be better as well, followed by “in which the individual is interacting” instead of “he/she is acting”. This would go well with the next section where “individual” and “their” is used in the place of “he/she” and “his/her”.

5 - Again - Kindly stop your misconduct and refrain from behaviour which is Bullying and Harassing.

It is interesting that in asking for much misconduct - misdirection - mendacity and twisting of wiki I am supposedly derailing in the view of  ? 

It is fascinating that he kept expanding the ANI entries under the heading [ A gross breach of WP:BLP at the 'Derby sex gang' article.] - To which he has added FOUR Subheadings and flooded the whole subject with yet more layers of misdirection, false and constructed claims all of which waste time and effort in having to address - and please not It Is NOt Possible To Prove The Negative.  

So he keeps adding to his misdirection - attempt to hide the questions of his failed conduct and confuse readers who were unwary of his patterns of misconduct - or even empower sympathetic ones to cherry pick. YET more Smoke An Mirrors. He evidently loves the attention it gains him. 

I fear that   has been happily misdirected by the ongoing misuse and manipulation of Wiki systems and content by  - as has also been revealed as part of his BLOCK which is featuring on ANI. 

I think that it needs to be reassessed - especially as the editor   has been focusing upon the ongoing claims of   under only a subheading created to claim that my responses and requests above were derailing so as to further 's pattern of misdirection and attack upon editors who are not gulled or beguiled by his (now revealed) well developed antics. 

I remain concerned that manipulation of content in this way is yet again being used to cause editors(Especially Admns)  to see what Manipulators wish and not the bigger picture. It is  a known pattern of exploitation of person/interface in the areas of Cyber Abuse-Harrassmnt-Bulying, and indicates that unwary editors(Especially Admns) are being made agents of the abusers.

 Ownership of articles 

Hi, this is Marxus, sorry, I don't know how to use those phrases and didn't know how to use them at all. I will try to now since you have told me. You see, I wrote many articles on Richard Brautigan novels such as A Confederate General From Big Sur, The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western, Willard and His Bowling Trophies: A Perverse Mystery, Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel, Dreaming of Babylon: A Private Eye Novel 1942, and An Unfortunate Woman: A Journey. For the novels The Hawkline Monster, Willard and His Bowling Trophies, Sombrero Fallout, and Dreaming of Babylon, I don't like when someone else changes what I have written. They create that thing on the right hand side of the novel pages about more information, I don't like that. Especially since there is no pictures on top it makes the article look bad. And I am sorry about the vandalism but I just want people changing my articles and when I change it back it goes back to the one I didn't like. I thank you for your information but please can you make that stop though and I am not trying to be rude or anything I am just asking my articles to be the way I would like them is all. Thank you and please respond.

Please note that you do not own any article; no article on Wikipedia is your article, even if you created it and are the only person who has edited it. So let me strongly suggest that you step back and think before using the phrase """"my article"""" again. Trying to justify your vandalism on the basis that someone does something that you don't like is about the weakest excuse possible.

"""power versus energy
Good article, very well cited.  [User:Dick Mills]

While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. 

The openening sentences which say, """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year."""" should be changed to """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.""""   

Similarly, the labels on the the graphs should be changed. 

Unfortunately, the association of consumption with power (watts) continues throughout the article.  Again, """"The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%."""" is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. 

Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  

It will take a major rewrite to correct this article.  Both the nomenclature and the numbers need to be checked.

 This info is all messed up !! 

Pit bull is a slang term that describes several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics. There are several physically similar breeds that are often termed """"pit bull"""", including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the Perro de Presa Canario, Cane Corso, and Argentine Dogos.These breeds are usually not included by name in any Breed Specific Legislation (see below), but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is. [1] All of these breeds as well as many others (including Great Danes, Newfoundlands and Rottweilers) are members of the Molosser family of dog breeds.

1: Pitbull is NOT a slang , its just one of the nicknames och shortened names the breed has had during the years.
Those that use it for dogs other then Pitbulls are just ignorant and dont have the facts surrounding the breed clear to them.
often used by journalists and people without any background info
Its a pure breed dog , registered under UKC since 1898. its beeing registered under """"American pitbull Terrier"""" under a few more registrys such as ADBA & BFKC in USA.

I dont know why this site, that is set to be some kind of """"kowledge base"""" allows itself to have this info at the top of the page.
All it does, is to confuse people that come in here to read and to find out more about the breed.

If this is the first thing a visitor reads , then it often sticks to his/her mind as """"truth"""" and he leaves the site.
If a reader comes in here to search facts because he/her is unsure about what a Pitbull is because of medias coverage, then this info just confirmes to him/her that there is no such thing as a real Pitbull, with is as far from the truth you may come.
There are so many myths and hearsays around this breed , so i suggest the top info to be rewritten and only contain FACTS.

Many countries have their own Kennelclubs , and they are all tied together by FCI as an international organ.
But FCI only works with 1 kennelclub per country and if a dog aint listed in that club , other countries follow FCI regulations and do the same.
This is why FCI dossent recognize the Pitbull as a pure breed.
They work with AKC (American Kennel Club) that dossent keep register of the Pitbull , But the American Staffordshire Terrier.
Pitbulls as i said erlier,  was first registered with UKC (United Kennel Club) and because only one club per country is allowed in FIC regulations the Pitbull was left outside due to a tecnicality.

This is the same in several countries.
The national kennelclubs is tied to follow FCI regulations if they are members , and thats why Sweden for example dossent recognize the pitbull in their own kennel klub (SKK).

Why did i say all this then ?
Well , it goes back to what i wrote erlier.
If a person think that Pitbull just is a """"slang"""" and not a pure breed as written at top of Wikipedia site about pitbulls , and lives in Sweden for example , then this sites info add more to the myths.

So if a moderator reads this , please think hard about what signals the top text about Pitbulls sends out to this pages viewers.

 Answer from Falun Gong talk page 

Katsam, Im a Falun Gong practitioner, if youd like to listen to what i have to say, i can answer your questions briefly from our point of view. Many people see Falun Gong in different ways, some criticize it and some other people practice it, youll hear many things from many people but in the end its up to you to make up your mind about it. Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a cultivation system of mind and body, there are the 5 sets of excercises to practice and there are the books for reading which contain the teachings of Mr. Li. 
The purpose of our practice is to assimilate to the principles of """"Truth Benevolence Forbearance"""" and letting go of attatchments, all this is substantiated by the practice of the excercises which provides you with gong, gradually cleans your body and evolves many things for you. A religion can be a cultivation system but not necessarily a cultivation system has to be a religion, so Falun Gong is in no way a religion of some sort, we dont pray or worship any gods at all and there are no """"churches"""" or enrollment sistems, people practice voluntarily and you can start or stop whenever you want. 

You can practice wherever and whenever you want and as long as you want, There are practice sites where you can go if youd like to share your practice and time with other practitioners too. There are no ranks in falun gong, there is an assistant who teaches the excercises to new people and coordinates the group practice. Mr. Li is often reffered to as the """"master"""" by the students because of respect but he never asked to be called this way.

According to our point of view, to be practitioner is to be a person who wants to be better everyday and who wants to improve himself in all the aspects of his life but as you may have noticed, not everyone is perfect and we can all make mistakes during the process of cultivation, everyone has their own attatchments and personal problems that they have to overcome but with patience i think anything can be achieved, so this is why some people feel compelled to practice it more than other types of Qigong.

About the persecution, our point of view on the matter is that there came to be so many falun gong practitioners in China that the government decided to """"supress"""" them in order to prevent that the Chinese people would start following principles different from the Chinese Comunist ideology. Supression or persecution, however its called, something is happening. Some other people may deny it, the government might say there is nothing going on but we believe its very clear that there is something going on. You can identify the practitioners at the practice sites while they do the excercises or you can just ask, true FG practitioners dont lie, if they dont want to say something, perhaps they wont say it, but whatever they say must be true, thats the way it should be. But i wonder now, how can you supress this practice by just telling people not to do it? we think there is something beyond that, which is torture. If you want to legally forbid something, you have to have a reason for it, so if you dont have it, you come up with it.

Everything i just said is the FG practitioners point of view on the matter and in no way it represents the opinion of everyone present on this talk page, perhaps later on you might listen to the critics point of view, again all i can say is that its up to you to make up your mind about it. If youd like to see some pictures or know more about the practice from the practitioners point of view, you can go to this webpage www.falundafa.com  """,0

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

The word 'titbit' carries no offence whatesoever in the UK and 'Titbits' was the name of a general interest UK magazine for many years.

'Tits' is only a very mild and slightly comical expletive in UK use. The word 'piss' is more vulgar but can be found in the Bible. It might be heard in the matey environment of a pub, such as """"Joe has gone for a piss"""".

Obviously, it appeared inappropriate to you, or you would have left it.  The fact is, that if my articles needed fixing, amending or deleting, other competent editors are capable of doing so.  You might think that your BOLD stance and following me around makes you a good editor, I submit that it is hounding.

I have edited Wikipedia in the past, but I am a busy man.  Being CEO of a company and president of another doesn't leave a lot of time for going tit-for-tat with people like you.  I can only assume that you don't have a lot of pressing issues.  At any rate, I recommend you recuse yourself from my articles and issues and let other people deal with them if they see fit.  As it stands, you have made editing here unpleasant for me and appear to be going out of your way to undermine me and my organization. (both of which are criteria for wikihounding)

I can't imagine why you would have such animosity for a person who spends the majority of his time helping people for no remuneration.  The articles in question are not self-promotion... we just don't hire people to do this kind of thing like some other charity organisations.  It seems only logical to me that if our contemporaries in hydrophilanthropy and their CEO's warrant articles, than our organization does as well. If there are things that could be improved I am sure some people other than yourself are capable of helping out in that regard.

You say it only takes 2 independent reliable sources?  Well, there are dozens of them, and they are not hard to find, so if you were truly being impartial of your research into Water Charity and myself, you would have found more than enough yourself.  I am guessing the Washington Post, the LA Times, and other news agencies from London to Hong Kong, the AP, Reuters and more are reliable enough. If helping a million people doesn't make us notable, what does?  You do realize that water related illness kills more people than all forms of violence put together... including war.  And yet, there are Wiki pages for military officers who have only appeared in the media a couple of times that you don't seem to see fit to subject to your scrutiny.

I really don't have the time or energy to do this with you though.  If you withdraw your aggressive editing of my posts and go on about your business, I guarantee you that someone else will see what you seem to have seen and take up the torch... if you were right.  I would be happy to learn more about how to do all of this correctly and make my edits and articles better.

These lessons will have to wait anyway, as I have real work to do.

Should you continue to make me a priority the way you have, I will take this to the appropriate venue for harassment complaints and let them decide.  Erasing me from your TODO list will not cover up what was posted here.  If you retract your attacks, we can erase this entire back and forth and go on about our respective businesses.

Some Wikipedia editors have proposed that Wikipedia article content should be in proportion to article count. In other words, if there are 5 articles about Suburban Express about history, competitive battles, etc., and 20 """"articles"""" (blog posts, mostly) about the recent newsy trash that 80% of the article should relate to the recent newsy trash. One big problem with that is the fact that many of the blog articles are simply regurgitated from one seminal article or two. In other words, if there are 20 blog articles, there may be 18 that are essentially copied from the initial two. If the body count method of assigning weight is accepted, duplicate/regurgitated articles should probably be ignored.

"Thanks for getting back so quickly. That makes sense to me – no worries, and glad you approve of the rest of the article. However, I'm wondering if you're aware of the fact that there are some stringent policies about conflicts of interest on Wikipedia, to ensure that articles reflect a neutral point of view. You might like to read through Wikipedia:Conflict of interest, which gives you a run-down of this whole area. The aim is to try to maintain the encyclopaedic nature of Wikipedia, and ensure it doesn't get used for advertising or biased opinions.

The reason I asked about a reference was because of the policy outlined in Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons – there are no particular problems with your statement about the book in this article, but in general all statements in articles about living people need to be verifiable via citations to reliable published sources. This protects people like you from unfounded statements and rumours that could otherwise appear in your article (since everyone can edit Wikipedia).

Tango: There are infinitely many numbers between 0.999... and 1 - check the archives and you will find a clear example. You are incorrectly assuming that the limit of a series determines a number. If you insist on defining a number by a series (in fact this is circular), you must be consistent: what is the limit of any irrational number defined as a Cauchy sequence? You do not know, therefore you cannot use this definition. Furthermore, the apparatus for comparing numbers in decimal form must be consistent. You start wih the most significant digit in the representation and continue the comparison until you find two digits that are not equal. Having 0.999... = 1, contradicts this method. You must also remember that it is impossible to represent all numbers in any radix system. Most numbers can only be approximated.

This is how I would propose to lay out material on a subclass of semirings, in this case complete star semirings.  Firstly, define complete semirings and star semirings, each with a set of examples  Finally define complete star semirings, again with a set of examples.   In this case continuous semirings are closely related to complete semirings, so it makes sense to include them: an additional motivation here is that this emphasises the relationship between partial orders defined on the semirings and the star structure: for example, Conway uses the order approach to prove Kleene's theorem in his 1971 book.  Of course there are choices here.  For example, should the examples of complete star semirings be introduced early on, or only after the last definition?  There's no right answer to that.  I would like to see examples of a concept which are not examples of the richer structure, folloewd by examples of the richer structure.  Examples of continuous semirings would have been helpful, but as some editors have said, there is no deadline.  In my view, a definition without an example is hugely preferable to no definition at all: the reader in search of information will still be able to see what sort of thing it is and find references to further resources on the subject.  That, it seems to me, is what an encyclopaedia is for.
The current state of the material seems to me to be intended to do one thing only, which is to introduce complete star semirings in a way which makes the star operation as close as possible to the traditional Kleene star.  This is not the only approach.  A reason for the axiomatisation and separation out of the various properties is the entirely reasonable mathematical activity of finding out which of the properties of the Kleene star derive from what assumptions.  On the way, various structures of interest emerge, and various theorems are proved about the relationships between them.  That may not suit the point of view that star semirings are """"really"""" or """"completely unsurprisingly"""" the original formal languages: but that's only a point of view; it isn't correct, or at least, isn't the whole truth; and it isn't helpful to the reader of the encyclopaedia.

You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments.

Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas.  Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, """"beat generation"""" means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle.

If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an """"excellent and practical solution"""" because it's not an actual change  which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article.

"Thanks 

A short note of thanks for the explanation (the first cogent one I've seen) and statesman like manner of handling these issues. Your concern for wiki comes through and having allowed a little time to pass and having reread your note a few times I realise my support for the underlying concept of wiki is undiminished. There seems to be no concern about uploaded images and I'll take that advice about links and propose them on the article discussion page (maybe those that are externally approved as educational resources would be appropriate suggestions) and leave it the wiki community to take it from there. Not sure how future reviewers recognise that links have been added legitimately in this way eg the Brookwood Cemetery link which has been through this process and removed again and reinstated again! But maybe a step at a time. Thanks",0

"Missing the Forest... 

I just have to add a comment to this talk page, in light of the ongoing struggle over administrator priviledge and userboxes.  I try hard to assume good faith, and I certainly would like to have the same assumed of my actions.  Having contributed a number of userboxes, and finding them deleted without notice, I was confused.  Upon digging deeper, I saw that the problem was much more serious that a few templates being deleted out of process.  There are a number of admins that seem to think that they have the right to dictate to the masses what is and is not acceptable content in the user space.  This is wrong.  User space is where wikipedians are allowed to express their POV, personal convictions, and interests.  Admins do have a responsibility to wikipedia, but first and foremost it should be recognized that wikipedia only exists because of wikipedians.  Actions such as mass purges, mass deletions, and mass edits without explanation, are basically the most disruptive possible avenue available.  In the grand scheme of things, userboxes are basically unimportant, but they have become the most critical issue on the wikipedia at present because they have been attacked by administrators without comment or explanation, outside of process, and with no regard for the impact this has on the community.  I am unhappy with your part in this, Tony, and I expected better.  I feel that admins should learn from their mistakes, and the mistakes of others, but I am afraid I see these being repeated.  If you feel you have the right, then you are welcome to exercise it - but you will destroy the wikipedia if you destroy the desire of wikipedians to participate.

"If you read the Oohashi paper, you will see the trouble they have gone to, to source ultrasonic music from gamelans, special playback equipment, special tweeters, etc .... everything checked from source to speaker system. Meyer Moran does not even seek to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not pretend to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not claim to be a test of ultrasonics. If you wish to assert that Meyer Moran is a test of ultrasonics, you will have to formally prove that EACH AND EVERY ONE of the elements of the chain passes the ultrasonic test. So let's check it out

1. Source material:  

This is discusssed at:  
http://www.sa-cd.net/showthread.php?page=1
It turns out that the vast majority of source discs used by Meyer Moran were recorded in the 50s, 60, 70s or 80s ... they are CD quality masters, and therefore do not have ultrasonic content.  
Summary: SOURCE MATERIAL:   FAILS ultrasonic test

2. The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran has to be able to reproduce ultrasonics. 
The source equipment used by Meyer Moran is listed at:
http://www.bostonaudiosociety.org/explanation.htm
The principal equipment consisted of an Adcom GTP-450 preamp and Snell C/V speakers.

You can find the specs for the Adcom GTP-450 preamp here:

http://www.users.interport.net/a/d/adcom/gtp450.html

The specs are listed as: 20Hz to 20kHz.  FAILS ultrasonic test

The specs for the Snell C/V speakers are given here:

http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/1194snell/index3.html

They show massive drop-off above 22 kHz. FAIL

Summary:  The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran cannot reproduce ultrasonics properly.

GRAND SUMMARY:  Meyer Moran is not a test of ultrasonics. Meyer Moran do not claim it is a test of ultrasonics. The only person claiming that it is a test of ultrasonics is you, it is  your own original research, which is a violation of the Wiki original research provisions. Worse, your claim is  completely flawed and erroneous, at EVERY LEVEL of the chain, from source material through to speakers.

I'll leave this up for a day or so for some discussion. If you cannot prove your original claims, then ... out it goes.

P.S. Your Lehrman (2008) reference is just a quote of Meyer Moran - it also has absolutely nothing to do with hypersonic, or ultrasonics. You might want to take this to the CD advocacy page - but it has nothing to do with the ultrasonic effect. Out it goes. (  )",0

"Incompleteness 
As I heard the story of the Carson City Mint, it started life as a private operation, because the US Treasury refused to build a branch to accommodate the Comstock Lode.  When the government attempted to close it down and prosecute the operators for counterfeiting, the prosecution was defeated by the detail that the dollar coins were fractionally overweight.  The street price of silver in Carson City was low enough to still permit a profit on the minting. Thus, unable to prevent the minting of silver coins in Carson City, the Treasury took over operations and pocketed the fractional overweight.  Even if this story is inaccurate, I believe the story ought to be included, perhaps with its disproof, but it does shed light on the issue of the discrepancy between the value of silver as a commodity and as currency.",0

 Unprotected 
I'm going to edit based on my comments in Talk:New_anti-Semitism#Sourcing_claims_for_.22Country-specific_incidents so could we discuss them now?  

All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-Semitism i.e. coming from the left, related to radical anti-Zionism etc.  (talk) 

They may well be, but they are not sourced that way.  

I don't think we can expect the words """"new anti-Semitism"""" to appear in every single report we reference. We've defined it, and we've linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:

It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the """"new anti-Semitism."""" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.

All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) 

My worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I'd just want to tidy that up.  

Livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  (talk) 

Slim, whose definition is this?   

All the sources put together. The above are the issues they agree on. It was posted weeks ago.  (talk) 

I think you mean """"all the sources from one side of the argument put together"""".  It's been a while since we discussed this, so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative?   
Sorry, you'll have to look in the archives; they're either there or in the article. By """"all the sources,"""" I mean all the sources who study new anti-Semitism. The above are the elements they appear to agree on.  (talk) 
I'm asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative.  Please respond.  [[User:C",0

Reply: I added another, different, quotation from the same article that helps firm up how Russell felt on the subject. I  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation; it makes it more conclusive. 

My statement that Russell never suggested organized prohibition on using blood represents the conclusion of a Modus Tollens argument. However, rather than speculating about what Russell did or did not suggest, my statement should have read that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. 

Modus Tollens would have us accept that had Russell, as president of the Watchtower organization, organized a prohibition on using blood among his followers then we would have seen organized prohibition on using blood among his followers. Since there is no record of such an organized prohibition among Russell’s fellow worshippers then the Modus Tollens argument form has us conclude that Russell never organized it. The underlying premises of this particular argument are 1) that Russell applied his presidency and that 2) his fellow worshippers acted on his presidential initiatives. There is ample evidence that Russell applied his presidency, and that his fellows acted on it. Hence, it is not my opinion that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. Rather, it is a logical end to a valid argument form based on evidenced premises. 

For the time being I have removed the statement about Russell and organized prohibition on blood under his presidency. If you dispute the validity of what I write above then please offer logical refutation, keeping in mind that logical constructions and conclusions are not at the mercy of preferential outcomes (i.e., private opinion). I make the latter comment only to demonstrate my commitment to logical conclusions is above my commitment to any personal opinions I may presently hold. If you fail to offer refutation within a reasonable time then I will return my comment to the history section, but in a more precise form.",0

Not to mention, your block came after a warning, after which he didn't edit that or any other article. I personally invited him to WikiProject Pornography after seeing his sandbox. Regards,  
Since all that user's edits were obvious vandalism, including the sandbox, and the username further suggests an intention not to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, this was a routine block (the kind that the template  is regularly used to deal with). Regards,   (Edgar181) 
O.K, but don't you need to give a user a last warning before you block him/her? Not to mention, in sandbox a user have a right to write what he wants as long as he is not attacking anyone and it doesn't get out.  
There is no requirement in the blocking policy for a """"last warning"""" before a user can be blocked. And there are other types of inappropriate content in a user's sandbox than just attacks on other users (and it doesn't matter if it """"gets out"""" or not either).    (Edgar181)

 Article Feedback Tool update 

Hey Edgar181. I'm contacting you because you're involved in the Article Feedback Tool in some way, either as a previous newsletter recipient or as an active user of the system. As you might have heard, a user recently anonymously disabled the feedback tool on 2,000 pages.  We were unable to track or prevent this due to the lack of logging feature in AFT5.  We're deeply sorry for this, as we know that quite a few users found the software very useful, and were using it on their articles.

We've now re-released the software, with the addition of a logging feature and restrictions on the ability to disable. Obviously, we're not going to automatically re-enable it on each article—we don't want to create a situation where it was enabled by users who have now moved on, and feedback would sit there unattended—but if you're interested in enabling it for your articles, it's pretty simple to do. Just go to the article you want to enable it on, click the """"request feedback"""" link in the toolbox in the sidebar, and AFT5 will be enabled for that article.

Again, we're very sorry about this issue; hopefully it'll be smooth sailing after this ). If you have any questions, just drop them at the talkpage. Thanks!

"The CIA and the US government historically have admitted that Mexicans are white when they do the census. I 
 I am curious, the CIA fact book states that the USA is 81.7% white 12.9% black, 4.2% Asian, and 2% others? This adds up to about 100%, what happened to all the Mexicans, and Hispanics? Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%? According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA?

 Challenge/Response and Backscatter 

One anti-spam proposal has been the challenge/response type of system, which sends challenge messages to unknown senders of incoming mail and awaits a response before delivering a message.  Such systems are generally declared as failures and backscatter is the reason.  Concerning a legitimate message, the challenge would typically be sent to the sender.  However, for spam, this is often a forged address, so such a challenge """"raises the noise floor"""" for its innocent recipient.  Although such a recipient will fail to reply, thus causing the originating spam to be discarded, one is effectively placing the decision into the hands of an unknown third party, who is annoyed by the unsolicited challenge message.

Furthermore, for a challenge to be useful, it must somehow refer to the original message sent, and even include a (partial) copy of such.  When a C/R system does so, effectively it becomes a spam relay.  A spammer, knowing that a certain C/R system includes a copy, will design his message so that the spam payload is among the copied portion, and forge his desired recipient's address as if he were the sender, thus allowing the C/R system to be the actual delivering server of the spam (as a challenge message payload) to his desired target.

The definition of backscatter as used by some individuals very well includes such challenges from C/R systems, especially those which can be tricked by spammers to deliver their message payloads.  Such challenges are not technically """"bounce messages"""" as they are not NDRs but otherwise satisfy all the other common requirements to be considered backscatter (if not spam in its own right).

Narayana Guru and Atheism

I disagree with the text in this section. Associating Narayana Guru with atheism clearly shows the lack of knowledge of the originating author on the Guru's philosophical and metaphysical works and perspective and reasoning of the Universe. Proclaimed atheists being associated with an individual in social reform initiatives does not by itself make the individual an atheist.

Also there is a clear distinction between rationalists and atheists.

Narayana Guru and Sahodran Ayyappan

Narayana Guru had disagreed with Sahodaran Ayyappan when the latter tried to corrupt Guru's teachings with Atheism.In fact Ayyappan requested Guru's permission to modify the slogan  'Oru Jati , Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu' as 'Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda'. However, Guru ridiculed him by asking """" If Ayyappan wants to collect Rs.1 from each person to set up a library,  you will ask ' Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee,Give One Rupee'. Does that mean ' No Rupee,No Rupee,No Rupee """" ?

This 'Sahodaran' kept quiet at that time.However, he renewed his Atheist activities after the samadhi of Guru, thereby corrupting Guru's ideology. Vested interests fully exploited this confusion to corrupt Guru's teachings by projecting this 'Sahodaran' even above Guru.

Clarification on Atheism

No where in the article did I say that Naryanaguru was an atheist. What I wrote was “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent” and that many of his followers had considered him an atheist.  Can somebody point out which sentence of the article gives such an impression that he was an atheist?  It goes to the credit of Sri Narayanaguru that in spite of being a theist, he openly accepted even atheists as his core desciples. The importance of this can be guaged only if one consideres the period in which he lived.

One also has to be clear about the kind of thiesm Narayana Guru adovocated. It definitely was not the one associated with the brahaminical/casteist Hiduism.

I find it bit difficult to comprehend why this section on atheism and atheist followers of Narayanaguru should be edited out.  A discussion/debate on the philosophy of Narayanaguru is thoroughly understandable but I find it puzzling that the followers of Narayanaguru are getting overly agitated on hearing the word atheism. Pity indeed! 

And I agree with Aaroamal that there is a distintion between rationalist and atheist. That is precisely why I assert in my user page of wikipedia that I am both an atheist and rationalist.

 Clarification on Atheism 

Manoj, True, you did not explicitly write that Narayana Guru was an atheist. However, you implicitly structured a (misinformed and incomplete) statement as follows:

 “When Sahodaran Ayyappan modified Narayana Guru's famous catchphrase, Oru Jati, Oru Matham, Oru Daivam Manushyanu (One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanbeing) and re-written it as Jati Venda, Matham Venda, Daivam Venda Manushyanu…the latter did not protest”. 

Obviously by stating that “…the latter did not protest”, here you are clearly implying that Narayana Guru accepted Sahodaran Ayyappan’s atheistic view as amendment to the famous catchphrase. I am sorry to say that this is absolutely false!

Everybody appreciates that Narayana Guru was tolerant of atheists because he respected an individual’s fundamental right and freedom to belief, or disbelief, in the exitence of God. That tolerant attitude however should not be misinterpreted to imply otherwise.

As Krishnan has already pointed out, Narayana Guru’s reaction to Sahodaran Ayyappan’s revised version of the slogan was a clear protest, so it is not true to say …”the latter did not protest”.

Please could you explain what you mean by saying, “his attitude towards the existence of a personal god is considered quite ambivalent”; are you referring to any of Narayana Guru’s writings, if so which one? Which serious scholar of Narayana Guru has so commented? Also, in what context is that statement being included under the heading “Narayana Guru and Atheism”.

OMG, you are an imbecile.  Seriously.  

Let's go over this one last time on the remote chance you might finally understand the difference between fact and opinion.

I rewrote the contribution using ONLY information that I found on the Internet that supported the contribution.  I did not add anything to the story that could not be verified through a reliable source.  YOU, on the other hand, wrote a contribution that DID add content to the story that could NOT be verified through a reliable source, making it YOUR OPINION.  You said things like  """"... when a neighboring police agency was needed and requested by the chief of police to intervene in the criminal conduct of Arvada's police force.""""

This is libelous, because you accuse the Arvada Police Department of """"criminal conduct"""" when no criminal conduct has been proven in a court of law.  Even the officer who is alleged to have done the hitting has been found """"not guilty"""" by your peers. Because no one is convicted in the link you provide (or ANY link ANYWHERE on the Internet), it is your OPINION.  If you had used the phrase """"ALLEGED criminal conduct"""" you would be more on track.

You also wrote: """"Arvada's city council had chosen not to intervene in the previous criminal conduct of several members of the Arvada police, despite a cost to the city of close to half a million dollars defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone, during a period of budget crises.""""

The """"close to half a million dollars"""" was NOT spent """"defending the criminal actions of one police officer alone.""""  The money was spent settling OUT OF COURT so that the accusations had no opportunity to be proven as fact.  A """"criminal"""" is someone who has been CONVICTED of a crime. So there cannot be """"criminal actions"""" unless someone has been convicted of a crime.  There CAN be """"alleged questionable actions,"""" which is what you should have written. 

When you post hateful things about others that is just your opinion, that opens you up to a LIBEL SUIT.  If you do it in a blog, and you make it clear that you are expressing your opinion and not facts, you can say whatever you like there without much fear of libel.  But when you post to a site whose premise is encyclopedic content, you cannot just post what you THINK.  You must post what can be VERIFIED.   Do you understand this very basic principle?  Please read it again if you don't, because I'm done trying to educate you.

Definition of libel (I encourage you to visit the link and read all its contents):  http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-libel.htm

Libel involves false statements knowingly presented as fact. In the United States opinion is protected as a tenant of freedom of speech, falling outside the purview of libel. Citizens retain the right to comment on public figures and entities, including government and officials. Entertainment, parody, editorials and criticisms that may arguably misrepresent facts are not libelous so long as they are presented for amusement or stated as mere opinion. 

From:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation

How to prove libel:  There are several ways a person must go about proving that libel has taken place. For example, in the United States, the person first must prove that the statement was false. Second, that person must prove that the statement caused harm. And, third, they must prove that the statement was made without adequate research into the truthfulness of the statement. These steps are for an ordinary citizen.

Hi, n2e. It's great to have someone with an econ background looking at the Suburban Express article. You've proposed some sensible changes. But, as you can see, CorpM has a very strong point of view. The Suburban Express story is about a 19 year old kid who attacked incumbent Greyhound, decreased fares, increased frequency, and decreased travel times and then weathered attacks based on regulatory capture, predatory pricing, and (not covered in any press) harrassment by the Chicago Transit Authority, which leased space to Greyhound. It is novel in that S.E. sidestepped economic regulation which was designed to ensure legacy carriers (greyhound, et al) a fair return on their investment but which had morphed into a system that supported inefficiency, high fares, and lousy service. Since you teach, I imagine you can appreciate the issues we have with students trying to get what they want, regardless of the agreement they have with us. 

e have battled all sorts of fraud during the course of our history - people making fake tickets, tons of bad checks, people passing their receipt out the bathroom window to a friend who then tells driver he is getting back on, and so forth. Fraud has lead to collection action of various forms, and it recently got some negative press because a small handful of nasty little assholes decided to devote their lives to trashing us. Their actions have not impacted ridership, but they have frustrated my employees and I by trashing us online wherever they get the chance. My instincts tell me that the user who is most committed to injecting POV into the article was contacted by one of the haters, who works in PR for the university and has contacts in that world. 

The supposed """"controversy"""" is a mish-mash of different issues that the haters are promoting, all rolled into one: 1) we filed 100ish small claims suits in a short period of time. the number was unusual because we had about a 2 year backlog of debts to collect; 2) A subcontracted driver was rude to a student who does not speak english. He was promptly reprimanded and we sought to apologize to the passenger, but did not succeed in identifying her. A loudmouth narcissistic attention seeking student who was on the bus posted the story to facebook from the bus and spent every waking moment posting the story everywhere he could. 3) This led to a situation on Reddit where the loudmouth and his friends were trashing S.E. as best they could and the moderator started manipulating the conversation, by deleting comments made in support of S.E. That got out of hand and our attorney sent a demand letter to the moderator. The moderator then exploited free-speech bloggers and caused the BIG STORY to spread. Self-interest came into play - Reddit is owned by conde nast. Reddit benefits from awareness of reddit. Reddit can only exist if users are free to say whatever they want. Conde Nast also owns Ars Technica. Ars Technica wrote several blog posts about how horrible SE is for trying to suppress free speech on reddit. See how this works? Downstream lower-quality blogs regurgitated the free-speech story.

Two of the haters, now armed with SOURCES, took to Wikipedia and transformed this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suburban_Express&oldid;=542659074 into a very skewed mess. Then the problem became recursive - bloggers mentioned wikipedia, which led readers to trash the wikipedia page even more. Wiki editors cited the articles that cited wikipedia and the list of blogs that had covered the matter grew and grew. Now, the haters assert that the body of trash-news justifies giving the trash significant weight in the article - to the point where the real story of the company is pushed out. You can see this in corpm's proposed edit. He wants to remove from the lede the fact that the company was started by a student, and other key facts.

In any event, I applaud your efforts to move the article in a more academic direction, and I'm glad that someone with an econ background has arrived on-scene. You may find some stuff here interesting: http://www.toeppen.com

 I think the general idea initially was to change how the company is described wholesale, including in the lead, to a """"taxi dispatch service"""" from a """"ridesharing service"""".  There doesn't appear to be consensus for this because most RS do not describe Uber that way.  
Based on our discussion so far, what I'm suggesting is that 
we leave the lead alone and maintain the """"ridesharing service"""" description, and 
 under the 2012-present section of History, that we describe that Uber implemented an option in their app  called Uber Taxi that dispatches actual taxis drivers to customers, and that it has been implemented in multiple cities.   
So, if folks want to support or oppose that idea, please indicate that below so we can start gathering a consensus on the matter.   drop me a line """,0

"Alison:

I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN )

Aaahhh ... the Wiki word of 'majick:' consensus. 'N then inspiring usages as: '... balanced discussions moving towards consensus.' With respect, KieferSkunk, you're indulging in some smoke with mirrors 'n handwaving. Since, whenever, has 'consensus' been some sort of guarantee of guidance towards ... what IS? (True/just ... etc. etc.) I'd bet that, on history's scale, 'consensus' is a miserable failure. The 'Triangle Trade' was a matter of 'community consensus' among those who participated, as was the Holocaust. But, anyway, that it is a comforting fiction of human understanding is neither here nor there. It's, well, what can I say, sooo subjective ... and thus by Wiki's own 'standards' unencyclopaedic. Grudging acceptance maybe ;-)

The idea of 'consensus' as being an aspect of 'mediocrity,' a kind of 'dumbing down' is featured in a recent R4 docu. on Wiki:

"Some personal observations here: 
Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  

I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   23:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)",0

No doubt footnote no.1 correctly ascribes the information on the map to the WHO but clearly the WHO is not the appropriate authority given that the UN as we all know deals with countries' self-reporting. May I point out that Malaysia and Indonesia, which are described as Muslim countries (as they officially indeed are), contain very substantial Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities. (See the CIA World Fact Book .) Moreover, many such minorities are considerably to be identified by region. North Borneo and New Guinea, for example, are very large geographical areas in Malaysia and Indonesia which only have a marginal Muslim presence; the Moluccas in Indonesia are at least 50% Christian; Bali is famously Hindu. Overall, Malaysia is some 60% Muslim and clearly does not belong in the plus-80% circumcised category as it appears on the map. But given the geographical spread of these countries and vast disparity of cultures and religions across the Indonesian Archipelago, it is surely meaningless to describe these countries in such a way.

I essentially replaced the wording, eliminating """"most"""" from """"most widely."""" Jayjg reverted, but I'm going to put it in again absent a good argument against doing this. Maimonides' version clearly is widely used  Wikipedia's own article on the 613 mitzvot includes Maimonides' list as its only example, and describes Maimonides' work that included the list as """"The most important of the above works"""" from a list of works that include versions of the list. It is also the only version that I have seen reproduced anywhere online. While Jay claims that the absence of aliyah from Maimonides' list should not be mentioned because virtually every other list includes it, that is not logical if Maimonides' list is """"the most important"""" of the lists; it is essentially original research for Jay to conclude that the singularity of the absence of aliyah to Maimonides' list makes it not worth mentioning.

It would make sense (in fact, when I replace the wording, I'll do it myself) to note that Maimonides' other writings tend to contradict the omission, but that does not necessarily nor, I think, in fact warrant suppressing the note about the """"most important"""" of the mitzvot lists being the exception to the statement in the article.
Jay describes the clarification as """"uncited POV,"""" which may be true regarding """"most widely,"""" which I eliminated, but not """"widely,"""" nor anything else about the clarification. It is also highly selective, clearly, not to note that the exception to including aliyah in the mitzvot comes from perhaps the most important of the versions.

 The article is incomplete 

Well written and interesting. Good.

I think the article would benefit from identifying the former bands of the members. What I find frustrating is that the article seems to assume knowledge of UK indie music. Why is it a supergroup? Who is Damon Albarn? Paul Simonon? Tony Allen? Simon Tong? I knew Damon, but I had to click 3 more links to find out the others. As an international wiki, anyone outside the UK will have no idea who these people are. The article should explain to anyone assuming no prior knowledge. Mention and link to the Clash, the Verve, Blur etc as well. 

After all, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia. It's not an article in NME, and space isn't an issue. Identifying the history of the members and explaining why it was considered a """"supergroup"""" is surely relevant to the article.

On another note - I only noticed who produced the album was here when I returned to it and looked at the top right side panel. I was expecting to find this at the bottom under the list of personnel. On my first visit I had to click other links to be certain that Danger Mouse had done it.

Hope that didn't sound too much of a complaint.

 WP:AFC on Marathonios 

Note: The following post by an IP about Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus Marathonios has been copied here from User talk:EdJohnston/Anontalk.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my proposed article! As the source of the wealth of Herodes Atticus probably was his grandfather, i thought some sentences could exist for him, having also an interesting story. His name is (or almost is) as set in my article, through many sources (of which a mentioned in the article only one):
http://www.geni.com/people/Tiberius-Claudius-Hipparchus-de-Marathon/6000000013238402549

Marathonios shows descent from Marathon, a famous town of Attica. It was usual at the time to always add the town to which one was belonging. So, most of the times one was using only his first name, but among faraway people the town was used as well (Thales of Miletus or Miletios etc). Whether Wikipedia's policy is to use the full name or just the first i cannot tell and i would appreciate your advice.
But.. in this article http://mapyourinfo.com/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/Herodes%20Atticus/ (see Ancestry) Wikipedia already uses that exact name!  
Probably the right spelling might have been Marathonius, as all the name in in latin, but mostly is mentioned as Marathonios, so i would vote this way.

Thanks for your note. If you create future AFC nominations, the record-keeping is easier if you will create an account, instead of using a variety of IP addresses. My original AFC comment was based on the linked sources not supporting your submission. It appeared to me that bits of information about different ancient figures were being mixed up together. This runs of the risk of an article misinforming our readers. In your above post, geni.com etc are not considered to be WP:Reliable sources for Wikipedia. The Google Book is OK but it only confirms that Herod Atticus's grandfather was known as Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus, without the word 'Marathonios'. So your information has no reliable source. Herod Atticus may have had a relative known as 'Marathonios', but that seems to be a different person who was born after the death of Hipparchus.    """,0

RfC: The Correct Name Of The Video Game (Independent Of The Article's Title)

Foreword: as the section's title indicates, this matter is completely irrelevant to the title of this Wikipedia article.

The concern right now involves the correct title of this video game. One position is C: The Contra Adventure, the other is simply The Contra Adventure. The latter is supported only by the assumption that the large """"C"""" in the game's packaging case and manual is nothing more than a """"logogram"""" and not part of the actual name.

There is weighted evidence that supports the notion that the official name of this video game is C: The Contra Adventure. Here is a sample of reputable sources, out of a pool of several:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure

Further, the other games in the Contra series have a similar design to the name on their packaging:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Hard_Corps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Legacy_of_War
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Shattered_Soldier
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Corps:_Uprising

They are universally and unanimously accepted as having the colon and the text that precedes it in the official title.

The strongest evidence that supports the title of C: The Contra Adventure is present directly in the video game's instruction manual, on several pages:

"Epalela fish pond 
 Epalela fish pond

A fish pond, or fishpond, is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish and is used in aquaculture for fish farming, or is used for recreational fishing or for ornamental purposes. In the medieval European era it was typical for monasteries and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have a fish pond.

History

During the winter, supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle. Although meat would be available from deer parks, this couldn't supply the needs of the whole household. A fish pond provided an elegant solution. As long as there was a natural flow of water into the pond, fish required no feeding and were available all year round. There would usually be a series of ponds, with fish being moved between them as they grew.

I'm not sure I get your point.  Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.  As well, there could be notable trolls or notable trolling groups who don't self-aggrandize, and certainly not to the extent and in the joie de vire manner the GNAA does.  Indeed, many trolling groups and individuals try to obscure or hide the fact that they're trolls, which often makes their activities more successful. Therefore, phrase is clearly relevant and not POV. """,0

I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final """"court of appeal"""" but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single """"accountability moment"""" once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11""",0

 False & Un-substantiated Attacks on Arthur Freed 

Dear Wikipedia:

I am writing to request that the biography of my grandfather, Arthur Freed, be edited by removing the false, outrageous and unsubstantated allegations made first by Shirley Temple in her autobiography and then repeated by Aljean Harmatz in her book on the making of Wizard of Oz about my grnadfather conducting a lewd act in the presence of Shirley Temple at the time of his casting Qizard of Oz.

These allegations were made only first 50 years after they allegedly happened when Shirley Tempole wrote her autobiography and vented her anger over my grandfather giving the relatively unknown Judy Garland the part of Dorothy over very well known Shirley Temple.

There has never been a shred of evidence incdluing third party statements to substantiate these untrue and hurtful to our family outrageous charges.

Further, I see some idot has written on wikipedia about some previous editing of these false statements referring to my grandfather as a child abuser.

Wikipedia  as one of the Internet's most respected sources of information  should respect the foundation of American jurisprudence  """"innocent until proven guilty""""  and remove this ridiculous and painful statement.

If you wish to discuss this further with me, please contact me directly.

I would appreciate both the courtesy of a reply and to see that Wikipedia will correct this terrible injustice to my grandfather and our family by remocing totally unsubstantited false allegations.

Since it appears that you have escalated your case to ArbCom, there is really no point in echoing your arguments on your talk page in this way.  You should offer any further information directly and exclusively to ArbCom via e-mail.  If they decide to believe you and reinstate your account, you can share the news here with the rest of us at that time.

Also, previously, I offered you some very concrete suggestions for establishing who you are (as opposed to making claims of who you are not).  If you are not in fact """"Justice Forever"""" and are serious about wanting to convince ArbCom of this fact, I would strongly recommend you follow those suggestions ASAP.  Your latest piece of """"new evidence"""" is really about the same as trying to clear your name via a checkuser request — something which, as you should already understand, is almost never accepted as a way of disproving sockpuppet allegations, and which in fact is more often taken as evidence that you are a sock trying to blow smoke in people's faces.  Unless you present your most convincing information to ArbCom right now, you are likely to find them unwilling to listen to anything further you might have to say, regardless of its merits.

I'm going to stop watching your talk page at this point.  If you are a sock of """"Justice Forever"""", you're wasting my time — and if you are not """"Justice Forever"""", I may be wasting your time by making you feel there is a reason to continue arguing your case here (and in this particular way) rather than talking only to ArbCom and trying to make the kind of case with them that has a chance (though I don't know how much of a chance) of actually working.  Further posting of your arguments here, on your talk page, is very likely to make some admin decide to block you from being able to edit your talk page (and also to semi-protect your talk page to keep you from editing via IP addresses without logging in first).

"Article Evaluation  

Article Evaluation 
For this assignment, I was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about Change Management. The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. 
The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. 
The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. 
Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.",0

"P.S. On further reflection, I see that there is at least one point that I clearly overstated in our discussion. Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source. This probably is what I should have said back in January, and I apologize for making my case in such an inflected voice. Also, I take it that your first language is not English, so I should have been more sensitive to the possibility of unintentional offense. While I don't know for a fact that you took offense at all, I'm troubled by the correspondence between our discussion and your departure from the project.

 strong contradiction! 

I came here from the article """"Italian language"""". This is the sentence I was reading:

""""Standard Italian [...] is somewhat intermediate between the Italo-Dalmatian languages of the South and the Gallo-Romance Northern Italian languages.""""

The link """"Italo-Dalmatian languages"""" send me here. In this articol I learn that Italo-Western languages are all Romamces languages except Romanian and Sardinian. But I was reading """"Italo-Dalmatian languages of the South[ern Italy]"""" since I thought Southern Italian are Eastern like extint Dalmatian! In the chart one more version: Dalmatian =East and Italian dialect(???) =West. It's crazy!

This confusing classification seems it would not say the truth: North-Italian =West, strictly relative with French, Occitan and Catalan (this is an evidence) and South-Italian =East, with no strict relatives.

Scope of the article
David Art's book is mentioned in the article, so I think a good starting point should be what he wrote:  """"In this book, I use """"far right"""" as an umbrella term for any political party, voluntary association, or extraparliamentary movement that differentiates itself from the mainstream right....""""Radical right"""" refers to a specific type of far right party that began to emerge in the late 1970s....[T]here has been a convergence around the term in the literature...."""" (Inside the Radical Right: The Development of Anti-Immigrant Parties in Western Europe (2011), p. 10)  He then says his definition draws from Betz (1994) and Mudde (2007).

My first comment is that since Art says there is convergence on use of the term we should not use in text attribution.  We should just acknowledge that while there is no consistency on terminology, the term normally refers to the wave of right-wing parties that began to emerge in the 1970s.  We should only  use in-text attribution when someone says something original.  For example Art refers to Betz when he provides Betz's explanation of why these parties are right-wing.

Second, we need to ensure that the article is about a specific topic, in this case the parties and groups that began to emerge in the late 70s, and include only comments about these parties where the author is clearly referring to them.  For example, some writers use the term radical right to refer to parties such as the BNP but not UKIP.  Other writers may not use the term radial right but may call them """"third wave"""" of the Extreme Right Party family, as Mudde did in his 1996 article """"The War of Words Defining the Extreme Right Party Family.""""  Incidentally we should have an article that family too.  It's definition is similar to Art's use of """"far right"""", although that term is more usually used for the more right-wing of the Extreme Right Parties, such as the BNP.

"""(outdent) I have reverted 's latest edit here. The reasons for this are numerous. First off, Doright seems to consistently ignore the request to propose and gain consensus for edits to the introduction that have been made throughout this page. Notice that near the top of the page, I proposed removing the seccond paragraph from the introduction altogether, since its emphasis on the recentism of Palestinian identity seems WP:UNDUE. Despite some agreement from other editors, I have not proceeded with that move, in order to gain full consensus first. When Doright comes along and ignores that discussion and others on this page stressing the importance of gaining consensus to changes to the introduction before editing so as to avoid edit-warring, it's disrespectful to others who are patiently waiting to gain consensus first. It also increases the tendency towards edit-warring, so please stop it. Besides that, regarding the content added, all Doright has done is further emphasize the """"recentism"""" by repeating the information at the end of the second paragraph and the beginning of that paragraph. This completely ignores the views of other editors regarding the WP:UNDUE emphasis of having this paragraph in the introduction, increases the WP:UNDUE emphasis further, and is redundant.

I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account """"bryansee"""" on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:

 The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.
 This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well.
 This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally """"forcedmemefred"""" is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment.
 Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a """"human sacrifice""""; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's """"well"""", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).
 I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.
 And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.
 BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.
 He gives people kittens. """"Kittens"""" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.
 He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.
 He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of """"seeing a doctor/therapist"""" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.
 He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.
 Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and """"truth"""" is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

There has to be a balance between the details that clearly explain a character, and the fanish devotion that inspires an entire website.  In struggling to maintain that balance, we editors often find ourselves in conflict.  I believe that's what is happening here.  Jason's 'importance' is POV.  He was barely mentioned in the original crisis, and only because his return to life was attributed to Superboy-Prime did his return elicit Infinite Crisis attention.  We have no idea how important he'll end up being in Countdown, since they change these things on the fly, and we'd be speculating if we were to state anything beyond what has happened.  Remember, this article should not be a substitute for reading the comics.  Now I do agree that character development, including the predicament with his parentage, should be addressed, however there's no need to make a wholesale change when addressing one situation at a time would be more productive as a fellow editor.
I disagree about 'inappropriate' language in the Death in the Family section. It looks fine to me, and since it links to the main article, were more detail can be read, there's no need to expand it further.

Hi - two or more stub types which you created have been nominated for deletion or renaming at Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion. The stub types (templates or categories), which were not proposed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, do not meet the standard requirements for a stub type, either through being incorrectly named, ambiguously scoped, or through failure to meet standards relating to the current stub hierarchy or likely size, as explained at Wikipedia:Stub. Please feel free to make any comments at WP:SFD regarding these stub types, and in future, please consider proposing new stub types first!

It is worth noting that stub templates are virtually never created for independentist regions until such time that they are recognised internationally by a significant number of countries, as these stub types tend to become the targets of potential edit-warring (something which has far more far-reaching effects on templates than it has on articles). Thus, for example, there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus, since it is only recognised by one country. If Abkhazia and South Ossetia become recognised by more than just one country, then feel free to propose the creation of stub types for them. Until then, it is generally accepted practice with stub sorting for them not to have separate stub types. ...wha? """,0

"Status and Advice  

As reviewing administrator, I  deleted the article, not necessarily because of no indication of importance, but because it was a purely promotional c.v.

A Wikipedia article needs to show notability with references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases.   
It also needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press release list everything a person does; write in paragraph format about the key points of the education and career. 

Be aware you will need to write the articles to Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style. List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Web of Science. Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio.  

It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV.  For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference.

Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Keep in mind that the goal of an encyclopedia  is to say things in a concise manner, which is not the style of  press releases or  web sites, which are usually more expansive.

As a general rule, a suitable page will be best written by someone without Conflict of Interest; it's not impossible to do it properly with a conflict of interest   but it's relatively more difficult: you are automatically thinking in terms of what the subject wishes to communicate to the public, but an uninvolved person will think in terms of what the public might wish to know. If you think you can do it right according to our guidelines, do so, but expect the article to be carefully checked for objectivity.

YOU PEOPLE ARE AT IT AGAIN.

He first started achieving major public notoriety in early 2007, when he made complaints of harassment at Columbia University, against students who allegedly called him a """"baby killer"""" for being in the military

No, he first made his complaints in early 2006. This gained him attention at Columbia. Then he wrote articles for a student newspaper, a military newspaper and on some right-wing blogs. That got him noticed by national right-wing media, i.e., Fox News. In late 2006, left-wing students publicized his pornography background. It was largely ignored.

Then he got the CPAC award on the same day that Ann Coulter made her comment about John Edwards. That caused the gay blogs to dig up what had been reported in late '06. The story of CPAC applauding Coulter while honoring a gay porn star and hooked spread to non-gay liberal blogs, and then to MSNBC's Countdown. That's how it became a national story.

In the ensuing controversy, it became public knowledge that Sanchez himself had been a performer in homosexual/bisexual[4] adult films in the early 1990s. The story became popular in the blogosphere, especially among homosexual bloggers who insinuated rumors about the details of Sanchez's past.

Sanchez appears in 38 gay porn movies. About 15 of them are originals, the rest re-compilations. Of the 38 videos, one is titled """"Bi Conflict,"""" but in that video Sanchez performs homosexual acts. Sanchez has never had anything other than gay sex on film. These are not """"homosexual/bisexual films."""" He is a gay porn actor who appeared in gay porn films for gay viewers.

There has been no """"insinuation"""" of """"rumors."""" Rather, there has been reporting of solid evidence. Sanchez prostituted under the name Excellent Top between 1999 and 2002, and operated the No Regrets Massage service, a front for prostitution, in 2004. He directly admitted prostitution in an appearance on the Alan Colmes show on March 8, 2007, and in an article published the same day on Salon.com

Sanchez revealed that Countdown never bothered to contact him before running the television report. Countdown sourced several gay blogs to complete the report, as well as committed left-wing ideologue Max Blumenthal who claimed that Sanchez was apart of a greater """"an underground railroad"""" for fallen gay right-wingers.

Calling Bluemental """"a committed left-wing ideologue"""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor script. It is an outrageous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. So is saying that Sanchez """"revealed"""" that Countdown """"never bothered"""" to contact him.

Critics charge that Sanchez has given conflicting statements about rumors from anonymous bloggers.

The use of the phrase """"rumors from anonymous bloggers"""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor, an is an outraegous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. First off, they are not rumors. Remember, the so-called """"rumors"""" have proven true. Secondly, most bloggers are anonymous. This does not by itself indict them or the information they provide, any more than a newspaper story without a byline indicts the newspaper that prints it.

In an op-ed piece in Salon.com, Sanchez likened porn to prostitution, he subsequently said he wanted to draw that same analogy on his first appearances on Colmes Radio show.""""[24]

First off, whatever he claimed that he had """"wanted"""" to do on Colmes is immaterial. The Colmes interview stands on its own. Secondly, he made the claim about what he """"wanted"""" to do on a blog. But this time, it was on a right-wing """"ex-gay"""" blog. Since when does Wikipedia elevation right-wing ex-gay blogs to a superior status? Some """"neutrality"""" you people show!

A later report by the same writer appeared on April 1, 2007, indicating that Sanchez was also being investigated by the Marine Corps for fraudulently soliciting funds from two organizations, the United War Veteran's Council and U-Haul, in order to fund a deployment to Iraq which he never actually made. Sanchez has denied the charges; saying that he never collected money from either organization.[25]

Excuse me, but Sanchez's denial of fraudulent solicitation is a non-denial. In fact, Sanchez admitted soliciting the money. Whether or not he collected it has no bearing on whether or not he solicited it. Those are two separate issues. Extortion doesn't have to succeed to be extortion.

There is a larger point to be made here, which is that Sanchez's various explataions have been a circus of multi-contradictions. It is not """"neutral"""" to split the difference. Facts are neutral. So report the facts. How hard is it to report the facts?""",0

Making sure we apply the same, consistent standards in two comparable cases, and initiation a discussion on a consistent policy, is not a point maneuvre in any way.",0

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that """"CITATION NEEDED"""" was not vandalism, then the next time they used """"NEED CITATION"""", or """"CITATION REQUIRED"""" or """"FACT CHECK"""", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  """,0

1) You have failed to explain what the quote does for the article besides trying to say """"Well, they're just theists, so why listen to them?""""

2) Then where is this majority of scholars that are not historians?
Richard Burridge, Graham Gould, Van Voorst, Graham Stanton, R.T. France are heads of theology departments. I can not find whether they were taught in a divinity school, though.
Michael Grant is an atheist and a full-fledged historian.
James Frazer studied myth and religion in general.

An excerpt from online, detailing some of those who oppose the hypothesis:
""""Meier [Meie.MarJ, 23] notes that what we know about Alexander the Great could fit on only a few sheets of paper; yet no one doubts that Alexander existed. Charlesworth has written that """"Jesus did exist; and we know more about him than about almost any Palestinian Jew before 70 C.E."""" [Chars.JesJud, 168-9] Sanders [Sand.HistF, xiv] echoes Grant, saying that """"We know a lot about Jesus, vastly more than about John the Baptist, Theudas, Judas the Galilean, or any of the other figures whose names we have from approximately the same date and place."""" On the Crucifixion, Harvey writes: """"It would be no exaggeration to say that this event is better attested, and supported by a more impressive array of evidence, than any other event of comparable importance of which we have knowledge from the ancient world."""" [Harv.JesC, 11] Dunn [Dunn.EvJ, 29] provides an anecdote similar to the one above regarding Shakespeare. Referring to Wells' thesis, he writes:
 

    The alternative thesis is that within thirty years there had evolved such a coherent and consistent complex of traditions about a non-existent figure such as we have in the sources of the Gospels is just too implausible. It involves too many complex and speculative hypotheses, in contrast to the much simpler explanation that there was a Jesus who said and did more or less what the first three Gospels attribute to him. The fact of Christianity's beginnings and the character of its earliest tradition is such that we could only deny the existence of Jesus by hypothesizing the existence of some other figure who was a sufficient cause of Chrstianity's beginnings - another figure who on careful reflection would probably come out very like Jesus!

Finally, let's seal the coffin on consenus with these words from a hardened skeptic and an Emeritus Professor of History, Morton Smith [Hoff.JesH, 47-8] . Of Wells' work, this historian and skeptic of orthodox Christianity wrote:

""""I don't think the arguments in (Wells') book deserve detailed refutation.""""

""""...he argues mainly from silence.""""

""""...many (of his arguments) are incorrect, far too many to discuss in this space.""""
 

""""(Wells) presents us with a piece of private mythology that I find incredible beyond anything in the Gospels.""""

None of these scholars, we emphasize, are friends of fundamentalism or evangelical Christianity. Contrary to the protestations of the """"Jesus-myth"""" consortium, they make their statements based on evidence, not ideology. Conspiracy and bias exist only in their own imagination.

Again, the fact is is that the complaint isn't relevant. The mainstream historian position, which would hardly be mostly Christian, supports the claim that Jesus was a historical person. All that quote does is try to attack the speaker's instead of the evidence, and it would be blatantly dishonest to try to include it. Provide all the arguments for the claim that you want - but this isn't one of them. Koromon survived intact. """,0

You deleted the posted page """"Ben van Bergen"""", without evidently checking the sources such as imdb for confirmation.  Also other sources were quoted in the page, such as Screen Actors Guild and Variety, which would have confirmed certain things.  Finally, because of work there was no time to respond to the 'removal' notices, and, since being new to Wikipedia, it seems to me that the criteria etc. are overly laborious and allow for willy-nilly actions.

Hi SilkTork.

""""Too bad for you all the above were proven wrong by the scientific community"""" huh????? do u mean the Greek community?? cuz the last time I checked the Albanians wore proven to be linked to Illyrians,the last I checked the Albanian languange was and is Indo-European.
Guys a Arvanite that says I'am Greek its not a Arvanit but a Greek!The ancestors of the arvanites where Albanian farmers and highlanders from Toskëria and Epirus!My great-grandfather was Arvanit..Arbanitika belongs to the linguistic family of Albanian.The first Christian Albanian migrations to central and southern(note: Albanian of north-western Greece are on Albanian native lands) of what is today Greek territory took place as early as the XI-XII centuries (Trudgill, 1975:5; Banfi, 1994:19), although the main ones most often mentioned in the bibliography happened in the XIV-XV centuries, when Albanians were invited to settle in depopulated areas by their Byzantine, Catalan or Florentine rulers (Tsitsipis, 1994:1; Trudgill, 1975:5; Nakratzas, 1992:20-24 & 78-90; Banfi, 1994:19). According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.

When the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).

C'est la vie.

it's not a huge issue; this will quickly end up on ArbCom's plate anyway as a matter editor behavior, from some place or other - there's just too much tension around this particular problem, and too many people acting out on it like children.

I have edited Robot, AGV, and some of the articles about vacuums and lawnmowers...not much more than that, related to robotics.  You've tagged several hundred articles as belonging to your wikiproject, without editing any of them, at least not the ones I'm watching, which is most of them.  I'm not criticizing you...I think it's possible that tagging a bunch of articles could be helpful, it might get more people to sign up for WikiProject Robotics and share experiences first, and then edit.  On the other hand, it might mean that people who would otherwise edit won't edit, out of a sense that the article belongs to some other group, or they might misunderstand the """"low"""" priority.  I haven't been around long enough to know what works and what doesn't, I guess we'll see.

The problem was after an administrator (not sure if it was you) looked at the book listings, and were happy they were neutral, about two weeks later, user , decided to sabotage the book descriptions, and add on some totally irrelevant, inaccurate and slanderous ad hominem attacks on the book's author, and he inserted them at the beginning of the book descriptions to try and discredit the content with a blatant ad hominem attack. The ad hominem attacks were removed, and then accusations by  were manufactured of having an """"edit war"""", when he was the one to start trashing the page after it was approved.  was also the one to start a destruction campaign against the separate page that the critical links and books were on before. He appears to be very fundamentalist and not too concerned about using propaganda and slander to dissuade people from seeing any critical information. His accusations (beside being ad hominem) were also completely incorrect. Duffer appears not to give a damn about accuracy, or relevance, or the fact that ad hominem and propaganda are not acceptable on Wikepedia. JWs usually refer to this trashing and slander as """"theocratic war strategy"""", basically meaning anything goes (including lies and slander) if the end result is to promote the religion. I have removed the ad hominem and I hope it will not return.  is also problematic in the same regard, as he appears to not realise when he is using propaganda, (or insults above) but is clear to see it when someone else may use it against him or JWs, demonstrating his interesting double standards (a sad, but typical Watch Tower Society characteristic).

Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to """"kiboze""""). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. 

James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.

Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.

Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.

"Mathematicians hired to monitor transactions 

I removed the following part of the article:

 Business.dk reported that the bank has a team of mathematicians employed to surveil the clients' trading patterns.

Saxo Bank is not doing anything untraditional in employing mathematicians, since indeed most larger financial institutions employ a number of mathematicians, economists and even physicists. To a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing, but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing, and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity. 

Furthermore, the secret source in the business.dk article referenced claims that Saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns (in order to take unfair advantage of customers). However, and this is not stated in the business.dk article: Saxo shows the same two-sided price, for the same amount, at the same time, to any and all clients trading. This means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest. 

Therefore the accusation in the business.dk article is not only wrong, but also shows the lack of insight from the secret source and the journalist who wrote it. The fact that an article was brought in an online newspaper does not excuse wrong information. In relation to this particular statement regarding the role of the employed mathematicians, therefore, the article is in my opinion an unreliable source, in accordance with the Wikipedia principles of WP:IRS

Either this information regarding the widespread use of mathematicians among larger financial institutions, and regarding Saxo showing the two-sided price etc. should be included, (which I originally did until it was removed) to clarify to the lay reader that this is not uncommon or suspicious, and correct the mistaken information in the business.dk article, or the information about employing mathematicians should be left out completely, to preserve the neutrality of the article.",0

If you just want my opinion, it seems from the few tussles you and Ramallite have had, you often edit POV bits into the articles, but at the same time Ramallite is incapable of respecting the NPOV facts that you do add or are contained within your edits to the point where his actions are just as bad. An example would be your addition about the number of wells cut off by the barrier (I can't find it now and only recall it somewhat). While some of your addition I remember as strongly POV, there were important facts contained within it such as that the Israel government says that no wells have been cut off. If I remember correctly, Ramallite simply reverted which is not appropriate. Another example I see is part of your recent edit. Some of it I think is POV such as implying all Israelis agree in the first statement, whether you meant """"Israel the government"""" or """"Israel the citizens"""" is unclear. One thing that irked me was Ramallite's reversion of the following addition: """"The Israeli government states that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent the infiltration of terrorists, and that any hardship imposed on Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism."""" This I believe is completely true and you are attributing it so it should be easy to verify. The current version: """"Although the Israeli government has said that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent attacks and that any hardship to Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism, the barrier's opponents say the barrier is the de facto future border of the State of Israel."""" is argumentative and implies the first statement is false and last statement is true as a result of the conditional """"Although"""" which implies contradiction. This is far more POV than your addition. Considering that he says he will continue to work on the articles where you have the dispute I would be inclined to oppose the nomination based on this alone.

"General review of article ==

The Wikipedia article on François Mitterrand, who served as president of France from 1981 to 1995, does not take a neutral stance on the man and his career. The language, organization and fact choices of the article make clear the author’s negative opinion of Mitterrand. Even though the sources of information for the article are weak, the author attempts to convey the disreputable nature of his career by citing various scandals and controversies. Because the author is biased, it is difficult to obtain an accurate picture of Mitterrand from reading this article.

By the end of the third paragraph, with the comment about Mitterrand denying having received the Francisque, the author is already trying to establish Mitterrand’s sketchy past. He or she is trying to persuade the reader that Mitterrand was a less than honorable man who will be remembered more for scandals than for what he accomplished during his presidency. The author mentions Charles de Gaulle’s supposed dislike of Mitterrand, his covering up of illegal acts during the repression of the independence movement, and a possible attempt to stage his own assassination. Other scandals include false health reports, adultery, and an anti-terror cell he set up that may have “obtained wiretaps on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Mitterrand’s personal affairs.” Scandals are mentioned throughout the article and the author ends with a section devoted to them, so the reader is left with little recollection of Mitterrand’s accomplishments but a strong memory of the controversy that surrounded the president’s career. 

Though the author uses phrases like “he was said to,” one senses that the author is assuming that the alleged stories are fact, and that he has drawn conclusions about Mitterrand based on those stories. Also, the author mentions Mitterrand in relation to other leaders and sometimes it appears that Mitterrand does not measure up. The author seems to favor Charles de Gaulle, noting that Mitterrand was “one of the few to object to the nomination of Charles de Gaulle as head of the government and de Gaulle’s plan for a French Fifth Republic.” The author also uses a phrase usually applied to de Gaulle’s decline to Mitterrand’s decline (“crossing of the desert”). When discussing Mitterrand’s annual laying of a wreath on Philippe Pétain’s grave, the author makes sure to remark that “the annual tributes…marked a departure from those of his predecessors.”

The article is convincing in its portrayal of Mitterrand as a controversial figure whose career was characterized by some major accomplishments but also a great deal of scandal. The article also convinces the reader that much about Mitterrand is not known for sure; there is a fair amount of speculation surrounding all of it. It appears that the author tries to downplay Mitterrand’s accomplishments and convince the reader that his legacy is not a good one. This is not convincing however, because Mitterrand served longer as president than any other man; he must have been more popular than the author makes him out to be.

The sources for this article appear inadequate. Unlike some Wikipedia articles, this article does not have a bibliography or list of references so it is unclear where the author is getting his information. He says that one piece of information comes from author Jean Montaldo but does not list the book. There are three numbered links within the article: two links to articles from the French newspaper Le Monde, and one link to an article on netscape.qc.ca. While these are acceptable sources, they cannot compare to primary sources or articles from historical journals. The lack of adequate sources makes some of the author’s claims questionable.

The quality of writing of the article is not outstanding. There is a typo in the second paragraph: “an mid-level functionary.” At times it is a bit choppy and the paragraphs do not always flow into each other perfectly. The author also devotes an entire section to the famous last meal, and only briefly mentions Mitterrand’s personal life at the end of the presidency section. The article ends with a paragraph that states Mitterrand personally authorized what New Zealand called their first terror attack, which is an interesting choice for a conclusion that leaves the reader associating Mitterrand with terror and bombing. The inclusion of the discovery of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus is puzzling and seems unnecessary, as do the two paragraphs about Bérégovoy and Pelat. It appears that some pieces of information were included simply to paint a more negative portrait of Mitterrand. 

I would have liked to know more about Mitterrand’s “great projects,” because the projects that are listed seem to be very significant structures in France. Some additional information about his personal life woul",0

confused state of """"medieval"""" connections

What is the earliest reference to the post-1991 flag?  Adoption by the  United National Movement dates to c. 1999.  Kldiashvili wrote a """"History of the Georgian heraldry"""" in 1997.

 Supposed influence on historical events 

I am entirely new to editing so I hope someone can guide me on this matter. The claim """"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States"""" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn't terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.

Where does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson's Bay Company was established, with the company """"joining"""" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don't see this event holding """"great influence"""" over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.

So what should be done about this exactly? The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate. In the meantime I updated the link, but it is worth repeating it doesn't validate the claim.   """,0

Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -

My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit.

"""*:well... now that I look at the article more closely I can at least see where this movereq is coming from, and it's not as tendentious as I thought. This article is a mess... I still don't support renaming it though, as the """"provide a worldwide view"""" within this article is a mistake. As I mentioned above there are plenty of articles that can and should provide a worldwide view of Gun control issues, but the subject of this article is a US centric subject and should be re-factored in order to be presented as such. Rather then worrying about the name just get to work copy editing the article.
You seem to be arguing that there should be an article split, one article for the global and a split out article for the USA centric views.  Right?  If so, the problem still remains that the title of the global half of the split should have a global viewpoint.  And, the """"keep and"""" portion of the article title (taken from the US Bill of Rights) is decidedly USA centric.  Explain how """"keep and"""" is global.    
Or perhaps the article could take an approach as describing purely the concept of RKBA, and maybe the cultures and/nations where it exists, and other subjects as necessary (although I suspect the same debates will come up in those areas).  Perhaps altering the general approach and method of the article could be an alternative to renaming/moving it.  I'd be willing to give it a shot if everyone else would.  """,0

Sweden=

The legal actions taken by the Swedish royal family is according to the article in SvD not for his comments about Sweden in general, but for his comments about the royal family per se, and then especially his comments about princess Madeleine claiming she being indecent. 

Out of curiosity - does anyone know what these creatures (I won't have them in the same category as us humans) at WBC make of the United Nations? I can imagine they'll hate it, as they seem to hate everything in the universe, but it would be interesting to know...

I completely agree with the guy above me, but as this is an encyclopedia, why do we have to start an article about a schurch off with """"hate group""""?

Perhaps because these are a group of people who rejoyce when thousands of children die in terrible tragedies and come to funerals to yell vial things at the loved ones of the people that fought for their rights. What the hell should we start it off with? This is a local church that has very good after-school programs? 

Hatred of Islam and muslims, however despicable, is not racism, and neither is hatred of Catholics or Catholicism.  In general the racism section is pretty weak.  There is plenty bad to be said about Phelps without bringing the allegation that he uses the word """"nigger.""""  

Nice work.  Much better. I removed the NPOV tag. 

This article could be accused of not quite attaining NPOV, but it is clear that the writers have made an attempt to see this ridiculous crusade from both sides that is nothing short of heroic.  Patrick Beverley, 15 August 2005

Former Members of Westboro Baptist Church

The article has been updated with the following:

""""George Stutzman, Theresa Davis, Chris Davis, Karl Hockenbarger, Bill Hockenbarger and his wife, James Hockenbarger and Joshua Phelps-Roper are no longer members of the Westboro Baptist Church.""""

Where did this information come from? The Hockenbargers have been members of the church for a long time. I believe Chris Davis is married to Rebekah Phelps-Davis, one of Fred Phelps' children. His leaving the church would mean that he and Rebekah are no longer together. Joshua is one of the children of church spokesperson Shirley Phelps-Roper. His leaving would probably mean that he no longer has a relationship with his parents. (As Dorothea Bird once said: """"If you're in, you're in. If you're out, you're out.)

Hate group

Any chance of this article having a further early emphasis on it being a recognised hate group?

Lies

The westboro baptist CULT disgrace me. They hate catholics because they aparantly abuse children and are homosexuals. This is absolute lies and heavily offensive. The fact that they make up so much lies and how there actions are contradicted within the bible should be given more attention. Anyone agree?

Appearance

I remember an appearance by a woman and her children on the Howard Stern show... they were members of the Westboro Church, and in the few minutes I watched one thing that the woman said struck me as an interesting point: """"I don't hate fags, God hates fags,"""" or something to that effect.

 Mangojuice, I am not against articles on coats of arms as such, that would be absurd. I am against using Western Sahara as a subsitute for the """"Sahrawi Republic"""". This is where the bug lies and this goes across all topics related to the Western Sahara conflict where koavf is involved (with his systematic reverts).
 Western Sahara is, again, 1) a disputed territroy and 2) under Moroccan administration. It has as such no national coat of arms (a part may be from the one of the power that administrates it). To have an article showing the coat of arms of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" on the disputed Western Sahara territory is nothing but using wikipedia for Polisario political interests!
 The """"Sahrawi Republic"""", which is nothing but a governement in exile, has one however. It can appear on its page, I have no problem with it.
 Result: None - as far as I am aware of - is wanting to delete """"Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic"""". It should only not be same as """"Coat of arms of Western Sahara""""
 I don't know whether this is clear or not, otherwise happy to discuss every detail.
 The problem we are having with koavf is that he is a fervent militant of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" and wants absolutely to have Western Sahara be a subtitute for this republic ín Wikipedia.
 And he is editwarring everyone who thinks differently, even when this costs him to be blocked on indefinite, and again and again.
 Only a strong admin can stop him. The best solution would be to ban him from editing the topic as had been suggested once already.
 Unfortunately he is unblocked every time by admins who want to show good will, although he does not care and just ignore them once they have unblocked him.
 We are having this situation not for the first time now and this is really exhausting!

Restoring WP:NPOV to the Paris article

I invite everyone to read again the WP:NPOV policy of Wikipedia:
Editing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.

Currently, the article is heavily biased towards a historical/heritage representation of Paris. The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn't been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV.

Facts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today's Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructures, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airports, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe.

To know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ). I've counted words of each section (including their paragraphs in introduction), and in order to give a point of comparison, I've done the same about London, which is a similar size capital city of a similar country.
Field of interestParisLondonNumber of words% of totalNumber of words% of totalHistory3,573 words22%2,048 words17%Heritage4,277 words26%204 words2%Culture2,545 words15%1,661 words14%Subtotal10,395 words63%3,913 words32%Economy673 words4%727 words6%Demographics852 words5%1,605 words13%Transport819 words5%1,693 words14%Subtotal2,344 words13%4,025 words33%Overall total16,388 words100%12,131 words100%
It's worth being mentionned though that London's culture section is entirely dedicated to today's culture. But even putting that aspect aside, the London article, which seems well-balanced, talk about as much of History, heritage and culture than it does of economy, demographics and transports. In the case of Paris, sections about the """"past"""" aspects are 4.5 times bigger than those about today's aspect. In reading this article, we can decently believe that today's Paris is judged not relevant any",0

I tried expanding the lead a bit, but now the problem I'm running into is that it's hard to summarize each section of the article without simply repeating information that appears later. I suppose this is a consequence of the article being short to begin with. Any advice?
Concerning your comment about drifting between singular and plural language, I'm not sure how to avoid this more than I already have. I tried to use singular (""""Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat"""", """"the bat"""", or """"it"""") wherever possible but in some cases I felt it was necessary to instead use plural for nouns like """"colonies"""" and """"populations"""".

Again, thanks for your help. talk """,0

Any reason why? As we dont want vandalism on the Main Page so that is why it's protected. Theres not much to change anyway since its split into articles in a different area.  ۝۝۝҈ ►talk► 

And the fact that it is automatically updated per transcluded pages and variables ({{Wikipedia:Featured Article/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}).  ~trip 

Shh! It's obviously a vandal trying to learn how to vandalise the Main Page. Feed them disinformation!  

The page is cascadingly (if that's even a word) protected, so if he or she is a vandal, there is no way that he or she could vandalize pages transcluded onto the main page.  ~trip 
You have to type in the """"super-password"""" into the searchbox, which Jimbo Wales gives to his most trusted users. Then, you get a big red button that says """"Are you sure you want to edit the Main Page?"""". If you click it, you can edit it (but only you, because it reads the user's IP address). Once you make the edit, it takes effect (but it isn't recorded in history, and can only be seen in a special log, which is only accessable using the """"super-password""""). That's why they say things like {{CURRENTMONTH}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, etc., to fool new users. MISDISINFORMATION COMPLETE ·  Talk

Don't listen to AO. The correct way to edit the main page is simple. To edit the main page you need to follow these steps:
Take off all your clothes
Get a friend, parent or whatever to take a photo of you editing wikipedia naked. This photo must be at least 1500x1000 pixels. (Editing the page Naked will extend your editing capability by 1 minutes but any other page is fine)
Upload said found to the wikimedia commons under a license of you choice
Go to the sandbox and put your photo there
Repeat the above step 12 times when the photo gets changed
Once you've done this, come back and click on view source. You will see a message on your screen for about 1 second. It will give you the name of a page you must edit. If you productively edit this page within 5 seconds you will now be able to edit the main page! If you miss either of this you will have to start all over again from step one (including a new photo)
Be aware that if at any time you vandalise wikipedia or try to pass off a photo of someone else as you, you will be banned from editing the main page for life x 100
Good luck!
 
Hmm... I know this discussion is cold, but wouldn't it be awesome if the Welcome to Wikipedia box said """"everyone can edit - even this very page!"""" or """"Click here to edit this very page?"""" This would really reinforce the idea of Wikipedia's editability. Maybe: somehow protect the current content of the page, and add a box containing edits at the bottom? I realise no-one would ever agree to this - the chances of vandalism, profanity etc. being posted there are 100%. But it would be pretty cool, wouldn't it? Goldfritter 07:18, 7 April 2007 (",0

Please leave messages that need to be read on Tony Sidaway's talk page

This bot is approved and doesn't need a flag.  Except for tests, it's inactive.

The software it runs is called .  It's open source (BSD license) and written in compiled Chicken Scheme.

Purpose
This is to be a general purpose query engine for English Wikipedia, using a simple functional programming interface to permit queries of varying complexity to be performed, and the results delivered to a nominated page in the user's userspace and, optionally, sent to the user's enabled email address.

Query language
The query language is based on scheme, a dialect of the lisp family.  If you can write a simple lisp expression you can query this bot.

Typical query functions will look like:

 (whatlinkshere PAGE)
 Produces a list of pages that link to the page.
 (editorsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]]))
 Produces a list of unique usernames and IP numbers identifying all editors of the page
 (editsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]])
 Produces a list of edits to the page
 (editsby USERNAME/IP [datetime-since [datetime-to]])
 Produces a list of edits by the user
 (apply EXPR [PAR...] LIST)
 Applies the single expression, with optional parameters, to the list
 (map EXPR [PAR...] [LIST...])
 Maps the single expression, with optional parameters, to the each member of the list.
 (list [EXPR...])
 Composes a list of the expressions
 (email EXPR)
 Sends the result of evaluating the expression in email.  The result will also appear on the wiki.

Using the bot
To register to use the bot, you must edit the bulleted list of usernames at User:TonyBot/Users to add a link to a page in your userspace.  If you simply add your userpage (User:Example), then TonyBot will use the page User:Example/TonyBot to communicate with you.  If you add another page in your userspace, then it will use that page instead of User:Example/TonyBot.

To make a query, edit your TonyBot page to add the query.  TonyBot will execute the query and edit your TonyBot page to provide a link to a page containing the results.  This will be at User:TonyBot/Example/N where N is a numeric value which has meaning only to the bot.

Limitations
 Queries that take too long to execute may be stopped before completion
 Queries that are judged too complex will be rejected
 Queries that return very large volumes of data may be rejected or cut short.

The value of """"too long"""", """"too complex"""" and """"very large"""" may vary over time in an unpredictable way.

Conditions of use
This bot is an experimental service and is provided as-is.  Queries are run at the discretion of the bot operator and subject to the operational requirements of Wikipedia's services.  It may be subject to unplanned outages, and may disappear without warning, at the discretion of the operator and subject to the wishes of the community.

All queries must be made by registered Wikipedia users, in public, on the wiki.  The bot owner reserves the right, for good reason and with the interests of Wikipedia in mind, to refuse access to any user.  The reason for refusal will be stated publicly on the user's talk page and may be subject to revision if you can somehow successfully cajole, persuade or provide reasonable reassurances.

Is it UNDO? 
Years later, it's 50% of her OWN self-promoting website. My instincts tell me that loyal fans - that is """"fans"""" as in the root word fanatics, will contact her through her website and pled with her to remove her account of the incident (or see her memory besmirched on Wikipedia! – That’s just humor to make a point, let that knot in your panties loosen up a bit. Come on. Life will go on if a mild accurate account of the arrest is included). JFK had multiple extra marital affairs, people are interested in that fact. In Clinton’s day, people were so interested that he went through impeachment because of his outside-of-marriage-activities. In Mary Ann’s case, it is all the more interesting because it allegedly has been her co-star, Gilligan, supplying her marijuana for years.

BLP: 
No one answers Chowbok’s questions on any of the “reasons” why this information is blocked, that is, “answer” in the sense of saying anything other than rhetoric. WHY MUST THIS INTERESTING EVENT BE EXCLUDED FROM WIKIPEDIA WHEN THE SUBJECT’S OWN WEBSITE DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IT? Because those guarding her memory, unlike her, can’t deal with a least brief mention of the truth? But in that vein, are we as loyal citizens of Gilligan’s Island duty-bound to protect our virgin queen? Grow up. Let the truth be included.

If Mary Ann writes a biography, the excerpts released by the publisher will assuredly include the arrest while in possession of marijuana, and those facts will be the ones that bring attention to her book. The most worn pages of her biography will be the pages discussing the arrest and the aftermath, unless it turns out that she was in a long-running threesome with Mr. Howell and the Skipper. Oh, by the way, why do I refer to her as “Mary Ann?” Because I am being disrespectful; much like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of you are to Chowbok and anyone else who disagrees with you. No amount of charm or politeness on my part is going to win a single one of you over. You need to rise above the digs and the rhetoric and improve this article because the exclusion of this information of significant interest to the vast majority of people hurts Wikipedia. If you can’t get over sweet Mary Ann getting her adorable little button nose dirty, or you can’t rise above me being disrespectful, you surely won’t elevate yourselves to include the facts simply because it is, editorially, the right decision. 
I
F YOU WANT TO PLAY THE ROLE OF EDITOR, THEN TAKE ON THE BURDEN OF DOING THE JOB WITH THE PRIDE OF MAKING UNBIASED EDITORIAL DECISIONS. If you are simply a Mary Ann worshipper, then join her fan club, bow towards Gilligan’s Island seven times a day, and burn incense before her golden image; but don’t pretend to be an editor with the slightest degree of integrity.

Years later, HER ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT is told only through the words of her lawyer. She refuses to give a personal account. I find that fascinating. Even O.J. spoke personally when he denied murdering his ex-wife. Hell, in his case, he spoke DIRECTLY to the Judge in front of a live TV audience, even though he had four of his lawyers standing right next to him. Mary Ann, on her own website, still hides behind the unsigned words of her lawyer (I highly recommend reading his words. If the presentation/spin upon the events is not hysterical to you, you have not yet developed the critical thinking necessary to be an editor (well, anywhere but on Wikipedia; interestingly, a place I do not have the right to edit the Sacred Page of The Virgin Mary Ann). 
The CONSENSUS is that Mary Ann is MORE WIDELY KNOWN for the arrest while in possession of marijuana than anything else she has ever done. It's not only the top single reason that anyone searches for information on her, variations on arrest/marijuana/drunk driving are the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the any searches about her.

BE BOLD?: 
“Be Bold” and edit says Wikipedia’s founder. But the bullies on this issue say, if you are “bold,” you will be sent messages to stop editing, and we will block you from editing anything about Mary Ann as her page is “protected.” 

I can go to the Wikipedia page of Wikipedia creator and founder Jimmy Wales and edit anything I chose on his page, but not so Mary Ann. I can even go to the page about that other “Mary” - you might have heard of her, she gave birth to Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior - and edit anything and everything.

What credibility can any editor of Wikipedia have when its founder’s page can be edited, pages of living and revered religious and historical figures can be edited, but editing of a 1960s’ short run ensemble cast sit-com bit player’s page must be reviewed and “approved” by self-proclaimed “editors,” aka B.O.G.I, the Bullies Of Gilligan’s Island.

Thanks.  I nearly drowned when I was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath, but somehow I managed to swim back on board S.S Titanic.  Ironic really, given what I see coming up ahead.  Perhaps I should have saved myself the trouble, and just stayed in the icy water.

Your comments are interesting and may well be correct, however they don't really address the point I was making, regarding the gross, almost embarrassingly obvious, errors in the """"academic geek created/mindless computer driven"""" financial models currently used around the world.  The most similar """"theory"""" to the one I've pustulated above comes out of  this piece from """"The Prophet"""" Robert K. Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the """"hard"""" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called """"black swan events"""") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).

Landis comes close, but still no (Cuban) cigar.  Anyway, his piece is very topical right now, and made for interesting bedtime reading, tucked away here as I am in my tiny little third class cabin, far far away from the """"mad money"""" crowd.  """,0

Nobody is arguing that a candidate with a majority of first preferences is passed-over in favor of a weaker candidate, nor that some valid ballots are simply ignored...yet that is the impression that Abd's choice of words leaves with most readers.

An event horizon is any surface from beyond which no information can ever reach the observer.  Of course, that includes objects of all kinds - in fact, anything moving at or below the speed of light - so in a sense you're right.  An important thing to note though is that the event horizon - in the strictest sense - belongs to the observer, rather than the thing (not) being observed.  In the case of a black hole, the event horizon is the same for all outside observers, which I guess is what you mean by a 'physical boundary'.  The Event horizon article is biased towards this, the most commonly encountered form of event horizon.  The cosmological event horizon is different: since every point in the Universe is receding from every other point with a speed proportional to distance, the event horizon is always a sphere centred on a particular observer, so there is no single 'event horizon of the Universe' (although of course we tend to give a special place to our own event horizon).

So neither article is wrong, although the introduction to Event horizon gives a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the term, which I'll try to fix.  The cosmological use is however mentioned in Event horizon#Event horizon of the observable universe.  There are more details in Cosmological horizon and Particle horizon.

On 8 April 2008 a European Hearing entitled """"crimes committed by totalitarian regimes"""" took place in Brussels. This was organised jointly by the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission around the two key issues of recognition of the crimes and reconciliation. 

The aim of the Hearing was to contribute to attaining a greater knowledge of these complex issues and to enable an exchange of views between independent experts, representatives of national institutes and NGOs dealing with these issues. 

Member States, Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Council of Europe were also present.

Arbitrary break for my reply
but if we really can't say that with our own experience from watching the show then we should remove the rest of """"such and such is based off of the character such and such from the original version"""" (at least for every character but the main three, maybe)

You're totally right with this, and I hadn't noticed that this was noted for other characters.  For now we should pull it. But I think eventually we'll see reviews and interviews noting the comparisons we've made.   But unfortunately, per the  original research policy we can't make those statements based on our own observations.  It's really frustrating sometime when something is so obvious but it prevents more problems than it causes.  Keeping the main three shouldn't be an issue; the show runners have talked about the one-to-one comparison to their UK counterparts in interviews.  It's something I've been meaning to go looking for (the articles where they've talked about how they are similar and different from the originals) but haven't had a chance to do yet.  This sort of thing is always an issue on list of character articles -  they tend to get updated with plot summary and very little else.  But as the show progresses there will be more material to drop in so that the article isn't so in-universe and has more real world info.

But would you still remove my edits if I added that information to the casting section?

If we can find the links to back up the comparisons, absolutely not.  I think it will be great info to provide once we have our sources.  It's exactly the kind of thhing I mean by real world info (casting the roles, how they are changed from originals by creators, how actors interpret the scenes and characters).  

Actually what I gave in my first reply wasn't plot summaries, but character summaries. 

That was actually a reference to an edit that came after yours.  Someone added waaay too much plot detail in there and I was reverting past two people's edits.  Since the lines for our edit summaries are so short, I find it hard to be clear about that sometimes.  

And while unsourced original research, it was from my experience of watching every season and  episode of the UK show so far and doing the same pretty much with the American one. I hate things like this where it's true but you have a hard time finding something that confirms it's true due to Wikipedia's standards. 

I know exactly what you mean.  It drives me bonkers sometimes.  I like to drove myself nuts last year looking for this little bit I remembered from an interview about an actor on True Blood.  But it really does prevent more problems than it causes.  Imagine if every person who had an off the wall interpretation of a scene came in and said """"well this bit reminded me of this thing in another thing so clearly the other thing was an inspiration.""""  

No need to make this personal. But if I really did come across that way I'm sorry, because I didn't mean to.

Not personal at all; no worries.  I just figured you undid before you saw  my reply to you here.  My edit summary probably seemed more blunt than I meant it because, again, trying to explain the reversion of more than one edit.  And I do waaay too much recent changes patrolling which seems to lead to a severe truncating of verbage in edit summaries.  I probably seem like a stark raving butthead half the time when I'm just trying to be brief.  I think you have great instincts about the type of stuff we'll want to include on the article.  We just have to find the articles to back up the info.  There's not going to be a lot out there yet because it's the first season but it'll be awesome if we can start getting the article overhauled with this kind of stuff right away.  I follow the UK version's article and a few other list of character articles that have been going on for years with just updates to plot summary and no real world stuff.  So now it's particularly overwhelming a thought to try and fix them.  The True Blood characters page is my personal nightmare.  I'll get around to it?

One thing I've been looking for is an article I read just before the premiere that talked about changes made to the three main characters.  I vaguely recall that it had some quotes from the writers and a couple of the actors (I think Witwer mentioned something about watching the UK version).  I can't seem to dig up the link from the message boards where I read about the show though.  Ack.""",0

 Official Notice 

I am posting this here, per WP:ADMINABUSE, as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question. I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me. However, as a matter of principle, I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right, even though it would be much easier to just drop this, and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success. I realize that to err is human. I'm not looking for your head on a platter. I'm not even looking for an apology. I too, am human, and far from perfect. In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I """"should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus"""" on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations """"should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion."""" My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me.

"Donald Campbell and File:Donald Campbell.jpg 

Hi Katie, I'd like to request an undelete on your recent deletion of this image (WP:CSD#F7). This is for two reasons:
 It's the masthead, and only, image of a biography on an important motorsport and motorboat figure. Our precedent is clearly that such images are considered to fall under fair-use. If the FUR wasn't up to scratch on the image, then WP:BEFORE clearly indicates that the FUR should be fixed, not the image deleted. I've seen an awful lot of these lately - images uploaded a few years ago (so probably the more important images) with FUR that was adequate at their time of upload are being purged because they don't meet todays practice, even though it's a trivial filing exercise to bring them up to standard. This hurts the encyclopedia project.
 Secondly, it wasn't notified anywhere on the article. There are templates for notifying this on the page, there's a talk: page too. Many people, myself included, have articles like this on their watch lists but we don't have every constituent image watched. Now whilst policy doesn't demand this, it would clearly be a helpful and appropriate action to place some notification onto the article, especially when it's the masthead that's under threat.

If Kansas Citywhich is at the same latitude as Russellis classified as humid continental, there is no earthly reason why Russell, which is nearly five derees farther WEST in longitude can be humid subtropical.",1

 New 2012 study by Mark Regnerus, sociology professor at the University of Texas 

A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy """"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships"""" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.

Due to the findings, it is very controversial, and that is why my edit here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality_and_psychology&diff;=497579176&oldid;=497039907 and here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LGBT_parenting&diff;=497585303&oldid;=497583187 has been undone, simply because another user disagreed and claimed the study is: """"widely criticized and flawed."""" Criticized by whom? It is a new study, nobody had yet written an article debunking it. Flawed according to whom? Your personal opinion? That is not a reason to vandalise the article and undo my edit.

 Hs Khalsa Recommendations 

I have several suggestions for how the Sikhism page can be improved.  I plan to list them below, one at a time, allowing time for comment on them before making the relevant changes.  After a suggestion has been considered and approved or rejected, I will move on to my next suggestion.

1)  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus and the select works of fifteen earlier bhagats as scripted in the Gurū Granth Sahib.""""

Problem: I feel this sentence is misleading.  As you know, the writings of only six Gurus are included in Guru Granth Sahib.  Perhaps this sentence is not meant to suggest that all ten Gurus are included.  However, a second issue arises because there are more authors than just fifteen bhagats included in Guru Granth Sahib as implied by the second part of the sentence.  

Solution:  """"The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten (lowercase 'T') Sikh Gurus, as well as (no 'the') Guru Granth Sahib which includes select works of numerous authors from diverse backgrounds.""""

If this is not detailed enough, perhaps all relevant authors could be listed.  In any case, just stating """"fifteen earlier bhagats"""" is factually incorrect.  Further, the emphasis of the Gurus was not on the background of the authors, but on what they had to say about God.

I also propose removing 'the' from in front of Guru Granth Sahib.  Guru Granth Sahib is not a thing.  It is not acceptable or appropriate to call Guru Nanak Dev - the Guru Nanak, or to call Guru Gobind Singh - the Guru Gobind.  Similarly, Guru Granth Sahib is a Guru of equal stature.  I know writing """"the Guru Granth Sahib"""" is extremely prevalent all over the Web, but we at Wikipedia should consider the merits of the case and hold ourselves to higher standards rather than just going with what is most popular.

BECK: OK. Dr. Paul, I`m going to take a break. And in the break, I`m going to feed something down to your location that I`m not going to show on the air. My life has been threatened. I`ve had to wear a vest and have securities. I`ve had an S.W.A.T. team watch my family because of people who say they support you. I want to show you something that is out on the Internet about me and from people that say they support you. And I want to get your thoughts on this, and let`s set to rest some things when we come back. Shall we? 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECK: We`re back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who is joining us tonight for a full hour. I want to make this very clear. I believe that Ron Paul, in general, the group of supporters, some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road, are amazing people. Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term """"The Ron Paul Revolution."""" They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million. But the downside is, when you have rabid supporters, some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name. And I just in the break showed Dr. Paul just a clip, a very small part of a five- minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed.

This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted.

Please read the relevant guideline, which is WP:EL.  Basically, there is no way to add that link.  We are not a linking site.  The only way that link could possibly appear would be if Dedalo were itself notable enough for an article.  This would only be if Dedalo had been discussed, several times, significantly, in reliable, independent sources.  So, if there are news articles or trade journals that discuss Dedalo (please note that press releases don't count), then we could consider making an article on Dedalo. If Dedalo does not rise to that level of importance, then it's somewhat possible that there could be a discussion of """"software used for ICH"""" in the ICH article.

You'll still need at least one reference in a reliable source to include the info, and you will not be able to add a direct link to the Dedalo website.

In the post-Reconstruction, pre-WWI United States, the """"N-word"""" was far less transgressive than it is today.
That particular word has undergone such a dramatic reduction in social acceptability that it must be presented within context, if at all.
This isn't because of the word's offensiveness to modern sensibilities per se; it's because twenty-first century readers would not understand its use as a nickname for a white man and would have no point of reference for how it would become a badge of honor to him.  Context must be provided or else it is shocking and misleading rather than informative.
It may not be possible or necessary to contextualize that moniker adequately within the bounds of WP:NPOV, specifically WP:UNDUE.  The nickname is a minor part of Pershing's life and career.  A similar nickname in Irving Berlin's biographical background has more than twice the returns on Google Books, yet is not mentioned in his Wikipedia biography.

"aesthetics 
From the 1911 Britanica Encyclopedia:

Greek Speculations
Ancient Greece supolies us with 
the first important contributions to aesthetic theory, 
though these are scarcely, in quality or in quantity, what 
one might nave expected from a people which had so high an 
appreciation of beauty and so strong a bent for philosophic 
speculation.  The first Greek thinker of whose views on the 
subject we really know something is Socrates.  We learn from 
Xenophon's account of him that he regarded the beautiful as 
coincident with the good, and both of them are resolvable 
into the useful.  Every beautiful object is so called because 
it serves came rational end, whether the security or the 
gratification of man.  Socrates appears to have attached 
little importance to the immediate gratification which a 
beauriful object affords to perception and contemplation, 
but to have emphasized rather its power of furthering the 
more necessary ends of life.  The really valuable point in 
his doctrine is the relativity of beauty.  Unlike Plato, 
he recognized no self-beauty (auto to kalon) existing 
absolutely and out of all relation to a percipient mind. 

Plato

Of the views of Plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult 
to gain a clear conception from the Dialogues, than it is in 
the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions 
of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic 
Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind 
leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, 
which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-exisiing 
forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an 
attribute in another thing, for these nre only beautiful things, 
not the beautiful itself.  Love (Eros) produces aspiration 
towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the 
self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal 
existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty 
reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an 
absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion 
of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, 
to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends 
to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the 
true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula 
kalokagathia. So far as his writings embody the notion of 
any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, 
harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in 
its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of 
colour.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and 
seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to 
be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful 
body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a 
trick of imitation (mimesis) which takes us another step 
farther from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into 
the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, 
in his scheme for an ideal republic, he provided for the most 
inexorable censorship of poets, &c.;, so as to make art as far 
as possible an instrument of moral and political training. 

Aristotle

Aristotle proceeded to a more serious investigation of the 
aesthetic phenomena so as to develop by scientific analysis 
certain principles of beauty and art.  In his treatises on 
poetry and rhetoric he gives us, along with a theory of these 
arts, certain general principles of beauty; and scattered among 
his other writings we find many valuable suggestions on the same 
subject.  He seeks (in the Metaphysics) to distinguish the 
good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in 
action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless 
things as well (`en akinetois.) At the same time he had 
as a Greek to allow that though essentially different things 
the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful.  
He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in 
a passage of the Politics set beauty above the useful and 
necessary.  He helped to determine another characteristic 
of the beautiful, the absence of all lust or desire in the 
pleasure it bestows.  The universal elements of beauty, 
again, Aristotle finds (in the Metaphysics) to be order 
(taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to 
orismenon).  In the Poetics he adds another essential, 
namely, a certain magnitude; it being desir",0

 Basques and more... 

If anybody knows why Claret is also called Bordeaux and is so popular in England, then perhaps we should include Basques (e.g. Piers Gaveston).  Basques entered English society at the same historic time as the Irish.  I also find it odd that Normans should get monolithic mention, without Brittany.  The Duchy of Brittany was a feudal subdomain of English Kings from the Norman Conquest until the 16th Century, in one capacity or another.  Aside from that, we all know the British (Welsh) connection that practically makes them who they are by definition.  Saint-Pierre and Miquelon has a flag and coat of arms which match English ethnic cousins on the Continent, because virtually all of New France was founded by those """"Frenchmen"""" once under English yoke (north and west coasts of """"France"""").  England's arms supposedly include Aquitaine and Gascony as well as the well-known Normandy.

IMHO:

Normandy has best ethnic transferance with England.  Both Scandinavian.
Brittany has best ethnic transferance with Wales.  Both Romano-Briton.
Aquitaine and Gascony has best ethnic transferance with Ireland.  Celtic/Basque connexions (hmm, Queen Mary's marriage with Spain).

All of these domains were of great post-Conquest importance, with added Scotland under Stuarts.  The union of the crowns under James (after the Tudor-Habsburg struggle) marked the divergence of a merely English people and it is from there, that a new British people was formed with participation in the Dutch and German dominions.  As far as I know and now think, the new """"British people"""" is mostly a network of upper class/parliamentary aristocrats and their personal heritage.

I am proud to sport a 1/8th Aquitainian/Poitevin (although Huguenot) ancestor.  I don't know further genealogy to find a recent Parisian (non-London) French (what is called France, but has English character) ancestor.  You know what side this ancestor would have fought on if Buckingham's war with France got serious.  This opens up a window to the past glories of the Angevin Empire for me because although I sport a Scottish colonial American wife, my own specific heritage does not leave the bounds of the three leopards of the Plantagenet dominions.

What some people should look at, is the French Wars of Religion maps.  Huguenots are numerous in Aquitaine/Gascony and Toulouse, both former Angevin areas.  One wonders if this Protestantism is an Albigensian Crusade relic, an Arian Visigothic vs Catholic Frankish relic or both combined with a culture of English resistance to the Capetians.

Also, if mentioning the Danes we shouldn't neglect the Norwegians.  I think the Royal Website summarizes our English ethnic roots by explaining them dynastically and the personal unions that encouraged a compatible mix of people.  That is why I believe the """"French people"""" are reasonably well related; to nitpick or split hairs on it is just ridiculous.

1.This user undid my edit, with an edit summary 'no I don't think so' which seems to breach WP:ESDONTS namely don't 'Make snide comments' or 'Be aggressive' 2.I tried to discuss at User talk:Cassianto but the user was again rather condescending and seemed to be ganging up on me with other users he already knows 3.When discussion began on at Talk:Moors murders, I simply put 'I think it is notable enough for a single line' - however, Cassianto replied 'Then you need to look up the definition of """"notable"""", clearly.'

I was not rude to the editor, but I was treated in a condescending and arrogant manner over a very minor matter

The user then preceded to launch a very abusive and malicious attack on me. He linked my 710 contributions [166] and entirely falsely wrote 'Not so ridiculous when you look at his contributions which seem to be all geared around the May elections. This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith. Examples: List of European Union member states by GDP growth and Mr Galloway Goes to Washington. I have successfully nominated dozens of articles for speedy deletion. As a new editor, I am deeply upset by how hard it is to edit this site without abuse and being treated like a moron (WP:BITE). It certainly is not encouraging for those wanting to make a difference in good faith.
Nothing at WP:SPA points to me. 5.The editor has breached multiple policies.

Editor still going. He has written now 'What makes you think I give a fuck about your political leanings?' (despite questioning them) and removed the ANI notification remarking 'what a waste of time'. What is the point of WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:NPA, WP:BITE?

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth.

I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.

I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a """"gut feeling"""" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of """"pattern"""" and bet based off of that, on the """"gut feeling"""" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any """"patterns"""" is purely coincidental.  """,0
"""Giambigarchy ==

Born on January 8, 1971 in West Covina California was a man who would grow to become a giant in the game of baseball. [|Jason Giambi]would move to the New York Yankees after winning the MVP award in 2001 with the Oakland Athletics. There he would never truly live up to his potential, until the year of our lord 2008. Going into the 2008 season that New York Yankees had a positive outlook returning countless all-star veterans, including [|Giambi], mixed with a crop of young talent not seen in the Yankee farm system in years. As the season progressed the Yankees did not reach the expectations of themselves, fans, and the entire front office. As the Yankees stumbled along, one of the bright spots was the fairly consistent play of [|Jason Giambi]. Minimal expectations had been placed upon him for the year, and his contributions had been important to the team staying above .500. With his fan popularity growing, he decided to try something that some may call ugly, but others may call the pinnacle of a potential religious or governmental view. As the fans and himself refer to it as, """"the stache"""", it has become an icon for not only [|Giambi], but the entire Yankee team. With other players such as Andy Pettite and Johnny Damon joining [|Giambi] with the facial hair, than shaving away, it was clear that this simple patch of lip fur was here to stay. Despite some claims that """"Just For Men"""" has been involved in the increasing color and thickness of said """"stache"""", there have been no official remarks from [|Giambi]. The infusion of the """"stache"""" into the everyday life of Yankee fans has formed the potential for a governmental ideology, justly named the Giambigarchy. It is a simple view which includes drinking plenty of beer, and growing incredible upper lip fur. A view that may conflict with the current Republican/Democratic debate for the upcoming election, but surely a view that would not start any wars in Iraq, or drive gasoline prices over $4.00/gallon. We of the Giambigarchy way of view encourage you took to take a long look at your own """"stache"""" and ask, """"Do I represent myself the way [|Jason Giambi] and his facial attributes do?"""" That is the only question required for acceptance of the Giambigarchy point of view, and we recommend any fan ask themselves that question. The governmental form under the Giambigarchy is a very open-minded yet structured form that allows for the basic freedoms of its followers, and party members, yet remains an extremely fun-loving and positive outlook on life that other religions, and governments have failed to achieve. The savior [|Jason Giambi] has led by example to bring together his followers, encouraging them to live their lives with what is referred to as """"stassion"""". This is a twist on passion, as of course one must dawn the proverbial mustache. This very close knit, and increasingly popular group has reached a new way of life, and the numbers of proud followers are completely staggering. Established in May of 2008, Giambigarchy registered members have reached to a total of 13,422 (as of July 5th, 2008).

"Sorry for not replying, MH - I did not see anything further I could say there that would advance towards a solution. My concern with the RfC title could, of course, have been solved by retitling it, but that would not solve the issue that the discussion was focused on editor behavior rather than improvements to the article. Based on the comments to the AN/I where I requested review of my early close and to the talkpage discussion it spawned, I think it might have been better to retitle, collapse the sniping, and attempt to focus the discussion based on the few remaining comments.

Several editors there have expressed concerns with the MedCab process, so Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment (perhaps after creating a dedicated taskforce) would seem a good place to discuss organization of the whole family of articles, and RfC/U or ArbCom would be good for discussing editor conduct. There have already been a number of RS/N, NPOV/N, and BLP/N discussions of related issues that could probably be exhumed for background. I have some hope, though, that the recent infusion of fresh blood might work out a solution without escalation.

In Delhi, diplomatic sources in the Chinese embassy said, 

As a side note, India needs to take more consideration of external threats. And it seems naive to think that India can continue to develop as a global economic power without also bringing its defence capabilities up to the standards of other nations in the region. From our POV it seems poverty should be their priority, but the UK, US etc all have poverty and still spend billions on effective defence measures.

{{Mergeto|Watercraft|date=November 2009}}

Can watercraft be merged with boat in order to simplify the articles (boat, boating, ship, watercraft) and provide a more clear article (with 1 meaning for each) ?

Is this a case where I could update the page and then have it examined for potential contravention of policy? Better to get approval for such action first rather than after the fact! Thanks for ant help

Were Michael's mind open to rational persuasion, he would have yielded on this long before. His objection is, at this point, ideological. More examples will not convince him.  That we all get things wrong at times is easy to see. What is more difficult to understand is why we get things wrong, and why we persist in error.  On the Israeli/Jewish side of this common problem, there are two elements, one cultural, one a matter of the politics of image-forging to win a global consensus by affecting the way events and history are perceived. I think Michael's error is to be classified in the former, which is basically rooted in a long tradition of thinking in terms of Jewish exceptionalism, and therefore any analogies that may arise from the kind of descriptive language used to characterise Palestinian realities that might remind one of similar Jewish realities, is repressed. Michael dislikes 'uprising' because there is the possibility that it might create a subliminal nexus with the Warsaw uprising. There is a deeper analogy. The Romans crushed Bar Kochba's revolt (which in the historical literature is often described as an 'uprising'), and under Hadrian set out to Romanize Judea. The creation of Israel vindicates Bar Kochba, but also, in rejudaising Palestine, creates an implicit structural analogy between the fanatic resistance of Bar Kochba, and the PLO/Hamas/the Al-Aqsa type violence, esp.sacred violence in the name of national restoration. This analogy is naturally repugnant to a cast of mind rooted in the myths of Jewish exceptionalism, since those who evoke the myth of Masada must at the same time war down a native people who are battling from the redoubts of their rocky bantustans against the judaisation of their native and sacred territory, very much as Bar Kochba himself did. Rabbinical schools after the failure of Bar Kochba developed a doctrine of submission to foreign states, one which lasted until the creation of Israel redeemed the earlier foundational myths of the Book of Joshua, and dispelled cringing by recurring to the heroic militancy of the first invasion of Canaan. Ironically, what is expected of Palestinians is that they cringe before the power of Israel's occupation: any phenomenon bearing a generic resemblance to the sicarii, or zealotism, is dismissed as an appalling 'Arab cultural trait': though in fact it resonates, mutatis mutandis, with analogies from Jewish history under the Roman empire from Titus to Hadrian, where militant fanaticism and zealotism in the name of national autonomy flourished. The early Zionists from Jabotinsky to Ben-Gurion to Moshe Dayan and Menachem Begin were perfectly aware that their policies bore these ironic resonances.  Being thorough realists, they didn't have to kid themselves. Today we live in the fog of public opinion myths, where these ironical analogies are elided from consciousness. People are raised on the standard clichés, endlessly recycled by hasbara machines, and underwrite them sincerely, because they no longer have much of a sense of history. Much could be said of this. But this is not the place.Regards",0

We also have a large number of scorers when compared with this stage in previous years.  was the first competitor to score this year, as he was last year, with a detailed good article review. Some other firsts:

 was the first to score for a did you know, with Marquis Flowers.
 was the first to score for an in the news, with 2013 Houphouët-Boigny stampede.
 was the first to score for a featured list, with list of Billboard Social 50 number-one artists.
 was the first to score for a featured picture, with File:Thure de Thulstrup - L. Prang and Co. - Battle of Gettysburg - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg.

Featured articles, portals and topics, as well as good topics, are yet to feature in the competition.

This year, the bonus points system has been reworked, with bonus points on offer for old articles prepared for did you know, and """"multiplier"""" points reworked to become more linear. For details, please see Wikipedia:WikiCup/Scoring. There have been some teething problems as the bot has worked its way around the new system, but issues should mostly be ironed out- please report any problems to the WikiCup talk page. Here are some participants worthy of note with regards to the bonus points:

 was the first to score bonus points, with Portland-class cruiser, a good article.
 has the highest overall bonus points, as well as the highest scoring article, thanks to his work on Enrico Fermi, now a good article. The biography of such a significant figure to the history of science warrants nearly five times the normal score.
 claimed bonus points for René Vautier and Nicolas de Fer, articles that did not exist on the English Wikipedia at the start of the year; a first for the WikiCup. The articles were eligible for bonus points because of fact they were both covered on a number of other Wikipedias.

Also, a quick mention of , who may well have already written the oddest article of the WikiCup this year: did you know that the Fucking mayor objected to Fucking Hell on the grounds that there was no Fucking brewery? The gauntlet has been thrown down; can anyone beat it?

 Bias and Errors 

This articles makes it appear that the shalwar qamiz is mainly a womens dress. It gives two paragraphs on how women wear the shalwar qamiz, but only mentions in passing that men wear it also.
""""In Bangladesh, India and Pakistan one simply visits the local tailor and has a salwar suit made to order."""" This is not completely true as many people buy ready made shalwar qamiz. This once again shows bias as its mostly women that go to the tailor and have it made, while men just purchase it in the store.
Afghanistan - even if you disagreed with the spelling why did you remove that it is the national dress of Afghanistan.
As for spelling does anyone disagree with the fact that the Central Asians(Turkmen, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz) called it shalwar. It doesnt matter that salwar gets more google hits. More people call pashtuns pathans but that doesnt really mean anything. Putting it as 'Shalwar Kameez' is a comprimise between (the correct spelling) shalwar qamiz, and salwar kameez.""",0

Bullshit. """"His corkscrew senton finisher hasn't been called the Cancun Tornado"""". Why the fuck would you argue if you don't have your facts straight? Watch iDia de los Dangerous!, I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event. The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesn't matter. For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name.

The awful truth about Wikipedia

This page is rather a good example of how a good page can be turned into a bad one by a series of foolish edits. There never was a justification for merging Japanese and Chinese together on one page, and I should have realised from the beginning that this piggybacking of the Chinese contents onto the Japanese language page was a stupid mistake. Successive edits have rendered the page less and less readable, and the recent idiotic decision to merge the information on Chinese and Japanese punctuation, as well as the rewriting of a section which was originally entirely about Japanese into something which seems to be entirely about Chinese yet again indicates the carelessness and foolishness of very many so-called Wikipedians. I recently looked at the page about """"only write about what you know"""" to find that it has been removed - Wikipedia, it seems, must be saddled with the efforts of illiterates and people who do not know what they are talking about. If I was actively involved in editing this encyclopedia, on the strength of the recent idiotic series of edits, I would revert out the Chinese language information and rename the page back to """"yokogaki and tategaki"""". It used to be a good, well written, informative page. Now it is a mish-mash of badly written, confusing crud. Unfortunately what happened to this article is not an isolated example but an all-too-typical example of what """"Wikipedians"""" seem to achieve - degeneration of article quality.

 High Tech Postcode Recommended 

An Irish Cross Party Parliamentary (Oireachtas) Committee has recommended the implementation of a unique Identifier Postcode  for Ireland according to """"The Post Codes Report"""" as reflected in the Irish Examiner. The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.

The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D04 123 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.

The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 31 March 2010 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals

Late on 1st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..

Serbian casualties again

Just one link more, to the already existing ones numbered above: http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199711/71128-026-trae-beo.htm 
It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll (in battles- civilian Serbian casualties are, as usual, inflated beyond & beyond..). The reason ? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self-image of a Ramboid nation); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone's national sensibilities aside-it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8.000.  

The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica (a typical Croatian name) so it again represents a Croatian press POV.

Here's another nice example of nationalist logic. What you're basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian, is that it? Infact, you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man's NAME. What if he changed his name, maybe he would be more neutral then, what do you think?  

Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10.000.
According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2,300., and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that """"most experts agree with the figure"""". 
There are no reason to put 8.000 or 10.000 as official data. These data are contraversial. 
Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10.000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book """"Bitka za Vukovar"""", put the highest limit around 12.000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say-exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is not deaf, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus's estimates. It is explicit. Therefore, reverted.  

I've seen this later

It's not just the number of Serbian military casualties (after all, these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse). It's this sick worldview prevalent in some Serbian circles: Croatian paramilitaries, secession, liberation of Vukovar,...then liberation of Srebrenica, faked Markala, lies about everything and everyone (for those conversant with Croatian, just a slice: http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/dedijer.htm#kraj%20mita).

"This is the armeniapedia version about the battle

In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  

First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article.

 Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title """"Humanistic Buddhism"""" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into """"Buddhist Humanism"""". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term """"Buddhist Humanism"""" is appropriate. 

 Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.

Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: """"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community"""" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html

 Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the Lotus Sutra: “Buddhist humanism:  It is a philosophical perspective that reflects the core spirit of the Lotus Sutra”
Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html

 I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as """"Chinese"""" Buddhism and """"Japanese"""" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing """"passport"""" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. 

 Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity.

 * * 

Another worthy editor, with whom I disagree about his recent editing of what I first wrote six months ago actually gives the best evidence that clarification of the word uphold is appropriate (if not in fact needed) in this article.

As you can read above, he states on this discussion page[] that no clarification of the word “uphold” is needed because it is such a simple word (he says “If people are smart enough to access Wikipedia, they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word. I'm willing to concede all of your other points, but I will continue to revert your changes if you insist on adding the word approved  twice, no less  to clarify the elementary word """"uphold"""" [emphasis added]). 

Yet, even this intelligent and well-expressed editor was confused as to the meaning. When he first edited (by removing “(approved)” as a clarification of the word “upheld”), he did so NOT because it was a commonly understood word that was incapable of being misunderstood, as he now says it is. No, his reason was the complete opposite. He changed it because, at that time, he misunderstood the meaning of the word. In his own explanation of the edit (on the revision history page [] for this article)[] he wrote his reason for removing the word “approved,” stating on December 23 the following “21:20, 23 December 2009  (upholding is different from approving [emphasis added]).”[]

He changed it because he thought the words had different meanings. He understands now, but has [briefly, no doubt, as can we all] forgotten that people, as did he, can misunderstand these terms. He is also correct that I did put that clarification twice. I did so because it seemed appropriate when I sought to present the information in a suitably short, yet accurate, fashion. However, it is rather obvious that even twice isn’t enough clarification for every time that every reader reads something. This is true for us all, even editors who take of their own time in an effort to improve Wikipedia articles.

The other editor says “If people are smart enough to access Wikipedia, they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word.” I disagree. Respectfully, even intelligent editors can, and this instance, did misunderstand what they thought was an incredibly common and elementary word such as “upheld.” Please understand that this is not a personal attack in any way, and that everyone’s opinion and thoughtful efforts at editing are valuable. It’s just that the circumstances are that the very person who now says that the clarification is so completely inappropriate here that he will continue to remove such clarification every time in the future that it is restored, is the same person who originally took out the explanation - not because it wasn’t needed, but rather, because he didn’t himself understand what the term meant. We are all human. We are all learning.

The other editor is hardly alone in being human. The reason that I could quickly find so many examples of clarification of the same term, coincidently done in the same manner, is that the term (upheld) is worth using (it has a precise meaning, especially to those in the legal field), but it i",0

 Thoughts on a """"high school"""" A7 

As I am, of course, well aware following my RfA, CSD A7 explicitly exempts schools.  Do you believe that it applies to """"online"""" schools; specifically, Denver Online High School?  I just removed the speedy deletion template, though I'm not really sure it qualifies for the exception.  Looking at their webpage (just added as an EL to the article), it looks like they probably are real, and seem at least somewhat connected to the Denver public school system (though they also seem to charge fees, which confuses me).  If the are operated by the State, then they probably even meet the general """"All high schools are automatically notable"""" AfD exemption.  

Obviously, the article needs clean-up, but I'd rather wait and see if it should even be an article before doing so.   
This is indeed  a public school, though private high schools are just as notable as public ones. (I don't see a mention of fees, but most public schools do collect some sort of fee, and almost all charge tuition to students from outside their district.) The article however was totally unacceptablemainly devoted to the names of the teachers. I removed that, but there is still much necessary rewriting.  The real question for an online school at this or any level  would be whether it is actually a separate school, or merely a programwe cannot necessarily go by the name it calls itself. If a program, it would best go in the article for the Denver Board of Education. My feeling is that it an actual  separate school, but for something like this, a 3rd party reference will be really helpful.  What it clearly is not is a mere tutoring center or support facility, which are almost never notable.   ' ( talk ) 
That all sounds very reasonable to me; I figured erring on the side of caution (removing the A7) was the better choice.  Thanks for the trimming; I'll go take a look and see if I can find any sort of third party sources.    

 Notability of high schools 

Hi  I hope you have been well.  I seem to recall, and have stated (or mis-stated, as the case may be) that I thought you may have said in the past that (verifiable) high schools are generally presumptively notable.  But, in the event I've mis-spoken as to what you said, feel free to correct me.  I made mention of my recollections at an AfD where I've not myself !voted (as of yet), here:  Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mesivta Tiferes Yisroel.  Best.  
such is the accepted compromise: high schools have articles, elementary schools in the absence of special notability get merged. But the compromise , like all informal and formal Wikipedia rules, has effect only as long as people here want it to have effect. I think recent decisions have upheld this in general, but there are always one or two people who challenge it. Such is probably the case here,There may be other factors, though, which I mention them at the AfD. ' ( talk ) 

Inherent notability for elementary schools which have been """"Blue Ribbon Schools""""
I am contacting you because you participated in either the AFD Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in a redirect or the deletion review Wikipedia:Deletion review#Kennedy Middle School (Cupertino, California) which resulted in restoration of the article because it was once a """"Blue Ribbon School"""". I have opened a discussion at Wikipedia talk:Notability (organizations and companies)#US elementary schools: Inherent notability: for """"Blue Ribbon Schools"""" as to whether the 5200 schools which have been found awarded the """"Blue Ribbon"""" seal of approval get inherent notability, or if they each have to satisfy WP:ORG via significant coverage in multiple reliable and independent sources. Your input is welcome. Thanks!    
P.S. Should I have made this a """"RFC?"""" I rarely get involved in such general policy forums.   
the way we've been doing it recently, it would best be to be made an RfC. But it should not be worded """"inherent notability """" but """"presumption of notability"""", and, personally, though I care relatively little for these articles one way or anot",0

 Suggesion for a more compact grid 

I'd like to propose a new grid format for the income inequality list. I've uploaded a screenshot here. By combining the UN/CIA """"R/P 10%"""" columns and the World Bank/CIA/GPI """"Gini index"""" columns, and by writing the years directly besides the values, we can make this grid much more readable. Of course, one could not sort by year anymore, but I don't think this is such an issue. Whichever source (UN, CIA, WB, GPI) has the latest value, that source's data should be displayed. I don't see a need for displaying different sources, since they probably all calculate those indices using the same data.

My point is that the scientists considered for representing the entire scientific population, groups 1-3 from above, are not a representative sample.  Therefore it is not appropriate to make the """"small minority of scientists"""" claim.  The only accurate way to assess the opinions of a large group of scientists is to poll them, as every researcher does not necessarily believe every word in a study they participate in.

 Maybe the larger question is this: what do scientist's opinions matter? They don't get paid to have opinions, but to do objective research.  Let's talk about the results.  Of course I think it's acceptable to have opinion-based articles that are separate from the main GW article, such as Scientific opinion on climate change and List of scientists opposing global warming consensus.

"The Bereans 

I did some research and I have to agree with you that it is only this Bereans website that is openly labelling Soriano's group as a cult. Who are these Bereans anyway? They are completely unnotable and I am yet to encounter anyone who actually belongs to this anti-cult group? Chances are they are also a cult group, or even a ghost religion (one that exists only in the Internet). I don't think that articles from the Bereans website qualify as reliable third-party published source as per WP:RS. If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags, we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month's time. It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias. Quotes should be either from notable newspapers, magazines and books (self-published books not included). As I will never use articles from Soriano's website(s) to criticize, say for example, the Baptist sect, I would also not use articles from a Baptist website to criticize Soriano's sect.

Well this is not true. The term pharaoh is not of greek origin but of egyptian origin, pr-3ˁ per-aa, meaning the great house. The term in fact refers to the palace of the king and came to used for the king's estate and finally for the king himself during the Saite period ca 650BC, well before the classical greco-roman times (starting ca 500BC). Thus the term pharaoh was used by ancient egyptian to refer to their king, albeit at a very point moment in history.

"I agree with Kamosuke on some points, however I still prefer Sir Edgar's version over Kamosuke's although not perfect.  I request Sir Edgar's version to be modified to mention Western influence before and under the sakoku policy.
Here are my thoughts in detail....  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.

 Moved from London Victory Parade discussion page 

As this exchange has nothing to do with the topic of the article and has everything to do with you assuming that I am editing in bad faith and trying to catch me out in a way which is quite frankly pathetic, I am moving it from that discussion page to your talk page.  

What is the title of the book you wrote about Warsaw, Varsovian? Do you know what """"M-ka"""" is ? You lived in Warsaw for ten years , you said above. Please tell me what M-ka is.  
Travellers Warsaw. Not only do I have no idea what M-ka is but my assistant (27 years old, born in Warsaw and lived here her whole life) and the professor in the office next to me (56 years old and spent entire life in Warsaw) have no idea what you're talking about either.  
What part of Warsaw you or your assistant lived in?  
I live in Muranow, she lives in Saska Kepa. Has this got anything to do with the London Victory Parade of 1946?  
Is this the book you wrote?..I'm sure the answer is in a very book you claim to write... Ask your assistant what is N24-rka then. I'm really trying hard to convince myself that you are a real account. Please help me. Thansk  
No, I wrote the second edition. And took about a quarter of the photos too. Why not buy a copy and read it from cover to cover: you will not find the words M-ka or N24-ka anywhere in it. However, you will find a rather good joke about Copernicus (or at least a good joke for anybody who knows their Monty Python).  
Well...if you lived in Warsaw and your assistant lived in Saska Kepa whole her life she would for sure knew what N24-rka is. It is the number of only night bus that goes to Saska Kepa. People in Warsaw or """"Varsovians"""" just know these things. I was born in Warsaw and I lived there for many years. Everybody knows buses and trams numbers especially in their areas. EVERYBODY. If you asked me what M-ka or N24-rka is I would tell you right away and even in the middle of the night. But thanks anyway Varsovian.  
You really are comedy gold! Firstly, to speak for myself I have no idea which night bus I would take to get home: I use these things called taxis. Secondly my assistant says that you are an idiot (although I would never use such incivil language to you). N24 does not go to Saska Kepa: it goes to Praga-Poludnie. To get to Saska Kepa she would take N72.  
Of course Varsovian...whatever you say[].  
Thank you for yet again implying that I am a liar. I do wonder if it is ever possible for you to actually be civil towards people. Thank you for your comments as to which bus goes where. I suggest that you contact ZTM (the Warsaw municipal transport company) and tell them that their website is completely wrong: they list the N24 as not going to Saska Kepa  and the N72 as going to Saska Kepa .

"""Please read discussion comments about the expert article on the get conflict below. 

:For the religious process,  see Get (divorce document) 

A 'get or ghet is a Jewish bill of divorce which is supervised by a Beth Din which is a rabbinical court in the city or jurisdiction where one lives. This page deals with the Conflict of Laws or civil law implications vs Judaic Law (religious law) when a women does not get her ghet and is kept in """"agunah"""" which means chained.http://www.icar.org.il For a discussion of the purely religious implications, see religious divorce.

Discussion
Jewish communities have maintained a strong desire for religious, cultural and economic autonomy. Jewish Law is administered and enforced Judaic Lawin Israel and in the Diaspora through Bet Dins (Houses of Judges) Judaic Law holds that the man must initiate the request for the Jewish Divorce (""""get"""")and the woman must agree to receive the (""""get"""").

The relationship between state and religion

Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in """"agunah"""". One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce (see Agunah). A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly, but the capacity to remarry is also religious question. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children, and for maintenance and property settlements. Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion (see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article  9(1) European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief).  The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law. Thus, for example, in Rhodesia, the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz (1956) (3) SA 522 (SR), held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts.

Nevertheless, the majority of Western states do, to some extent, make the secular court's response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms, so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement, or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed. 

Canada

In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:
place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;
encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and
maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. 
This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system.

"""Third party jumping into the fray:
 I disagree with John F. Lewis regarding his reasons for rejecting the AFC, but not with the outcome.  The article has plenty of references, some of which may well be reliable.  The fact that the references are not properly cited in the article is problematic, but it is a widespread problem throughout Wikipedia and hardly sufficient reason to reject an AFC submission.
 I have discussed this article at length with Itzcoatzin on his talk page and will reiterate my views here.  This article is not appropriate for Wikipedia because it is unfocused and overly broad.  It does not present a clear narrative of the progress of a family through history, but rather presents a scatter-shot of ideas, many of which are irrelevant to the Zambrano family history.  One may refer to the discussion at Itzcoatzin's talk page for a fuller understanding of the issues that have been discussed.

Many of the issues pointed out here are worthy of discussion. As a work in progress like the rest of Wikipedia, this article will be improved with time. A big problem for articles about religion in China (and popular or folk religion in particular) is that this (extremely vast and varied) field of research has received little attention in the West until recent times and most of its literary heritage has not been translated in Western languages (or has been mistranslated). There are also discrepancies in the Western and Chinese understanding of what is and what is not """"religious"""". Only recently Western and Chinese scholars are cooperating for a clearer analysis of Chinese folk (or popular) religion.
Regarding the style I have used in writing this article (for example the use of many notes, quotations, and the explanation of the different names of this religion or complex of religions), it is due to the complexity of the topic itself.

Hi.

I just finished reading your message and before I say anything, there are two things you need to clarify:
Is it an article or a stand-alone list? It can be both, but then it must satisfy the inclusion criteria for both; if I say """"it is overwhelming"""", that'd be a huge understatement. Personally, I think it is a list. I never made the mistake of thinking the only list is a bulleted or numbered list. Tables are, most of the times, lists; comparison tables are always lists.
Do you want to abide by the policies or do you want to ignore them? Make no mistake, I have heard the sentence """"writing a decent article"""" so much that I have no faith in it; if one hundredth of them were true, Wikipedia would have now been full of featured articles. So, I won't hold any value in it unless I see signs of it being true.

That said, yes, arguments like """"but this page is not a list of everything in the universe"""" in response to """"Wikipedia is not a directory of everything in the universe that exists"""" are so childish that I don't even give them the pleasure of handwaving them. And the fact that WP:NOT was once an essay doesn't make me think any less of it, let alone violate it; it is now a fundamental policy, so its original writer has my highest respects for writing such a popular thing. It says we are not a directory and that means a hybrid of directory is not allowed either.

More thoughts
Hi KW - I noticed this thread whilst I was on my wikibreak and since I didn't have sufficient time/internet access, I made a note to comment. Before I begin, I'd like to apologise for the accusation of harassment, whilst I was feeling harassed by your comments I believe I over reacted due to the off-wiki stress of moving house. With that agreement above, I'm hoping we can move on. I'm hoping to get RfA Reform wrapped up 2012, there's been some very good research done, a few very resonable proposals which will be brought to the community to decide on them (even if I don't personally agree with them). 
You mention above that the RfA Reform project is dead without an an article writer as a leader, though you and I disagree on what constitutes an article writer, I would love to see one of those names helping in the project - even as co-ordinator. However, since none of them has shown any interest in RfA Reform and they are all busy with other things, I'm not going to hold my breath. Please do feel free to nudge any of them though - I'm sure a comment from you would go down much better than one from me, since I haven't interacted with any particularly. 
As for the unsavoury behaviour towards editors, I am actively trying to minimise this. For example, Keepscases, I did much research into his questions in the last quarter of last year, who removed them, how they were answered and so on. I don't believe I published it on wiki, though I could dig it up for you. From that, I came to the conclusion that Keepscases questions were not a major issue - and discussed that with a few of the editors who had issues with that user. I don't believe there has been any comments regarding Keepscases since, though I know there are still editors who are unhappy with the questions at RfA.
Regarding Malleus Fatuorum, I do endorse a topic ban from discussing administrators, as I believe that would remove the majority of problems and would be a much better solution than a blunt instrument like a block. Unfortunately, that does mean also topic banning him from RfA, which is a pity because his votes generally appear to be well worded (it's the comment's outside the votes, and the comments at WT:RfA which are problematic). In any case, that's a personal opinion, which I've explained with evidence at the the ArbCom case. If ArbCom choose to disagree, I'm not going to persue that further. 
All in all, I'd love to see RfA Reform actually improve RfA - I'm not 100% it can, because of project wide failings, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try. I'm hoping to do some work improving the de-sysop process too, I'd like to see a more clear system there too. Finally, would you mind laying off the """"RfA Deform"""" comment? It belittles the project and only serves to make things more difficult, you are the only editor who uses that phrase - so I'd appreciate it if you could drop it.  · (talk) """,0

"Sinhalese Nagas 
It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha. Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island. Origins of the Hela Race. Hela was combination of Raksha, Yaksha, Deva, Naga. 

Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles,.. At the time of start writing the history, Raksha and Deva wasn't powerful. Naga was the most powerful authorities. That time only they had kingdoms. It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna. Others lived as small groups ( kuveni's story). 

Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya. After 2,3 generations from Pandukabhaya, kings tend to suffix 'Tissa' and 'Naga' to their names. Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe. There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe. This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms ( most probably Nagadeepa) made connections to the royal family in Rajarata. Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others. So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain Naga/Sinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule. But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata.  

It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king. Those days without having clear power king can't survive. Yaksha's had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya. But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families. Since conflicts between tribes hasn't been ended, Naga/Sinha king wasn't be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days. Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana. Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas. Ritigal Jayasena was one of them.

So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna. SL was unified on tribe basis. After SL was converted to buddhism it wasn't required to unify tribes which based on religion. Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism (due to fear for Asoka) Rajarata king could made his brother ( MahaNaga) as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance. So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas.",0

"That Austin Allegro pic 

I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model. You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

Biography and creativity
 
[edit] Early years
 
Viktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.
 
[edit] Star Factory
 
Alla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and added

In 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and """"Leila"""".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria's first video.
 
[edit] """"Post-factory"""" life
 
[edit] 2005—2006
 
After the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song """"Leila"""" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria's life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (""""Я просто сразу от тебя уйду"""") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (""""Хочешь, я тебе спою"""")
 
[edit] 2007
 
In the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming.
 
She was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007».
 
In the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted.
 
In 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was """"star"""", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places.
 
With Alexei, Vika wrote a song """"Needle"""", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours.
 
Also in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive».
 
[edit] 2008— present
 
On 6 March 2008 She released a debut album """"Needle"""". The album became «the collection of hits of the singer» as it was the first album for 3 years of work. Now Victoria begins work on the second album.

 Response to HJ Mitchells """"challenge"""" 

Since I am still blocked and cannot post this in response to HJ's challenge nor can I vote for the three candidates I do support, I will leave this here.
Hj Mitchell, please spare us the dramatics of, """"I'll quite if you give me a reason."""" No one here thinks you will quite regardless of any reasons given nor would you be expected too. You are also fully aware that no one is going to mine through your edits looking for wrongdoing. That's just a waste of time and you would likely retort with they are NOTHERE. What I will do, is give you a few examples of what I have seen over a very short span of time. Given a review of any say, month long period, I think we will find the same result within a few percentage points of the mean.
You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence. After reviewing the comment Protonk made, I certainly agree it was a bad comment, but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Fucking morons"""" because you were the submitter of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt. An event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for. Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit. 
You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt. This can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives.
As mentioned above, and as noted by several individuals, your Fucking morons''' comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary.
You recently unblocked  and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and trolling regarding gender topics and gamergate. Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks, has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned venues.
Even based on your comments here, you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else whats good for Wikipedia. That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary.
You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement. Personally, I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later. There is no way you scrutinized all those and I can easily see a lot of mistakes and preventing useful edits from being done through bad faith assumptions of guilt, similar to those you displayed towards me for criticizing your actions.
I could keep going, but that is enough IMO to show a pattern of conduct not appropriate of a functionary. 96.255.237.170  """,0

                          The Colour out of Space      

I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a yellow,hairy, five-clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulfme. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me thatit was Egypt. - HP Lovecraft

This is only a test

At 5:05 on November 22, 1977, regular television programming in southern England was interrupted by a voice claiming to be that of """"Grahama,"""" representative of the """"Ashtar Galactic Command,"""" bearing the usual """"space brother"""" boilerplate of coming in peace to save us from ouselves at the dawn of a New Age. It was quickly dismissed as a hoax, but an extremely complicated one to execute. 

Though the The Sunday Times the following December 4 surmised it was accomplished by students using just """"£80 worth of equipment powered by an ordinary car battery,"""" no one ever claimed responsibility, and independent investigations found that the message must have cut into at least five transmitters simultaneously,and it evaded detection by monitoring equipment which did not even register an interruption, """"suggesting it was achieved in some way that by passed our electrical system.""""

This was actually the second message from Grahama. A month earlier, he had said pointedly that """"We conveyed to Sir John Whitmore and to Dr. Puharich that we would interfere on your radio and television communication systems to relay when the civilisations are coming close to landing on your planet Earth. It is now in motion. We wish you to know that we love you.""""

That """"Grahama"""" would single out the aristocratic former racing champion Whitmore and parapsychologist and MKULTRA researcher Andrija Puharich suggests this was no simple hoax: both men were deeply involved with a decades'-long channelled communication with entities representing a universal hierarchy sometimes called the """"70 Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood."""" The entities governing our reality identified themselves The Nine.

Another link to Whitmore and Puharich was British author Stuart Holyroyd's recently published Prelude to the Landing on Planet Earth, which the two had commissioned as an account of their work with the Nine. In the book, Holroyd wrote that the Nine intended to “interrupt televisionand radio transmissions during the period 18th to 22nd November.”

Regarding the television interruptions, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince write in The Stargate Conspiracy that, """"as usual, there were only two options considered: either the wholething was genuine and extraterrestrials had really spoken to the southern English through their television sets; or it was hoax, just done for a laugh.The idea that such a message could be easily contrived by, for example, an intelligence agency that would have the necessary technical skills has never,to our knowledge, even been considered.""""

Of course there are several pages about me in that same book and I worked with Puharich for a short while.

This seems a bizarre oversight given the circumstantial connections to Whitmore and Puharich,and especially the latter's service in Army Intelligence and later as a CIA contractor researching the induction of altered states of consciousness.(Whitmore, incidentally, is now also Britain's """"number one business coach,"""" training top executives from companies such as Barclays, Lloyds, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Rolls Royce.) Uri Geller,for a time one of the Nine's channellers, told Picknett and Prince that """"the CIA brought Puharich in to come and get me out of Israel,"""" and in his essay In the Thick of It, physicist Jack Sarfatti writes that """"Puharich was Geller's case officer in America with money provided by Sir John Whitmore.""""

The Deep Space Nine

The """"Council of Nine"""" have been delivering curiously consistent messagesthrough a succession of mediums to influential patrons with names like DuPont, Astor and Bronfman since the early 1950s, and nearly always in the shadow of military intelligence.

 Some historical references to the story of the Janjua Rajputs / sitush stop fucking with our article you gay hindu  

'Some historical references to the story of the Janjua Rajputs...'Bold text.
Predating all that is related below, the Pandava ancestors of Janjuas were known historically for the great Mahabharata war in which Arjuna and his brothers were victorious after huge losses on both sides.

""""The Janjua Rajputs possess a proud Martial reputation and rank very highly as the aristocracy of the Salt Range. Their pride in their ancestry is renowned and are always addressed by their ancestral title of Raja."""" (Rawalpindi District Gazetteer Robertson, reprint 2001, Lahore, p105)

""""Their (Janjuas) exploits and reputation has earned them the regard as the most Valiant Kshatriyas (warlords) in the Punjab."""" (History of Mediaeval Hindu India by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, Cosmo Publ. 1979, p129) """"The tribal system of loyalty to the clan is still adhered, and they tend to only align with other tribes of equally high social rank and reputation."""" (The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia Gyanes Kudaisya, London 2000, p207) “The great Janjua tribe have retained their pride of lineage and their Rájput title, and can be ranked as Míán Sáhu or first class Rájpúts...physically well-looking, with fine hands and feet; much given to military service, especially in the cavalry;...poor agriculturists, with great pride of race and are always addressed as Raja” (Panjab Castes - Sir Denzil Ibbetson, reprint Delhi 2002, p149, p154)
""""The Janjua are famed as a restless and warlike Muslim Rājput tribe."""" (Imperial Gazetteer of Kashmir and Jammu, Sang e Meel, reprint 2002, p9, p34) and are """"doubtless pure Rājputs"""".(Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p152) & (The Indian Village Community by Baden Henry Baden-Powell, Adamant Media Corp. 2005, p97) The Janjuas Rajputs have been recognised in Punjabi history as a 'Martial clan' and the British also viewed them as excellent soldiers and distinguished them from other tribes as""""other tribes no way superior to them in courage or military skill"""". ('Punjab Chiefs' L.H.Griffin, 1909 Lahore, p215-7}. .
The ancestors of the Janjuas Rajputs , the last dynasty of the Janjua Shahis, were mentioned by Albiruni..""""as noble men of noble bearings...who always did what they said"""". Al-Biruni, despite living under Sultan Mahmud's grace, praises the house of Jayapala Janjua (10th Century AD): """"We must say that in all their grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of doing that which is good and right, that they were men of noble sentiment and noble bearing."""" Kalhana (13th Century AD) writes of the Janjua Shahis: """"Where is the Shahi dynasty with its ministers, its kings, and its great grandeur? ... The very name of the splendor of Shahi kings has vanished. What is not seen in dream, what even our imagination cannot conceive, that dynasty accomplished with ease"""".

The Tarikh-e-Alfi of the Ghorids (13th Century AD) mentions the rebellious behaviour of [1]Raja (Ajmal) Mal (est. d. 1230 AD) (son of Raja Dhrupat Dev of Mathura) towards the Delhi Sultanate. It records that a """"Rai Mal"""" of the mountains between Lahore and Kabul excited a rebellion against them and intercepted communications between Lahore and Ghazni. There is still today remnants of an ancient fort in Malot, Chakwal which was initially built by the Shahis and later rebuilt by Raja Mal Janjua. It is also inscribed that the last Hindu Shahi emperor Raja Mal embraced Islam at this place. Raja Mal was also the first ruler to begin the mining of salt in the Salt Ranges of Kallar Kahar and in the Khewra Salt Mines of Punjab which is currently the world's second largest salt mine. Many prominent Muslim tribes of Potohar Plateau in Pakistan trace their lineage back to the Janjuas through the five princes of the House of Raja Mal Janjua (13th Century AD). The five princes were: Raja Bhir Raja Jodh (est. d. 1259 AD) (ancestor of Chakri/Bajwala / Darapur Janjuas) Raja Kala Raja Tanoli Raja Khakha Jodh and Bhir were born of a Gakhar Rani while Kala, Khakha and Tanoli were born of another Rajput Rani. ('Journal of Central Asia', Vol.XIII, no.1, 1990 p79). According to Lepel H. Griffin, in his famous book Chiefs and Families of note in the Punjab (Lahore, 1910, ii, p254) he writes that Raja Jodh and Raja Wir/Bhir (oldest sons of Rai Mal), """"divided the country, the Maloki Dhan, between them. Jodh took the Salt Range near about the Makrach and captured the town of Makshala from a colony of Brahmans...He changed its name to Makhiala and built there a fort and two tanks for rain water. Wir (also spelt Bhir), the eldest son of Raja Mal, took the possession of Kura (also spelt Khewra) near modern Pind Dadan Khan...""""

As I explained in an edit summary this sentence attempts to summarise the information in mephedrone#UK. 'People have died after taking mephedrone' is intended to summarise """"mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases"""". Likewise 'some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors' is summarising """"The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone"""". Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant. I agree that it is a bit weasely, but how else to you suggest that that section is summarised? WP:LEADCITE is very vague about whether citations are required and when I wrote the lead I erred on making it easier to read rather than ensuring that every fact was supported by a citation there (Wikipedia:Citation_overkill). I could easily copy the references from the main article to the lead for this sentence, but then someone will likely come along and complain that other sentences don't have citations... IMO this is a waste of time when readers could just find the relevant citations in the main body of the article.   """,0
"Where is the data for your claims on accidents?  It's hard to imagine that head-on crashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competitions involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcomes on simple trips to town from the herders' camp to town for grub would most likely have involved bandits and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time.  Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Drivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Drivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protections, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what.  Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses spook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel's website.) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  A car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.

As for feces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. On the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compost.  Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compacted mass. Leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizer. Dump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long-term contamination.",0
Speculation by members of an internet newsgroup such as rec.heraldry cannot in any way be considered as reliable information.,0
"""
I agree. The entire section titled """"Bridging the Second and Third Reichs in German South West Africa"""" looks like WP:OR. Although I'm sure some authors have touched on the subject, our article gives it undue space. In addition, lots of items in the table look like pure speculation. Descriptions such as """"Heinrich """"worked"""" in German Southwest Africa, and Hermann was a """"well known member"""" of the NSDAP""""; this guy """"originated the slogan Lebensraum while in GSWA in 1910, a sympathizer who influenced the NSDAP since 1923""""; or even """"member NSDAP in 1933, founder of German East Africa"""" (this article is not about German East Africa). Enumerating every single person who visited GSWA and later had some role in WWII does not seem especially remarkable or particularly informative and the entire section could be reduced to a paragraph or two summarizing the arguments for the link that some authors have provided. Remember, this article is about German South-West Africa - i.e. narrower in scope than German colonialism and wider than the Herero and Namaqua Genocide.  (''talk) """,0

 Picasson and military service 

Dear Modernist - 

""""Picasso remained neutral during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II, refusing to fight for any side or country. As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either World War. In the Spanish Civil War, service for Spaniards living abroad was optional and would have involved a voluntary return to the country to join either side. While Picasso expressed anger and condemnation of Francisco Franco and fascists through his art, he did not take up arms against them. He also remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it.""""

The article was deleted via a 3-2 vote.  This isn't a consensus but rather a small majority. I have seen quite often when a 3-2 vote did not result in deletion but the talk of no consensus reached.   Additionally, many individuals in the articles for deletion noted Jorge via MMAnote rather than MAnote .   At worst, I would like to have this article userfied.  Thank you.    
Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! 
Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   
I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! 
Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the """"Significant coverage"""" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that. I mention WP:BASIC specifically because this is (was) a biography and BASIC pertain to biographies specifically. Most critically is the section: """"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   
I have reviewed the sources. Have you read the guideline on reliable sourcing The only reliable source in the deleted article was the book reference and that was roughly 100 words. That and fan sites does not a wikipedia biography make. Also see Other stuff exists.  Humbug! 
You can userfy it over here.  I will update it and improve it. Buddy23Lee you can perform fixes to it as well.  Make it a complete article. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:CrazyAces489/jorgegracie

 Edit war brewing at Yosemite National Park 

If you have some spare energy, please come and lend a hand. Thanks! —  

Looked ... acted ... )   

I was also approached recently with regards to possible edits to the Yosemite National Park article. My input on the matter can be found at the following link;
user talk:Edit Centric#Hantavirus Risk in Yosemite

Noted,   

 Thmc1 / 173.63.176.93 sill sockpuppeting / REPLYU REQUSTED 

This person (blocked sockmaster Thmc1) is still block evading by not logging in, even after he was warned by SysAdmin Kudpung. I would suggest that you block the suspected IPs(173.63176.93, 74.88.160.244) as well as IPs used by his other blocked account (Nyc88) and any other accounts affiliated w/them. Why are sockppuppets of a blocked sockmaster still allowed to edit even after ample warnings? To make matters worse, he even violated his block and continuted editing the day after he was blocked! Please see Thmc1 sockpuppet investigation archive for latest investigation/evidence.   

No clue  links would be helpful.   

Actually I think it's the other way around, if I'm not mistaken, I think I remember   being mentioned to admin Ronhjones as a possible sockpuppet in the past few months in conjunction with an edit disagreement issue. Are you stocking this address? Is this some sort of retaliation? First of all, I have no idea who any of these other users are, much less others who use this IP address. 173.63.176.93  
Hmm... Thanks, I think, hadn't noticed the 173... above was the same as the 173... I just talked to .. still no clue why MBaxter showed up here. Aw well - keep on keepin' on   

Vsmith- Don't let 173.63.176.93 fool you. It was him who attempted to mention this to RonHJones using IP 74.88.160.244. That IP was found to be one of 173.63.176.93's sockpuppet and blocked after a recent investigation. 173.63.176.93 is actually a sockpuppet of Thmc1, blocked for excessive sockpuppeting back in 2010. Even though 173.63.176.93 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1's sockpuppet, he was let off with a warning. For the full story, I suggest that you check out Thmc1's most recent investigation, August 2012. The final assessment was one account (Nyc88) permanently blocked, one IP temporarily blocked, and one left open with warning. If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation. The reverting of your edits is the same kind of BS he conducted on the London City article that got him blocked back in 2010. He has an anti-UK bias amongst many, and you can confirm this with user Eraserhead1.   —Preceding undated comment added  

Hantavirus
VSmith, I actually came to your talk page for a different reason and just happened to notice this. It looks ridiculous and I think this MBaxter1 character is highly suspicious himself. In the meantime, can you please look at this story seen on the main CNN.com page today? http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/05/health/hantavirus-warnings/index.html?hpt=hp_t1
I think that this Yosemite hantavirus story is worthy of at least brief mention in the article because it is now having international implications. I just don't see a justification in ignoring it completely, thanks.173.63.176.93

"Could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article?  There are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science, as you know.  TS 

@Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are

 Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.  
 Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly)
 Theoretical model: Feedback

As to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article. 

The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article. 

The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.

The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.",0

Wikipedia welcomes pictures even if they are not from the 'serious' sources. Pictures are the exclusion from the rule that one cannot add a personal content to Wikipedia.

If the content in Polish on the website www.garycki.com/index.html contradicts the above statement the website can be split between two independent domains (although still mutually linked, why not?) - one of which will be dedicated to the national parks.
I would at least leave the link on the """"List of national parks of Norway"""" pages because you cannot find a better photo guide to ALL national parks in this country, including the planned ones, even on the government www.dirnat.no pages.

Sorry, Dennis, but this doesn't convince me. You're saying that a Wikipedia visitor can """"check facts"""" for themselves by checking the sources, but this simply presupposes that the source is correct. It sounds like you're telling me that if I write an article referencing the Sump website, then that's just my opinion and it's unverifiable. But if someone else writes an article referencing the Sump website, then that IS verifiable, and that makes it okay. Well that sounds daft to me. It makes more sense to examine the preponderance of evidence and listen to counter arguments, albeit in the form of links). I simply don't accept the assertion that just because something is published, it's reliable, and if it's not reliable, it's a """"soft fact"""". It's just opinion. Yes, published articles are verifiable, but so what? An alternative system would be one where the Wikipedia author looks at other (offered) articles, examines them for credibility and rationality (even if the article contradicts the existing orthodoxy), and then decides whether to include a given link. But the boot-strapping system as employed by Wikipedia is illogical and is not likely to produce accurate or reliable articles. It's just as likely, if not more likely, to propogate misinformation. I won't be editing the Ariel page. Ultimately, faith underpins everything, not least the credibility of verifiable sources. If the Ariel page is wrong now, which it is, then it's will stay wrong for some time - and if that doesn't illustrate the fundamental weakness of the """"verifiability"""" dogma, then I don't know what does.""",0

The Lord's Sermon on the Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure,22 where faith, hope, and charity are formed and with them the other virtues. The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity.""""

""""Let charity be genuine. . . . Love one another with brotherly affection. . . . Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality.""""29 This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of conscience in the light of our relationship to Christ and to the Church.""""

""""1973: Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical counsels. The traditional distinction between God's commandments and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to charity, the perfection of Christian life. The precepts are intended to remove whatever is incompatible with charity. The aim of the counsels is to remove whatever might hinder the development of charity, even if it is not contrary to it.""""

Fusion-Mutiny

The Fusion and Mutiny played more games than are listed on this page.  Their rivalry lasted from 1998-2001.   

 Rowdies vs Miami Toros? 

Any thought to expanding this rivalry to include its pre-history, the 1975 and 1976 NASL Seasons when the Rowdies played against the Miami Toros, who would become the the Strikers? If we are including MLS matches, this notion would also seem logical to me. Cheers to all! -  

Original research
I know there's been a lot of earnest work here, but the premise appears to be entirely original research. It combines information and scores for every team from the two metropolitan areas, whether there was any real connection or not. The original Tampa Bay Rowdies were not related to the Tampa Bay Mutiny or the modern Tampa Bay Rowdies/FC Tampa Bay. The original Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami Toros were not related to the second Fort Lauderdale Strikers, the Miami Fusion, or the third Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami FC. And of course several of those were named for or played in Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. I doubt that any source outside of Wikipedia has ever pulled them all together like this. Most of the sources used here are either self-published blogs, or they just give information on individual teams or games; they don't make a claim about an overall rivalry lasting since the 1970s. Unfortunately, this article may need a total reshifting in focus to keep it. t/c 

Allow me to address your areas of concern about this page:

THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? 

BLOGS AS A SOURCE: A quick count of the sourcing shows 37 of the 91 cited sources are from blogs, etc. Even by the broadest of definitions (i.e. 50% + 1), this is not """"most of the sources"""" as you state. It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets. Closer examination will further show that even some of the blog sourced material happens to be previously published np photos and/or articles that were scanned and posted in the blogs.

MLS era: In the MLS years, the Mutiny had several former Rowdies working in their front office staff, one of whom, by the way now happen to work for the current Rowdies. Both they and the Fusion had former NASL-era Rowdies and Strikers as their head coaches at one time or another. The Miami Ultras were originally the Fusion's supporters. They now follow the Strikers. The connections were always there. As a matter of fact, inclusion of the Mutiny/Fusion era",0

Well, opposing viewpoints frequently meet in wikis.  """"Neutral"""" POV and """"common sense"""" are highly subjective and the only solutions are to either favour one viewpoint as a matter of site policy or to let people battle it out.  If you choose the former approach, admins need to monitor contributions very carefully.  If the number of contributors is large, you have to police the site through very """"blunt"""" use of editing restrictions (massive IP range blocks, night editing restrictions etc) which slows the development of the wiki considerably.  If you choose the latter, editors are allowed to run free and the project grows quickly.  However, you can end up with long, protracted debates between editors about seemingly trivial points.

Wikipedia was founded on the principle of allowing very open editing with minimal intervention by admins, and I doubt that will ever change.  You can console yourself with the fact that all of the millions of articles here can be copied freely (under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license) to other wiki projects and edited to suit the viewpoint of the site!

Why do you remove so many bands so persistantly?

It really is quite pathetic how obsessesive you seem to be over this.

And by the way, Evans Blue are quite simple NOT Hard Rock, and its not heavy metal or alternative metal either, it's Post-Grunge, just like so many other bands classed as Alternative Metal.

And the bands myspace seems like solid evidence to me, yes the band can call themselves what they like, its their band, and surely they understand it more than anyone else, so shouldn't you go by what they say?

"""Jackson didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on """"We've Had Enough"""" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support all his siblings and parents. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, """"Dangerous"""", and it was thoroughly mediocre music. Almost all of Jackson's remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - a meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album weren't good, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, but the less said about that the better. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire the disgraced former King of Pop. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's active career finished a decade ago. ( )

M, This colon convention gets out of hand after maybe two. 
I've just looked over the articles you suggested I might take an eye to. We will have something to discuss, I see. You don't take on small issues! Much more daring than I am. 
I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather. 

I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use. 
Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda. 

This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.

Enough. Have to go anyway. Tell me whether anything I've said is of any use.  23:41",0

Dear Arkaever, what you write makes absolutely no sense - and your spelling of """"hypothesis"""" with """"hi"""" at the beginning is the first hint that it is so.

Everyone who has ever visited places both in the continental climate and near the ocean must know that places near the oceans have much more stable temperatures (while the continental climate has much more brutal variations) because the relevant layer of water has much higher heat capacity than the relevant layer of soil. The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly; on the other hand, it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil.

That's also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable - and much more important for the global variability of the climate - than effects that occur on the sea. They may appear or disappear mostly on the Northern Hemisphere. At any rate, the Milankovitch theory works, as settled in Roe's paper.

"Dr.I.K.Gill. He has devoted his life for the needy be Dr,Sheikh M.Akram 

               Dr.I.K.Gill
       He has devoted his life for the needy
Not long ago Dr.I.K.Gill an expert in psychology and physical education came over to Pakistan from Germany. He held workshops in special education and physical education. Under the leadership of Dr.Gill workshops were held in Karachi as well as in Lahore. In Karachi workshops, teachers from special education institutes attended under his able leadership. Teachers from Punjab and North Frontier Province attended the similar courses in Lahore.
Dr.I.K.Gill taught mental health and physical education for handicapped children. During these workshops he instructed the teachers how to teach children in physical movements so that they are able to lead their lives as normal human beings and they do not remain dependant on others.
Dr.I.K.Gill originally comes from Pakistan. He was born 1924 in a village in Sialkot District. He was born in a poor home therefore he had to labour hard in the fields. However, he was keenly interested in acquiring education. He did his primary schooling in his own village and did his high school graduation at C.T.I. High School, Sialkot. After high school he joined the army and served his country in British India Government.  After release from the army he worked in Government College of Physical Education, Walton. Lahore as a superintendent and teacher.
In 1956 he got a chance to go for higher studies in Germany in a college of physical education along with the university of  Cologne, Germany. After graduation from Germany, he went to the University of Graz, Austria for Ph.D. Having completed his PhD he went back to Germany and worked as a teacher of physical education. During his service he happened to see a photo in a church magazine, which alerted his life profoundly for ever. They were the images of people suffering from leprosy. The moment he saw a fellow countryman, he was shaken through and through. At that moment he decided to go to Pakistan. Within a short time by the Grace of God through the German Leprosy Relief Association he landed in Pakistan with his newly wedded wife.
He started his work in Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi (e.g.the Leprosy Colony in a hut behind McLeod Road, later a building was bought in Frere Road in Saddar Bazaar)
From 1962 to 1970 Dr, Gill worked for the welfare of Leprosy patients in Pakistan. 
Dr. Gill said about his mission “I always wanted to know those unfortunate people who are dependant in one way or the other upon others. My ambition was to teach such people to be able to do their own work and lead an independent happy life. Such unfortunate people are victim of unhappiness and misery, therefore my yearning was to help and work for the welfare of such weaker sections of community. So I thought I must involve myself in a difficult mission. For such vital mission I chose to come to my own beloved country Pakistan”. Dr. Gill concentrated his special attention  on backward and handicapped children in Pakistan because  in his opinion today’s child is a responsible citizen, a child is tomorrow`s father being the builder and protector of the next generation. Therefore to educate him or her today is very important. Dr. Gill said that besides food and refuge is necessary for these children but undoubted education most important.  Dr. Gill revealed that he is very surprised to discover that parents of these unfortunate children have no ambition to educate these disadvantaged children. Today children are expected to contribute in the family income and expenditure. Let’s say that handicapped children cannot do so, but if they educated to look after their needs themselves and their person, they do not remain dependant upon others for the whole of their lives. Special education can make life easier and productive.
TABIn view of his services from 1962 -70 Government of Pakistan invited Dr.I.K.Gill to Pakistan. He came back to train teachers of physical and special education, so that these teachers could provide special education to needy children in their respective areas. 
Dr. Gill provided this facility in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. He stayed and carried on his services for about eight weeks to complete series of lectures.
He also came back this year again to carry on series of special education training which took place in Lahore and Karachi. He appreciated greatly that three universities accepted the challenge and established the departments of special education. Dr. Gill trained forty teachers both in Lahore and Karachi who would further train teachers in special education. Therefore the number of teachers will be increased. 
Dr. Gill used modern techniques i.e. videos used in Germany, movies, wheelchairs, small sandbags, balloons and many more others. It was shown how",0

These are prior comments from earlier this year (2011) that were ignored:

1. Wikipedia Elective surgery states: """"Elective surgery is surgery that is scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately.""""

2. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective surgery as follows: """"Surgery that is subject to choice (election)...As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery."""" []

3. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective as follows: """"In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time."""" []

4. Wikipedia Surgery states: """"Types of surgery: Surgical procedures are the commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation. Based on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. Based on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.""""

Thus a reasonable person would conclude that non-emergency therapeutic surgery is a subcategory of elective surgery. Nearly all surgical abortions are NOT emergency procedures (in other words, they are scheduled procedures and are not medical emergencies).      

It seems that this Abortion article's inartful use of the terms """"elective"""" and """"therapeutic"""" confuses the reader rather than clarifying important distinctions. One would use """"elective"""" to describe a procedure based on the timing of the surgery. One would use the term """"therapeutic"""" to describe a procedure based on whether there has been a diagnosis.  The 2 terms are not mutually exclusive.  

If the terms """"elective"""" and """"therapeutic"""" are to be applied consistently (with no politically correct definitions for procedures performed on pregnant women), then virtually all therapeutic abortions are also elective procedures. Practically speaking, in nearly all modern situataions the 2 terms will be mutually inclusive because modern medicine considers the satisfaction of any woman's desire to no longer be pregnant (regardless of the reason why she no longer wants to be pregnant) as """"therapeutic"""", and abortion is virtually NEVER performed under emergency conditions (in other words: there are virtually no occurences in which an abortion must be done immediately to avoid a serious health risk).   

The current section of this article called """"Induced"""" [] contains a false dichotomy when it states: """"Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to: ... An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman """"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease."""". 

This false dichotomy should be corrected by helping the reader understand that the 2 terms therapeutic and elective are virtually synonymous, rather than leading the reader to incorrectly think that an abortion is EITHER elective OR therapeutic. Rarely will any therapeutic abortion not also be elective.  

Finally, using the term """"therapeutic"""" also implies that the condition of being pregnant is a disease or a health defect, when in reality, absent any political use of medical terminology, pregnancy is a sign of a healthy reproductive system and is never a disease. There are extremely rare occassions when organs of or near the reproductive tract are diseased and an abortion could thus be therepeutic to the gravid woman (though fatal to the fetus). 

Perhaps this wording would address these concerns:

Wow!  I just saw tonight's news article on Wikipedia that played on FOX News.  (Earlier, I'd posted here the AP article on Wikipedia from Dec 12, 2005.)

In what has become a huge coincidence, the very day the media begins reporting on the dangers of Wikipedia, happens to be the day immediately after the very week I discovered misinformation and falsehoods being posted on this page about nitrites, and then tried to edit them by attempting to add more accurate information, but then was attacked and harassed by another person who disagrees with my edits  and was ultimately blocked and threatened by a purported Wikipedia administrator.

As was reported in the news today, people can go to http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/ to learn more about how Wikipedia functions, and where the dangers exist.

The folks at wikipediawatch report that, what's happening in Wikipedia, is that any collection of citations that may APPEAR balanced is all that anybody expects. If the title or snippet in a link itself contributes to this impression, then the full text is not researched by anyone.

This is exactly what has been going on in this nitrite page.  As a result, it truly is, as wikipediawatch reminds us, """"garbage in, garbage out, garbage back in...""""  and after a few cycles of this, it all turns into """" a big, stinking heap"""".

Truly, as the news media warned today: """"Don't believe eveyrthing you read on the Web, especially on Wikipedia!""""

The following two posts, found in a wikipediareview blog, sum up my experiences this past week, after having been harassed, threatened and finally blocked, after I attempted to add to the body of knowledge about nitrites/poppers.  They demonstrate how dangerous Wikipedia  based on its current model  really is:

""""Wikipedia's procedural faults, complete anarchy as regards contributions, and sometimes-bizzare social rules do not teach people to become good researchers or writers... it teaches them how to be good Wikipedians, or to get the hell out."""" - Jason Scott
"""". . . when it comes to history and politics, Wikipedia can claim whatever it wants by shutting out those who actually know something about a certain topic. In that way, Wikipedia can rewrite history as it sees fit - which may have nothing to do with reality or the actual facts."""" - SummerFR

Finally, this post on a board, discussing wikipedia, really sets it out well:

""""Any moron can pretty well say anything they want on any topic, which is fine for a News Group or a Forum but not an Encyclopedia.

In my opinion a reference source should be authoritative enough to end arguments not start them.

I believe that Wikipedia could better serve the internet community if they checked their facts first before publishing the article.

Instead, we have a situation where the cart is placed before the horse and we end up with what is left by the horse.""""

Unfortunately, my machine got stolen last night which is likely going to seriously damage my own ability to combine those banners. I don't think this machine even has the tildes to do a signature, so I'm going to have to tell you by hand that this is John Carter. What you might consider doing is asking the Rome project to become a subproject of Italy, or, if it is inactive, just merge the banners yourself.

As much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected, spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the Rohingya, and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party - are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live. There is already a lot of articles on the Arakanese people and state that have no concern of the Rohingya but include them for the sake of brotherly respect - this is pushing the line a bit far. Rohingyas should be treated fairly - I do not contest that. But articles like this one - are pure self-pitying and clutters Wikipedia with absolutely useless information. I wonder when will somebody change the name of the article on Burma/Myanmar on wiki to """"Country where the Rohingya are Persecuted"""".

"The fact that Jenny is raped while unconscious during the course of the film shows that Jenny may not be aware of all of the sexual encounters she's had.

I always thought that was the whole point of the rape scene — to show that naive beliefs held by these kids can't be trusted.  Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner, or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.

No one is going to win that type of argument. Also, I suggest you stop calling cowboy """"Jake"""" from now on, as it also implies that he is someone he claims not to be. Clearly he is determined to push his case, and the only way to make it go away is that you ignore him altogether. Socks are a complex issue as they come in different forms. But if you give them enough rope, they'll eventually hang themselves with it. Challenging suspected socks non-stop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation. SPI does not support the claim at present, and baiting cowboy will not look good on your behalf, whatever the outcome. I'm sure, by """"rotating IP"""" he probably means proxies.

Hitler was quite right when he said that Admiral Graf Spee should have won the battle. She lost because of errors made by captain Langsdorff. Graf Spee outgunned all her opponents, having 11 inch main guns, to Exeters 8 inch and Ajax and Achilles 6 inch guns.

Langsdorff should have concentrated the fire on Exeter first before Admiral Graf Spee came into the range of the light cruisers.

Instead, Langsdorff split his fire between the three targets, with the result that although Exeter was severely damaged and forced to withdraw, the other ships got into range and scored 20 hits on Admiral Graf Spee, including on the food stores and bakeries.""",0

His knowledge of wikipedia's rules seems to be extensive, but then why have they only edited pages relating to CAD? The nature of his edits, as it has been said, smacks of self interest. I really don't see the need for proving that he is who he is, but it is pretty obvious. For example, posting that he is Buckley on his user talk page will get you banned from the cad forums and Buckley's blog. I'll save you some time Tim, you've already banned this IP.  And this isn't hard to believe since he claims to make a living off income from his comic. For example, in this talk page he suggested that the fact that there are CAD gamer pictures available on xbox live. Those cost money, which means someone is making money. This is not article worthy and the thought of using wikipedia for free advertising would just be low. Ask people a million times to buy them on the cad site, but not here.

I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of Töbel, here it comes:

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name.

So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own?

Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. 
That was for learning",0

"I agree with you 
Wikipedia does need to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web 2.0 encyclopedia. Here was something I said in the talk page of the 'a more perfect union'.

(I believe that most of time the argument is about this main issue of 'Is Wikipedia is being used for publicity?' and NOT an argument about whether it is just an 'Encyclopedia of important events or topics occuring or occured'. I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons. Most of the times people are forgotten but what they have done or said makes them remembered. Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech. I say let the people decide how they filter their information, because the election only objectively affects 300 million Americans [9], but the race-issue affects everybody on the planet, and this speech IS a key speech on that matter.Msethisuwan (talk) )",0

"""It does not matter if they disclaim it's truthfulness. What matters is if they adhere to its teachings. There are some within the Church, sadly, who do not believe the Book of Mormon to be true - rather they believe it is inspired, non-historical scripture, or that it contains good teachings. Some of these would say the Book of Mormon is the word of God, others may not. However, they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to Mormonism. 

I agree that CoC are moving farther and farther away from """"Mormonism,"""" but until they completely turn away from the history, culture and teachings they are still a part of Mormonism. Please note I didn't say they were Mormons, but rather adherents to Mormonism. The term Mormon in its connotation is narrow enough now to refer to members of the LDS Church and its 20th century offshoots, not most of the pre-1900 offshoots. It is NPOV to say they adhere to Mormonism. But not to say they are Mormons. I am willing to stand by that unless convinced otherwise - feel free to ask your friend. - 20:24, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Status and Advice 
I deleted it, both as copyvio and because it would be considered promotional in any case.  

A Wikipedia article  needs to be written like an encyclopedia article, not a press releasedon't praise the organization or person, say what they do. Don't talk about the overall importance of the subjector use adjectives of praise. . Remember not to  copy from a web site, even your own  first it's a copyright violation, but, even if you own the copyright and are willing to give us permission according to WP:DCM, the tone will not be encyclopedic and the material will not be suitableas this was not.

You will need to rewrite the articles to Wikipedia  style; a good place to start learning it  is    our guide to writing Wikipedia articles .  

First, give the basic informationthe source should be the CV birthplace and date, degrees, previous positions. If there are published books, list them in formal bibliographic style.  List the 3 or 4 most influential articles similarly, getting citation figures from Scopus or Web of Science or Google Scholar, or some other appropriate source. Do not include conference presentations, book chapters, and other minor published work. Such a list needs to be frequently updated, and belongs in the CV, not an encyclopedia.  

Include major national level offices and awards, but not minor ones and certainly not student awards. Be sure to list editorships (but not mere editorial board membership) we consider it very important, and you should add it to the articles for the relevant journals also, with a link to the bio. AQ award is worth mentioning; a nomination for an award is not. 
 
It is not necessary to cite the basic information in detail to other than the official CV. However, give  references providing substantial coverage from  3rd party independent published reliable sources, print or online, but not blogs or press releases, or material derived from press releases. For any part you quote directly from a published bio, include quotation marks and a reference. Do just just say """" It has been widely covered by press outlets such as The New York Times and Forbes."""" Give the reference in full, including the title of the article and a link to it.  

Pay particular attention to the way we make links to other Wikipedia  articles.  Avoid WP:Peacock terms: do not use words of praise, ofr state that the person is important: the contents of the article will show it. 

Don't just give a general list of all the fields he is interested in. Say briefly what his research has shown, with citations. 

Include only material that would be of interest to a general reader coming across the mention of the subject and wanting the sort of information that would be found in an encyclopedia. Do not include material that would be of interest only to those associated with the subject, or to prospective studentsthat sort of content is considered promotional. Keep in mind that the goal of an encyclopedia  is to say things in a concise manner, which is not the style of  press releases or  web sites, or CVs,  which are usually more expansive.

Note: Stubs are allowed on Wikipedia and many articles are stubs. It may be inappropriate to merge or redirect an article about a television episode just because it is a stub. Before executing a merge, ask yourself:
Will the merge reduce the quality or coherence of the target article?

Has anyone created a list of stubs proposed for merge? 
Have these stubs been tagged for Notability or Sources and allowed to grow?
How diligent was/were efforts to expand these stubs before proposing a merge?

Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) """,0

"""::: Monkeykiss, Stephen I agree with you. I will ad the socio-political implications in the main section. In my opinion, the deeds (kamma)and its effect of an individual, being completely irreversible, are stored in the collective memories of others. They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms ( books, heridity, stories, fables etc). For e.g. Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago. Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another. the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma. Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes re-birth again. Kamma may recoil on the doer ( if i kill, i may get killed through revenge) or it may have an impact on others ( if i take a bribe, my children will have to suffer social stigma) or it can have effect on the future generations ( if i harm the environment mindlessly, future generations will not get clean water/air). It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer. Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible. Thus its imperative to """"THINK"""" before acting. There is no gain in regretting/praying later. Your opinion pls? with metta

 Social media 
The Hoax Slayer site has one page that is FB related. Recently, I saw the old email hoax of the two-striped jumper (spider) make the rounds on Zuck's baby. Now, whoever originated this thing did the disinformation. Unsuspecting folks forwarded misinformation. Again, the one who started the FB chain was doing disinformation (albeit more mischief than not, perhaps). But, I saw many reasonable folks take it at face value. There may be several reasons for this: trust of the sender, spider phobia, not taking the time to check out the message before forwarding (Share or Comment in the FB milieu). It was nice to find the Wikipedia page's section on the Hoax. Ought we have a category for hoaxes (motivated by continuing examples which necessitate discussion of this topic)? My little example is probably one of many that were active today where some of these might have been downright malevolent. BTW, this is the status of the page when I last edited (2007). Has the content really progressed from that earlier context? All this verbiage, for six years. It's simple.

Films

Hi Nehrams hope your studies are going well and are off on vacation. First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template -including genre, art direction, casting, second unit director, costume design for example. Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilms/Westerns to conentrate on improving western film articles -I know a number of members who would be interested. 

You'll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images  these include  Template:Filmrationale  (for screenshots and posters)  and Template:Filmbiorationale (for all deceased film people). I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO! much easier. It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them. For normal bios use Template:Biorationale

I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles, For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images. Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain? I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1.

I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out. Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960-present is really needed.

"""Finally a Judge that is real. She has not let the mighty """"Camera"""" interfere with her ability to see things in a clear perspective. Judge Marilyn Milian's has proved year after year that American's would much rather see a television judge who shows a practical yet also fair and just side of American Law which seems to be made more and more of a mochary with each passing day.
I watched her for the first time in June of 1999, and knew immediately that I liked her. It is ten years later and I only continue to find myself liking her more and more with each passing day, week, season & year.

I think that Kintetsubuffalo/Chris has a good point when he says that the article """"reads more like a family genealogy"""", but I don't think that the solution is to trim out the less notable people.   On the contrary, they have a place in the story of the family, but the significance of their role intends up being uninentionally overstated by the article's structure.
The genealogy is clearly an important part of the article, but I suggest that it should be at the bottom of the article, in the place where an appendix would be in a book. What the article needs, I suggest, is a clear narrative,  telling of the story of the family's activities. That could be done either thematically (e.g. politics, medicine, industry) or chronologically, or maybe by a combination of both approaches.
Vernon has clearly done a lot of excellent research, and has plenty of useful material with which to tell the story here, and I would really enjoy reading the story once it's written up.  I have been looking for a few articles which might serve as examples of how this might be done, and found a few which might help:
Rothschild banking family of England (the best I found)
Bulmer (family) (a much weaker article but it tells a story)
Mitford family (narrative a bit short, but heading in the right direction)
German sisters (more integrated than the Mitfords)

A&C; Black. pp. 82–83, makes no mention of at all of child pornography, but talks about a conference on child custody problems in which the ICMEC took part, and which, according to the source resulted in """"little to solve the problems"""". The third source is a strategic plan by the Hague Conference on Private International Law which again does not mention child pornography once. 
The last source talks about ICMEC being involved in training law enforcement officers in Thailand about child exploitation issues. This is not """"working with legislatures to adopt new laws"""".

I would be glad to, Noformation. A conflict of interest is defined as """"Where advancing outside interests is more important to an editor than advancing the aims of Wikipedia"""". The aims of Wikipedia is to produce a """"neutral, reliably sourced encyclopedia"""". My position is that editors from the rational-skeptic wikiproject and their ilk are NOT neutral in this subject, and in fact are incapable of being neutral because they do not have any hands on empirical experience with acupuncture, no specialist dedicated learning in it, have not taken the time to grapple with the unique and complex paradigm that contextualizes it, and thus their knowledge of it is incomplete and immature, and they are ill-equiped to provide a full, rounded, mature and neutral synthesis of the information available on this topic.

Now, as for myself, I will tell it straight, I work 12~15 hours per week in acupuncture practice, earning $35 per hour. Acupuncture practice is not my main source of income, in fact my only purpose for practicing acupuncture is to deepen my understanding of the art and sharpen my skills in it. It requires 10,000 hours of purposeful practice to become a master of any discipline, and one day I aim to achieve mastery in this discipline.

I refute the suggestion that those people who are most qualified, have the most experience, have done the most study, and are most knowledgeable and passionate about this subject should be excluded from editing on the grounds of COI. In fact these are the ones whose input is most valuable, far more valuable than the input of ivory-tower rational skeptics who only bother to attempt to understand acupuncture through a theoretical, critical and dismissive point of view. In fact, considering the tone of most editors on the acupuncture talk page, which emulates the tone of those """"Quackwatch"""" websites that proliferate on the web these days, and considering their devoted following of Edzard Ernst and their elevation of his work as the number 1 source on the page (literally), and their transparent agenda of """"de-bunking"""" the """"pseudo-science"""" they consider acupuncture to be, it rather seems to an objective observer that is those editors who are """" advancing outside interests"""" rather than being neutral, and thus they in breach of COI, as opposed to I.

 Proposed wording on the """"generalities"""" of autoformatting 

Since the key members of the pro-autoformatting side—UC Bill and Locke Cole—have conceded that the results of the previous RfC on “son of autoformatting” would likely repeat itself if we conducted an ArbCom-sponsored RfC (∆ here), where Locke wrote , I am tempted to ask that you, Ryan, issue a declaratory judgement due to their default. I can’t help but suspect that they knew all along that the previous RfC was a fair measure of the true community consensus when Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom. However…

I instead propose that we do as Locke proposes: present autformatting to the community in a more generalized manner, not attached to any specific implementation such as UC Bill’s “son of autoformatting” as described above.

That is an interesting spin on your earlier comment: my views have """"zero validity"""" on my talk page, but """"100% validity"""" at an RFC. I am not sure I can make a cogent response to these conflicting statements.
In answer to your question, I think it important to maintain clear personal boundaries when it comes to disputes between editors. Not accepting personal attacks is one such boundry, another is courtesy, and another is mutual respect. If these personal boundries break down, subsequent discussion can degenerate into generalised mudslinging, which I think is what happened with the RFC's I have been the subject of. These RFC's have brought accusations that are too generalised to either prove or refute. As a generalisation, it is generally a good idea to avoid accusations based on generalisations, because I would end up being painted in a bad light whether I particiated or not.  
With regard to the RFC, the lack of courtesy shown by not being notified of a draft being started is indicative of a lack of respect for myself, or at least that is my personal view (valid or not). Evidence support this view is indicated by the fact that if the proposers of the RFC were really interested in resolving their personal disagreements with me, they would have brought their pet peeves to this talk page first, and we could resolve them in an amicable way. Unfortunetly, that did not happen. I can only speculate why, but I think it has something to do with the inabilty of a group of editors (myself included) not being able to come to shared understanding of how notability applies to certain topics.
I am a reasonable editor, and I am confident when it comes to disputes (personal or editorial), a that shared understanding of the issues involved can be reached. But it can only come about in an atmosphere of mutual respect and courtesy. (talk|contribs) """,0

Speedy deletion of Mass (Masud)

Hello NickCT  Could you please describe where synthesis is occurring  that is, can you show where the article is """"combining material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources""""? Could you please describe what you think is a violation of WP:POV? WP:COATRACK is an essay, not a policy, so COATRACK issues are a matter of personal opinion, not of policy.
A few points regarding deletion:
 There are several books, journal articles, chapters of bioethics textbooks, etc. that have been written specifically on the topic of this article (unethical, nonconsensual, and/or illegal medical experiments in the U.S.). They clearly separate this topic from that of human subject research in the United States in general.
 There exist articles for several other nations that are similar to this one, such as Nazi human experimentation, North Korean human experimentation, Japanese human experimentation. They exist for the same reason that this one should exist  numerous high-quality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves.
 A wide array of reliable sources have identified this article's topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis, separate from the broader history of human subject research in general. Per WP:NOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider """"bad"""" (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of """"bad science"""") does not mean that it is """"biased"""" to have an article on them. WP:NPOV does not say that articles can't be about """"bad things"""". It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it. I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying. 
That said, like all articles, this article is an incomplete work in progress, so there are certainly issues. Rather than merely citing policy without reference to this article, please make specific suggestions for how to improve this article.  """,0

 Please help regarding diacritics in Indian mythological names 

Can you please help me regarding the use of diacritics in Indian mythological names used in articles? I am trying to find a policy page (if it exists) on the usage of names that have diacritics in other articles. Some articles include the diacritic information when   non-English words are used while others don't mention them. This sometimes leads to incorrect pronunciation. For eg: in this article Vishvamitra, """"Puthrakameshti"""" is mentioned in the section """"Kaushika"""". In """"Puthrakameshti"""" the first """"a"""" is short while the second """"a"""" is long thereby requiring a diacritic. As you can see, the diacritic is not used in any part of this article. But in this article Valmiki it is used, """"kāṇḍas"""". Do you know if a policy page exists on this? 

What is a nice balance between making it simple and following proper pronunciation? If I include diacritics on every previously unspecified non-English (in this case, mainly Sanskrit) word it would become difficult to read the article. The other extreme is also not very desirable.

Thanks a lot. """,0

 Feral Dogs 
Something about what is said about feral dogs in the article doesn't match with observations on feral dogs. Actually it doesn't even match with some articles in wikipedia. E.G. the Dingo is a feral dog too and they are excellent hunters, as well as the Carolina Dogs, who even seem to have some unique hunting skills. It's also wrong to assume that feral dog packs lack the social structure of wolf packs, you should browse for """"Tuscany Dog Project"""" (thats a study concerning this topic) and the dogs there, although not completely feral, have a very complex social structure in their pack (check the german version of wikipedia if you like, there's a full article). Also wolves don't form packs on general, in Italy and in Germany as well many packs only consist of the parents, their current litter, and the litter of the last year. In Italy, there are many solitary wolves and many who only live in pairs, as well as quite a few packs of feral and semi-feral dogs who can hunt prey wolves aren't capable of and who are competing or interacting with wolves (depends on the situation). So all in all feral dogs aren't that poor.168.224.32.15  

The dingo has had thousands of years to revert back to a semi-ativistic state. Domestic dogs havent had that amount of time to become fully fledged wild animals.

While domestic dogs do form packs, there is little monogamy, cooperative hunting, or mutual puppy care.129.12.200.49  

In all cases? If known cases of adoption, care for puppies by aunts (I admit, there is no prove for care by males), monogamy and cooperative hunting. As a matter of fact, these things aren't as common among wolves as most people think. Don't you think, you generalize to much?
E.G. Erik Zimen (a famous cynologist in Europe) witnessed no monogamy in his poodle group. Observations by Eberhard Trummler and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas came to different results (the first observed dingo/wolf/dog-mixes and the latter Sibirian Huskies), as well as Guenther Bloch in his studies in Italy (two groups and one pack of near-feral dogs, mostly or entirely mongrels). You should keep in mind, that there isn't much data concerning this topic and it wouldn't be the first time that an observer didn't really observe and just judged by what he/she already thought to be true. Remember, for a long time people thought, that wolves would generally form packs with an alpha on the top and an omega on the bottom of the pack or that dogs would always search the nearness of humans, because """"they are born that way"""". Both """"Facts"""" have been proven to be wrong since at least the 80's, although they are still in the mind of many people.

Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information. As for the information being out of date, there is usually a short lag between Sunday-Monday as the data is released and then update in the chart.

"Hi Hanna Simpson. Thank you for the message. I tried to clean up the references you added. Just for reference, there's nothing wrong with citing non-English sources as long as they satisfy WP:RS, but if you do then it's sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per WP:RSUE. This can be added to the citation template using the  parameter (See Template:Cite web#Quote). Translations do not have to be professional quality; They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article. 
Regarding COI, you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at User talk:Materialscientist#Ottoneum. That doesn't mean you can never edit the article, but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make. COI editing is not expressly prohibited, but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WP:PSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are. Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited. Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it; Rather, articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something. So, any sources you can find which discuss the museum and are independent of it would be helpful.",0

pakistan is one of the rich most land on earth.poeple here have all the resources to grow food but they are limited by few factors,

3)..lack of institutional support
4)..traditions and customs

muzaffargarh canal,,which runs through the centre region of muzaffargarh district is no doubt the hub of our agricultural system but it poses following problems also
1)the canal basin and margins are made of mud and not bricks or stones,,,resultantly a huge quantity seeps through and creats large pounds of stagnant water ,,regions called ,,same,,in local language..this huge amount of water is precious and would benifit the region if used for irrigation in tales of branches of the canal
2)..these areas are equally fertile if this issue is sttled and production of food will be doubled by eliminating this issue
3)..50 %of the cultivated land yeils much less than its capacity,,because of higher water table in the near by areas again due to seepage of water through canal
4)the land which is free from the above cited issue yeilds lesser due to non availabilty of water in the irrigation system timely..

"No Anome, what matters is the correct matching up of the maths to physical reality, and the polar coordinate system is the one that is tailor made to deal with concepts such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force.

The centrifugal force is a radial effect and the Coriolis force is a tangential effect.

But before we can use the expressions in polar coordinates we must construct a physical model of a real situation and then construct a differential equation around it, usually in the scalar variable of radial distance. 

If you were in the slightest genuine about this topic, you would have read the section which I added to the main article yesterday. You would have blocked PeR for vandalism and wikistalking for having erased it on specious grounds.

It hardly needed sourced since it is standard planetary orbital theory which obviously none of you know anything about. In fact I did mention Goldstein's Classical Mechanics.

The picture that I am getting here is that the article has been hi-jacked by a group who have had a basic introduction to circular motion but who would be incapable of handling elliptical or hyperbolic motion and so they will all make sure that no such generalizations appear in the main article.

Your group has indulged in a number of deceitful tactics which I will now list.

(1) Making arguments in polar coordinates but jumping into Cartesian coordinates to conceal the flaws. The main example is circular motion, which is all that you seem to be capable of considering. You accept one moment that there is a radially outward centrifugal force balancing a radially inward centripetal force. But as soon as the centrifugal force becomes inconvenient for you, you claim that it vanishes in the inertial frame, even though the centripetal force remains. That is just a nonsense.

(2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet. This is because you feel more comfortable in a field that nobody can understand. It is good cover for talking nonsense.

(3) Introducing Lagrangian mechanics.

(4) Introducing Hamiltonian mechanics.

(5) Introducing matrix algebra.

(6) Quoting Feynam.

We have seen all these tactics used in a pathetic attempt to deny the fact that centrifugal force only occurs when a particle actually possesses an angular velocity relative to a point.

The section which I put in yesterday contained partically all hat you need to know about centrifugal force. But that was too good for you. You much prefer that big mindless waffle of an introduction that tells us absolutely nothing about centrifugal force.",0

"""Comment by Ynhockey: The sanction is puzzling to me as well, and appears ill-advised for the following reasons:
 Amoruso is a prolific contributor to Israel-related topics, therefore the ban is extremely counter-productive
 Amoruso has apologized and acknowledged the BLP violation
 If you look at the article, in fact the editor who filed the complaint was the one who edit-warred and violated other policies, therefore by banning Amoruso who user the talk page to discuss the issues per policy and was not aware that he was violating BLP, you are in fact encouraging bad conduct from other editors, who now know they can get away with edit-warring, personal attacks, soapboxing, etc... just not BLP violations.
 The other evidence brought up by you in the case (like sock puppetry, etc.) is irrelevant seeing as how the issue was dealt with and Amoruso stopped using sock puppets.

In other words, treating BLP as a sacred cow and banning anyone who remotely touches it, while letting other editors get away with just about anything with only """"strong warnings"""" and the like (speaking of which, you might want to look at the Vexorg case because you gave him a strong warning and on the same day he started violating policies again), is not going to help improve Wikipedia, in my honest opinion.

...

Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. 

While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.

Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states 

""""The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names""""  (i.e. not """"must"""" be) 

It further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...

Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)

I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)
  
I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)

HellinaBucket, leave me alone. I'm not editing the Operation Repo article (or any article) any longer, you have no reason to contact me, or ask anyone else to contact me on your behalf. The way that I met you was by catching you in the act of vandalism, and your initial response was to repeat the vandalism. It's true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning, but don't let that embolden you. The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days, does not mean that you are not a vandal, and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted, such use does not constitute a personal attack. You are a vandal. You committed vandalism, you repeated that vandalism, and it's only been a few days since then; it doesn't wear off that quickly. I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again, but my goal was to stop you, and everyone else, from vandalizing the Operation Repo article, I feel confident that I have succeed, and I feel that the allegations of me over-stepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable. It is an added bonus, that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor, and I, once again, thank-you for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor. HellinaBucket, your account is only a month old, why don't you just throw it away and make a new one? There's nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out (If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter, read WP:SOCK, but the basic idea, is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons. If you just want to change your name, or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again, then that's fine.). Whether or not you get a new account, there is no reason for you to contact me. I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals. I continued to monitor it because the vandalism had been common before I was able to get the article protected. Other than that I have no interest in that subject.VegKilla (talk)  HellinaBucket (talk)

That city was very well known in the Russian Empire as the biggest industrial political and transportation center of Transcaucasia under the name Tiflis, the residence of Vice Royal of Caucasus. You can open any map of Russian Empire and you will never see any single mention of the name Tbilisi in any map published in that period. So nobody is arguing that at the moment the city is called Tbilisi but you also should not have any guts to call the nationalistic past of Tbilisi mistifying.

 POV Tag Vandalism? 

David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.

I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. 

1) The """"garbage"""" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the """"controversial"""" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for """"controversial"""" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in """"Crazy Wisdom"""" section in teaching.

2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)

3)""""Undue weight"""" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially """"controversial"""" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da """"self-assessment."""" 

Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. 

Source disputes:
1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or """"self-published"""" simply making assertion that it is a """"competing religious organization"""" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or """"organization"""").

2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the """"contact"""" page on their website.)

All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   """,0

Thats why he hurried to deleet them.
But you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!!
then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column.
But it isn't at all what happened.
My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users.
They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside.
You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case.
As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for.

It isn't a theory. A theory is a scientifically acceptable body of principles that explain phenomena in a reasonable manner. People can read alternative views in thousands of blogs, pseudoscience pieces (books, movies, internet). They have no place in an encyclopedia that relies on reliable, verifiable sources. Cheers   

Your definition is incorrect. Einsteins theory of relativity wasn't accepted at all when he presented it, but it was still a quite valid theory. History is full of people rejected by people with your attitude...   

To be quite honest, were not as stupid as people back in the 15th century. We can actually prove these things with exploration and tests. They couldn't. The world CANNOT explode as a result of Global Warming. Its alot tougher than all these enviromentalists give it credit for, however we can't. It would take some extreme heat to cause any harm to the planet. Just because CO2 levels are at there highest in 20 odd million years doesn't mean the earths getting hotter. It means that we're making CO2. Before, there was nothing to add more CO2 to the atmosphere. Now theres us, and the increase is small but its still the highest in 20 million years. Unless we find a way to turn the air into a thick layer of greenhouse gases, the earth will never heat up more than 10 or so degrees, no matter how long you wait.

Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)""",0

"On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.

In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.

Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. 

As for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)",0

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

Migdia Chinea

The case involves the return of alleged texts belonging to Judaica in possession of the Russian government which could end up on the black market. The U.S. Courts have ordered Russia to preserve and return the texts, but Moscow eventually withdrew from the case citing sovereign immunity. As a result of the lawsuit, the Russian Federation has cancelled loans to Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery in Washington, the J.

In June 2011, the Justice Department filed a notice it would not support the confiscation of Russian artwork on loan as retaliation. (See: """"AGUDAS CHASIDEI CHABAD OF UNITED STATES v.

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

 Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia 

This is somewhat off topic, but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page. Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit.

Had I know it was against the rules to erase one's own talk page, I never would have talked there, since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts (which have embarrassing errors), jokes and so on, which were never intended to be permanent. Anyway, for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success. One of the Sysops here, Mr. Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules, by calling someone: “childish, boorish, pig headed [and] unreasonable” and earlier “an insufferable ninny.” The poor fellow was so overcome by grief & consternation, he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities. (I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale, but he would die of shock. I have done enough damage already; I fear he may need long-term therapy.)

Anyway, I was banned for this unspeakable language, and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame. I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page. I fear he may revert both, and delete this message, but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JedRothwell I quote Schiller's warning: """"Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens."""" ('Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain.') (Maid of Orleans, act 3, sc. 6). Hence, the title of this message.

Thick-skinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly:

. . . If you would like a reason to block me, or prove that I have violated the rules, you need not preserve the talk page. Here is another deliberate & intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an old-school personal insult:

You are a loathsome, sanctimonious, hypocritical, ignorant twit. If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion, I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them.

I hope that is satisfactory.

That goes for you, too, Mr. . . uh, Chihuahua – isn’t it? Bow wow! Ruff! Grrrrr . . . Consider yourself gravely insulted. If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel, but since I am a craven bounder, I would, of course, run away instead of accepting. Believe me, I am trying to get away, without success so far.  """,0

:This discussion is transcluded from Talk:University College London/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the reassessment.

{{#ifeq:|Talk||}}
 To uphold the quality of Wikipedia:Good articles, all articles listed as Good articles are being reviewed against the GA criteria as part of the GA project quality task force. While all the hard work that has gone into this article is appreciated, unfortunately, as of August 17, 2009, this article fails to satisfy the criteria, as detailed below. For that reason, the article has been delisted from WP:GA. However, if improvements are made bringing the article up to standards, the article may be nominated at WP:GAN. If you feel this decision has been made in error, you may seek remediation at WP:GAR. 

There are at least 5 broken links.

I'm concerned that some sections of this article look like a personal essay. For instance, from Student accommodation: """"Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates. The majority of second and third-year students and postgraduates find their own accommodation in the private sector. This is partly due to the fact that accommodation in and around Central London is often cheaper than university accommodation when shared with friends or flat-mates."""" Thay may well be true, but personal reminiscences are not suitable material for an encyclopedia article. Whose opinion is this? It needs to be either cited or removed.

I'm also concerned that almost the entire Alumni and academics section is uncited, and neither are sources provided in the main article to which this one links.

The present order of sections makes no sense, starting as it does with Academic reputation. Take a look at other university GAs such as University College, Durham or University of Bristol to get some ideas for a more logical presentation sequence.

The Notable buildings section needs to be converted to prose, and to focus on the notable buildings, not just list every building. It ought to be telling us something about these notable buildings, not just listing them.

The Student accommodation section is similarly largely just a list. This article is not supposed to be a brochure for University College.

The relevant pictures from the Gallery ought to be incorporated into the text at the appropriate places and the rest transferred to Commons with a link from this article.

The last three sections—Ethical investment policy, Filming at UCL, and University crest—do not contain enough material to warrant standalone sections.

Ref #85 is marked """"Suspended Domain"""", which makes me suspicious at the current status of UCL Biomedica.

WRT """"innocent""""  this is not a """"verified fact"""".  
 Does the Chinese government agree they are """"innocent""""?  No.
 The DoJ appealed Urbina's ruling on Razakah's habeas.  Did they think he is """"innocent""""?
 Urbina wasn't ruling on Razakah's """"innocence"""".  None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were """"innocent"""" of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the """"preponderance of the evidence"""" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.

The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were """"innocent"""".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, """"enemy combatants"""".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were """"enemy combatants"""".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.

Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's """"innocence"""" has been an established fact.
As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina.
If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, """"...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah..."""", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase """"wrongfully imprisoned"""" in other habeas rulings.

WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.

WRT his """"innocence"""", you assert above: """"There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established """"early"""".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.    """,0

""" and the guys. What does Vegas, hospital visits, Streisand and the firing of Red, Sonny and David have to do with their violent behaviour and games such as War?   

I'd like the bits mentioned above to remain for the reasons stated by ElvisFan1981.   

A separate section on Elvis and violence? I think not. Some stuff could be added to the Memphis Mafia article if it's new. However, it may well be that more detail may be too much, but that can be appraised here and when it crops up in the article - as can comparisons with other authors' interpretations. I'll probably make edits to trim or to make additions more concise, as I have been. If anyone disagrees, I'm sure they'll comment. I'm glad   is taking such an interest in this article - and they have a talk page (my mistake for not noticing).   

A proposed inclusion reads: """"On May 20, Presley’s bodyguards were involved in a fight with a drunk man outside Presley’s hotel suite. The man had been asked to leave the hallway, but became aggressive and began punching and kicking anyone near by. Presley was entertaining his daughter Lisa Marie at the time, and upon hearing the commotion outside, reached for his guns. This was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping, and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”. The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and David Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement, but Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident (he had punched the man while he was handcuffed). David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that this was one of the reasons West would later be fired.""""

According to Peter Guralnick and the complainant Presley witnessed this """"fight"""", more like an assault, but did nothing to stop it. Four men held the man down, """"and the rest beat him to a bloody pulp."""" As David Stanley was part of this, and the author of the above account, I think he might be a teeny bit biased in his own favour. Jerry Hopkins' book concurs with this. 

I suggest: On May 20, Presley’s bodyguards were involved in an incident with a drunk man outside Presley’s hotel suite. The man had thrown breaker switches and several men followed by Presley poured into the darkened hallway. This was during the Patty Hearst kidnapping and, according to David Stanley, “Elvis feared for Lisa’s safety”, who was staying in the suite at the time. When the lighting was restored, four men including David Stanley, held the man while three others """"beat him to a bloody pulp."""" The incident resulted in a lawsuit against Sonny West, Dick Grob and Stanley. Although not physically involved in the attack, Presley was also named on the lawsuit. It was resolved a year later with an out of court settlement. Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fans who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that this was one of the reasons West would later be fired. (citations to be added of course).

I think this anecdote is a good tie-in with the book West & co would publish. It could go in the Memphis Mafia article if needed; for this article it might need trimming a bit.   

I like the rewrite above. I'm torn now about whether to include it in the article, though. Part of me thinks it's important because it is one of the few noteworthy things Presley actually got involved in between 1974 and 1976 (Most of that time was touring), and it does bring a better understanding to the firing of West and co. Another part of me agrees it could be shortened, but each time I read it I struggle to decide which parts should be removed as I find it all important. Perhaps removing the line; Presley was not happy with the way Red West had conducted himself during the incident, but fans who witnessed it claimed that Presley simply stood by doing nothing to stop the beating. and just going straight from the settlement into David Stanley recalled Presley telling him later that Wests' aggressive beating of the man was one of the reasons he would later be fired.

Good Article it could use a bit of revising but we can worry about that later. Returning to the discussion about the coint,,,uhhh guys Hannibal is Phoenician(Caanite,Yemen Migrents) Caanite(yemen Migrents Berber(yemen Migrents) Carthaginian Arab

Berbers: 

Berbers are the original and first inhabitants of North-Africa, in other words, they are the natives of this part of Africa. The name by which they are called (berbers) comes from the noun """"barbarians"""" (in english). And this, because Romans used to call All those who didn't speak their language  """"barbarians""""... And actually, there are only us who are still called like this ^_~ why did they use this term, they just use this noun without any feeling of a pejorative meaning. But to call themeselves in their language (Tamazight), they use """"imazighen"""": the plural of """"Amazigh"""". 

Many people ask about our origins, and I always say that this question is sensless! it's like asking what is the origins of the Indians! Indians Don't have the same eyes as chinese but they are considered as asians so Just think about us (it's an order!) that We are berbers Thus we are Africans! 

Don't forget that those who first were called africans were berbers, when you study about Rome and byzantine at school, you've probably heard about carthage and africans? these africans were the great Phoenicians,Berbers (arabs). Hence the Carthaginian Arabs. 

But we can answer to which race the berbers belong to, As you know (I'm sure you don't know!^^') there are 3 races in the world: 

The Caucasoid race (Europeans, Jews/hebrews, Arabs ...etc.) 

The Negroid Race. (Blacks) 

The Mongloid Race. (chinese, japanese ...etc.) 

Berbers are predominately Caucasoid (berbers of the sahara are mixed with sub-saharans), Their language is close to the Language spoken by the old egyptians (Pharaohs...), in other words they speak an Afro-asiatic language (Hebrew, Arab, assyrian, Old egyptian, Berber...etc.) SEMETIC! XD 

To see how berbers look like click google 

To know how berber language sounds (through music) download this MP3 by clicking google 

The lands where berbers lived in the past, were from the west of Old Egypt to the Canary-islands, But now, Berbers constitute only 25% of the population in Algeria and 40% in morocco, the berbers of the canary islands (called guanches) are spanish now and they've lost their language.

In this way, the historical origins of the NW African Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African Upper Paleolithic (H35, H36, and H38), 13% Neolithic (H58 and H71), 4% historic European gene flow (group IX, H50, H52), and 8% recent sub-Saharan African (H22 and H28).""""

While the origins of the Sumerians, whose language appears related to no known linguistic family, remain a mystery, the other people of the region were chiefly Semites - Canaanites (the Levant), Amorites (southwestern desert people), Akkadians and Assyrians (Mesopotamia), Arameans, Habiru (Hebrews) and Bedu (Beduin Arabs of the southern desert). The languages of these groups are closely related, and also related more distantly to Hamitic languages, which include ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian.

Throughout the Bronze Age there was a sporadic influx of nomads from Arabia into the area, hostile at first, but soon incorporated into the existing culture. Later, Indo-European peoples migrated into the area. Among them were the Hurrians, who moved from Turkey in the North to Iraq in the 3rd milleneum BCE and brought the light horse-drawn chariot and composite b",0

About Yaron Matras (Madaares)' edits

Yaron Matras, non-Romani Professor in Linguistics at the University of Manchester, with the username  keeps adding the mention that the Ḍom -> Rom theory is the mainstream, an obvious personal POV. Yes, it has anteriority as compared to Rajput -> Rom theory, but is certainly no mainstream. It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status. The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the anti-Romani stereotypes and prejudices. There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin. Plus, the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group, it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names. On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific. And if it finds supporters mostly among non-Roma, as fitting their ideas about Roma, this does not mean it is mainstream. The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide.

I did not have previous encounters with Yaron Maras, but I see that this first one does not look at all as a positive one. I am not a member of any """"Romani Union of Romania"""" and I don't know of the existence of any such union. It is sad that he resorts to such cheap intimidations, probably fitting himself the image of those non-Romani researchers who """"seem to feel threatened by Romanies who are educated or who are branded as ‘activists,’ as though this were automatically a bad thing"""" as presented by Ian Hacock at Romani Origins and Romani Identity: A Reassessment of the Arguments. Is this a new proof that the Romani studies done by some non-Romanies are some of the last contemporary studies made in a colonialistic style?  """,0

"""==Correct and True Etymology of English words """"Myth, Mythology""""==
Greek μυθολογια """"legend, storytelling"""" is derived from μυθος """"speech, thought, story, myth"""", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning """"an exposition of myths"""". The current meaning of """"body of myths"""" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of """"untrue story"""":

""""These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history."""" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)

This is the earliest known usage of """"myth"""" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English """"fabulous"""" doesn't mean """"wonderfully aesthetic"""", it is the adjectival form of """"fable"""", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term """"myth"""" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things """"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history."""".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define """"myth"""" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.  (ውይይት) 

In 2005, a single-purpose account added """"mythology categories"""" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of """"mythology"""" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  

Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article """"Yoruba mythology"""" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term """"mythology"""" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from """"mythology"""", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as """"mythology"""".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran """"mythology"""" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today """"mythology"""".    (ውይይት) 

Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as """"mythology"""" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of """"mythology"""" for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.  (ውይይት)

There's always one guy who'll say, """"Meh, close enough.""""  I suppose I'm him, here, but, at the same time, you're absolutely correct.

(I think with Layamon the argument is sometimes that it the consonant became /y/ in his case, so modern editors feel like they're helping readers by making him more obviously Lawyerman.  All such things are excuses, though.)  Given that we are always already out of compliance with some browser or OS (e.g. does anyone know how far """"Windows MediaCenter"""" or """"Longhorn"""" are going to shove the old fonts out of whack), the kludge-y but best solution might well be to use an unusable typographical symbol (*, ^, #) and have a """"Key"""" that indicates that that symbol was used for the yogh.  That would be the most honest way to do it, but it won't give the uninitiated any way to understand it.  They won't attempt to read it in their heads (assuming they can read thorn, eth, and ash now).

1)What do you mean by """"passing"""". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries """"enforce"""" these requirements?

3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?

4) Most importantly, since the term """"required"""" calls for a resource by which adherence to this """"requirement"""" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through """"blind trust"""") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.

what i was upset about was not content but behavior - namely edit-warring.  People disagree about content all the time.  What our policies and guidelines call us to do when there are disagreements about content - how to behave - , is to stop editing the article and start talking, and keep talking until there is agreement about what to do about content.  Please keep these two kinds of issues distinct.  
Most admin boards (3RR, AIV, ANI, etc) are for behavior issues.  Dispute resolution (DR) talks about how to resolve content disputes, none of which involve going to the admin boards.   
 However, none of the various DR tools are available to us until we have tried to work things out on the Talk page, and we have barely started talking there.  The """"fresh start"""" discussion on Talk is the kind of thing we do for content disputes - we back up and talk about the fundamentals of content - namely, sourcing - on the Talk page.

Wow. a pre-emptive attack on an article in preperation for an AfD. Unfortunately, quite miseleading. Hope others don't pay it much heed.  
 """"No evidence of notability of this film."""" False. Notability has been asserted and sourced. FURTHER, the statement seems to absolutely ignore the sorces provided, which in toto amount to enough to meet WP:NF and WP:GNG: This Week, Columbus Dispatch, Athens News, and ABC News all qualify as in-depth coverage from reliable sources. 
 """"No reviews by nationally-known reviewers or publications.""""  Misleading as it does not automatically apply. A cult horror satire film by independent filmmakers is unlikely to be reviewed by Siskel and Ebert, much less those publications that cater to only big-name, big-budget, highly touted blockbusters. Wiki's guideline recognizes that sources may be considered for what is being sourced and accepts that an in-depth review of film and filmmakers by Cranked on Cinema is from experts in the field qualified to voice an opinion about the subject.
 """"even the so-called New York Times reference is in fact to All Movie Guide"""". Gee. WHy mislead with that? The New York Times was not used to source notability... neither was the use of Turner Classic Movies. Again, you are misleading a reader who might best be told that these 2 reliable sources were used to WP:Verify some of the article's non-contentious facts... like existance of film or of cast & crew... which is expected and demanded by guideline AND policy...  specially since notability has already been established by """"significant coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject"""" (but thanks for the hint about AMG... I can now add it as well).
 """"The fact that it is the first feature completed by Ohio State students is not an indication of notability""""  False, as it is for them, and quite specifically meets the criteria set by WP:GNG, even though it is only a secondary and supported claim toward overall notability.
 """"it is not an assertion that it is the first feature completed by university students: would there be an automatic bypass of notability requirements for the first feature completed by students of 'every' college or university?"""" This misleading WP:WAX argument is not about this article... only about some hypothetical article. The sourced minor assertion is that this is the first for Ohio University. Not for any others. Why not handle those article if/when they show up? There is no request being made here for a """"bypass of notability requirements"""" for some other mythical set of as yet unwritten articles. Notability here has been asserted and proven. Period.

Thanks for your reply. I do assume good faith, but the issue here does not concern good or bad faith. The issue is deleting sourced material without any prior discussion or warning. It doesn't matter how much good faith you're bringing - the net result is still the deletion of sourced material. As you point out, there were actually two instances of peremptory deletions by you since the ArbCom case finished just one month ago. Deleting properly sourced material and then daring other users to revert your edit, or requiring them to go through a long discussion to get it restored, are not great ways to relate to your fellow editors and their contributions. In the future, if you have a question about a source, please use one of the many specific templates before further peremptory deletions of cited material.

"""{unblock|reason=The user that reported me made several false claims, such as claims of """"personal attacks"""" regardless of the fact that I have never made any, and """"violating Wikipedia's policies"""" regardless that I have never done so.  He himself has been reported several times for doing bad things like insulting people, and posted directly fraudulent information both to me and apparently to administrators.  I was not given any possibility of replying to the block request discussion, because he also did not link this anywhere on my page and on his page I saw a template (posted to him by a user of a different time he has done this) stating that doing so is required.  Basically, the user who reported me shows clearly in """"bad faith"""". The fact that I am being forced to defend on myself on Wikipedia for 12+ hours is not a valid reason for a block.  No """"personal attacks"""" were made, no """"refusal"""" to do anything was done as no """"orders"""" were given that could be """"refused"""" due to the fact the """"orders"""" did not even happen, and being a victim of others who are repeatedly attacking me and even deleting my replies from discussion pages before archiving, and defending myself from these continuous attacks, is NOT a valid reason for a block.  As for the articles which caused people to attack and harass me, nothing regarding these articles was ever properly done.  No messages asking to discuss it, no polls done to find out which information is correct, no editing done after my edits for the purpose of further improving the article, nothing constructive or reasonable whatsoever, just reverting the entire edit without discussion or reasonableness, lying about the reason for reverting, harassment, and making fraudulent claims against me such as """"adding information without sources"""", regardless of the fact that 1) I did not ADD any information to the article and 2) it is okay to add information that does not have  a source, and most new articles consist mainly, and some entirely, of such information.  Someone wrote something about """"friendly advice,"""" but not a SINGLE related comment was at all """"friendly,"""" and no advice was given whatsoever except for one which was both unhelpful and contained more untrue statements.  Even this administrator is purposefully making blatantly fraudulent statements, claiming that I """"ignored guidelines in regards to my signature"""", regardless of the fact that the one who changed Wikipedia's code to no longer link automatically is not me, nor did they notify me, nor could anyone think of a reasonable reason to do this, regardless of the fact that it has been less then 24 hours since anyone requested that I learn programming code and then re-code my signature to compensate for this flaw, that's right less then 24 hours let alone a reasonable time of 4 months or so (assuming the user has logged in for several hours every day during that time), and regardless of the fact that even in that minuscule amount of time my signature had already been re-coded before he ever did this block.  This shows that the administrator himself is specifically in bad faith by citing an alleged """"problem"""" that no longer even exists.  There is also a log of the LITERAL AND DIRECT EXACT OPPOSITE of the claim of the person who reported me (again, WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME TO REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MATTER), at the Help Desk page.  I advise that people looking at this do not read that conversation as evidence of replies and such, because several of my replies were deleted before the conversation was archived and therefore it is an invalid archive, BUT it does show the exact opposite of this claim in that I specifically complained about someone for doing that very thing because the conversation between MYSELF AND HIM should be done at only ONE place, and should also be done at one of the appropriate pages, rather then being harassive by using different places as this Administrator is claiming I have done when there is direct evidence that I've done the opposite.  So the main thing being that I am the victim of numerous people attacking me, they should not have attacked me but instead should have done any of the things I mentioned, or some other reasonable thing, rather then reverting edits and then attacking and harassing me.  I did not deserve any such harassment and attacks and do have the right to defend such things.  If I am treated fairly instead then there could be a discussion on the matter instead of repeated reverting without any discussion, then no such people would be """"reporting"""", but, since I did not do the things in the report other then correcting articles, and since the decent reply to correcting articles which someone else thinks are incorrect is not to attack them as was done to me, the block is wrong because things should be differently and because the people who were """"edit warring"""" on purpose were other people rather then myself.  In fact, direct evidence of this is ALSO availab",0
""":Now I've checked, and, unfortunately for """"true"""" enthusiasts, Steinberg does not call this work a """"true choral symphony"""".

There is evidence that Vaughan Williams would have agreed with Steinberg and was using the term symphony in the title more or less figuratively, roughly in the manner that Stravinsky later used it in his Symphony of Psalms. From Ursula's biography, p. 95: """"On of my [Ralph Vaughan Williams's] most grateful memories of George [Butterworth] is connected with my London Symphony....he [Butterworth] said in his characteristically abrupt way: 'You ought to write a symphony.'

 My old pal Sam! 

http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2587275

 My old pal Sam!

Last night I decided to google the name of the most despised kid in my hometown. I went to school with him for 9 years and have a whole list of horror stories. His name is legendary in the childhood memories of my friends and I. Sam.

Sam was the kid who ate cat food at lunch. Sam was the kid who always smelled like shit (moreso on the occasions he actually shit himself). Sam has a collection of awesome dragon shirts. Sam was a genius, too. It always puzzled me what he was doing barely passing his classes in elementary and middle school. Perhaps his superior mind just wandered. Sam would often tell us about and draw pictures of his English girlfriend, who flew to america every weekend to fuck him. On special occasions Sam would share with us selections of the many books he had written. Yeah Sam had it made.

So I was curious of the life Sam was leading now, a year after he has graduated High School. Is he returning for his sophomore year at Oxford? Is he happily married to his stick figure with huge tits?

well, I've kept him in the dark long enough, so say hello to Sam!

I occasionally have a girlfriendusually a girl who thinks """"This nice, sweet guy ain't got the best body, but I'm sure he'll put me before anything else."""" and how wrong they were!

"For people familiar with the background for these articles, it's easy to figure out the notability, because you just know. 
 The problem with the articles is that in themselves, they don't really have much by way of explaining why they are notable or how come they are verifiable, as per policy. 
 So no matter who does it or what you think of any particular nominator, sooner or later these pages will be back on articles for deletion, unless they get improved.
 In the case of PZFUN, in fact he has many featured articles under his belt. He also got slandered by Siegenthaler on national television and held his ground.

 Please read WP:EDITSUMMARY and take your own advice.  To answer your allegations, insinuations and questions:
If you check my contribs, you may note that I'm a slightly busy editor, with far more obligations on Wiki and articles on my watchlist than only Chavez.  When you make an incorrect edit, it pops on my watchlist and I correct it.  Doing any more for now in the current environment of WP:BATTLEGROUND and WP:OWN is not possible.  When/if the article ever settles down to consensual and collaborative editing, I'll be more than happy to devote ample time to article improvement.  As it stands, a well-justified POV tag was placed on the article in February, and not a single editor there did a single thing to correct the POV for months, until the current battleground resumed.  You might ask yourself if you have contributed to the battleground or to a collaborative editing environment, particularly with edit summaries like the one noted above.  In the meantime, I can clean up ten medical articles and promote ten FACs in less time than it takes to settle one clear and simple cn tag on Chavez.
The text clearly says a law was enacted; the cited source cleary says a law may be enacted.  The source does not verify the text an updated source is needed.

Speedy deletion of Gjendemsfjellet
 A tag has been placed on Gjendemsfjellet requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

 Editor review 

Hey Nish, I'm currently up for Editor Review. I would be most appreciative if you could comment on my Wikipedia habits there and offer some advice. Thanks in advance.  

Thanks for the Editor Review. I honestly, truely know that I do not want to become a Wikipedia Admin. However, I hold the same thoughts towards Wikipedia as I do towards the US military: Given the choice, I would never join up, but my personal philosophy of national service (I agree with the idea of mandatory national service of some sort, whether it be community service or military) compels me so that I plan to join the US military in some form in the future. 

The problem I currently face with Wikipedia is that I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle in both the preservation of information and the adding of new information to Wikipedia. Often, something that I hope to be small edit becomes a huge issue due to vandalism, edit wars, extremely overly burecratic Wikipedians (example: those who like to delete almost every image from topics under the fair use policy), etc. I don't want to end up like many of the former Admins who came to Wikipedia to add information and stayed because they became Admins and spent all their time putting out fires. However, as Wikipedia will experience exponential growth within the next decade (it will plateau when the Internet finally reaches into the third world in a big way), and with that growth will come a huge number of vandals. Honestly, I believe Wikipedia now can use 10x the number of Admins. I can't even imagine how bad it might get on here (with vandals) in a decade or so when the number of Admins has grown at a steady pace but the number of vandals is huge due to the rapid growth of Wikipedia and the Internet in general.

I would prefer to not be an Admin, but I'm willing to put up with whatever it takes to preserve the good info of Wikipedia while ensuring that new info can be added properly.

Any thoughts on this?  

EDIT: Also, I'd like to expand my Vandal Fighting activities, but I'm not sure if I should get external programs like VandalProof. I do patrol newpages every now and then, and in the process catch many vandals. However, I usually cannot punish these vandals because of the WP:AGF policy and the fact that warnings really do nothing to repeat vandals.  

I'll try my best.

You left this comment on my talk page:
Umm...you stated that you shortened the intro here as per WP:LEAD. We were discussing the intro on the talk page, and I would have appreciated it if you would go back and discuss the intro's status on the talk page. I am restoring back the intro section, and you can make minor changes if you wish, but please don't make drastic changes without discussing. Thanks. By the way, keep up the great work with the article. =) Hopefully we can pull this to GA or FA in the near future. Best, Nishkid64 
I've discussed the article on the talk page: The introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why I shortened it. Please read WP:LEAD which recommends it is concise. Also some of the sentences don't flow well. The first sentence was a Russian Security Service agent [with a link to FSB] and later a Russian dissident is a much better summary than was an ex-FSB lieutenant-colonel with KGB experience in fighting organized crime. Tom .  In order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise.  You restored back the intro' i.e. a major change and said I could make 'minor' changes if I wish but 'had to discuss drastic ones', I hope you realise this is hypocritical, given that you did a major revert without discussing.  As you know, several people on the talk page have suggested to you that the intro was too long.  I promise you, the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one.  The longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence, it goes straight into a narrative without any gap: """"After working in..."""", it doesn't make sense in English,""""his superiors had ordered for the assassination"""" should be """"his superiors had ordered the assassination"""".  You can't be a dissident of an organisation, see dissident.  It's got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of 4 short clearly defined ones. Anyway, hope you're okay, give us a shout and we can talk about it.

"""
No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else.
Few facts:
Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000. 
Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls.
Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the """"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports"""" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing.
Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether """"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas"""" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011.
In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% .
All this means the following:
The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.  
Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling.
However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas.
And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk 
We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead. But if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording, let's discuss them.  Talk """,0

 Our ancestors 

Most of us trace our musical origins to the B's, but, past the B's, everything, and I mean everything is due to The Fans, Pylon, and Vietnam.  The Fans had records on db (Danny Beard = db records).  Their single """"True,"""" in particular, is a fantastic distillation of half of what Athens would be (avail. on """"Squares Blot Out the Sun,"""" a db sampler).  Vietnam was never recorded.  The Fans split up, with Kevin Dunn remaining about the scene as a solo act (Kevin Dunn and the Tribe of Women were on db).  Alfredo Villar, the singer of The Fans, went back to his day job.  

The other thing is Pylon.  There just are    not     words for how important they were/are.  REM's favorite band is Pylon.  The B-52's favorite band is Pylon.  Everyone's favorite band was/is Pylon.

The other huge starting point is in Atlanta.  The Hampton Grease Band, despite being Atlantans, was a kick off to the whole idea that we could be weird and successful.  Although they claim that """"Music to Eat"""" sold fewer albums than any in Columbia history (not true, as a Yoga instructional record undersold them), they looked successful to us because they had integrity and played and got to pay their bills that way.  In particular, although that band's career was very brief, Bruce Hampton never went away.  Both in The Late Bronze Age and Aquarium Rescue Unit later, as well as the various incarnations as Hampton B. Coles and Colonel Bruce Hampton, he was a magnet for musicians.  Furthermore, Glenn Philips, who played guitar with the Grease Band when he was 15 years old, stuck around and continued to gig.

I'm a stinkin' expert on Athens 1980 - 1986.  After that, I quit my band and wandered away to academia, but I was one of Them back then.   """,0

 On the goodness of description and evil of prescription 

The article on grammar suggests in many ways that teaching people how to listen and read is good, but teaching them how to speak and write is wicked. Linguists are said to be concerned """"normally"""" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter. The notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate, when seeking such help, and when making such decisions ourselves, is not only perverse and deplorable, but also patently wrong.

Scholars of the historical Jesus use the historical method and Israeli archeology to reconstruct a biography of Jesus. They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his. The so-called quest for the historical Jesus began with Hermann Samuel Reimarus and continues today with scholars such as the fellows of the Jesus Seminar.""""

To Cool Hand Luke: I ask for your help as an administrator with this problem.

 From the Wikipedia deletion guidelines:

Deletion process

    Main article: Wikipedia:Deletion policy

Deletion of articles from Wikipedia occurs through one of three processes.

     2. Another quick method is the use of proposed deletion: simply add 
 to the top of the article. This is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial, yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. A proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days, and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full AFD process is required.

I thought I complied with this policy, it seems to say that """"any user"""" can """"contest"""" the proposal by """"removing"""" the tag. It seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. Beyond meeting the criteria's specifics, the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.

I believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of Wikipedia, and that the proposal to delete, along with the reasons given, which I believe are not in good faith, therefore violates various Wikipedia policies.

The evidence for this belief includes (1) the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion; (2) the user's prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of (as demonstrated by his reasons or comments) to the subject of the article proposed for deletion; (3) the fact that I have worked on this article in the past; (4) the fact that this user on or about the same day and time, in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me, proposed two other articles that I have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in; (5) proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before I or anyone else had a chance to object (Wikipedia is not a full time job for most users, who only visit the site from time to time, and note also the stated policy that there are """"no emergencies on Wikipedia,"""" the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass, redirected the article to another article, effectively deleting the original article. In fact the redirect was effect as I was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay, and when I hit save, the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost; (6) he gave me three rapid succession warnings (in bad faith, for what I believe were good faith acts on my part) and had me blocked before I could make a response to his """"warnings""""; it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.

It seems quite clear in light of the above, and further facts that can be marshalled in support, that this user's intent is (1) not supported by facts or policies, (2) not in good faith, (3) in retaliation, and therefore (5) in violation of Wikipedia policy.

Recognizing this, I communicated to this user that I would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement, by not making any further comment on the talk page of Tort Reform. I had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not, as the user had made the dispute personal.

As for my being blocked by you as per the 3-revert rule, I must point out that I do not believe the rule applies to what I did, because I was (1) making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption, (2) the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a user's (his) apparent violations; (3) rather than reply, he deleted the warnings and requests to stop; (4) did so more than three times, in violation of the rule; (5) in bad faith, turned the rule on meI did not delete anything, and technically, I did not revert anything either, I think, but was adding to previous posts, and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a NEW post.

Other indications of bad faith:

The user asserts that I committed """"vandalism"""" to the entry on Sonic's Rendezvous Band by removing the delete tags. My reply is (1) I did so in accordance with policy; (2) it is not """"vandalism"""" to remove",0
"You did not disprove the fact that Safavids spoke Turkic and Ismail wrote poetry (published by Minorsky) in Azeri Turkic. None of the facts you brought above disproves either these facts or a slew of Iranica and other references I brought above. Nowhere, does the page say Ismail is a Turk, his grandfather Uzun Hassan was a Turk, Ismail was born in Aqqoyunlu Turkic state, and we show his background as mixed Turkic, Kurdish and Greek. There is NO reference above whatsoever to say Ismail was ethnic Persian, NONE! No reference that he or his ancestors considered Persian (that is South-Western Iranian dialect) as their mother tongue. Language used by Uzbeks has no relevance to Safavid discussion, Ismail extensively used Chagatay dialect in his poetry oriented to Qizilbash Turkomans. This is a fact spelled out by Vladimir Minorsky in his article on Ismail's poetry. Read it through the end, instead of opening only the last page of the article after pages of his Turkish poetry. 
The problem is you're trying to attribute Iranian to Persian, in modern meaning these are different things. Safavis were not Persian.

In order to facilitate reference to talk page discussions, I will need to create an archive page for the talk page content that one of the admins previously blanked.  Is there any problem with that?  

You can link to a permanent revision in the history if need be, so long as the page was not actually deleted.  

As far as I know, nothing was permanently deleted, although some discussions have been moved to archive pages.  The other thing I need to exhibit is the blocking message that KillerChihuahua posted.  That one does not appear in any revision of this talk page; it appears on a template that I see on my user page, but I don't think others see that template.  How do I reference or exhibit that original blocking message?  

Just go into the history, and click the appropriate date on a revision.  That will bring you to a page, with a link.  Here is an example, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moulton&oldid;=157221709.

As an aside, what will you do if unblocked?  Do you intend to edit articles again?  

How do I link to something that exhibits KillerChihuahua's original blocking message, wherein she gives the reason for blocking?  

It's too soon to decide what I will do if unblocked, as that depends on what transpires during the course of these proceedings.  If the objectives I set forth in my RfC are embraced and endorsed, then it's reasonable to imagine that it would be feasible for people like me to contribute to the crafting of mainspace articles.  If those objectives are repudiated by ArbCom, then there would be no point in editing articles, even if I were provisionally unblocked on technical grounds related to denial of due process. 

I have one other question on how these cases are titled.  Is there any standard convention on titling these cases?  

this is your block log.  Tilting?  

Not tilting, but titling.  Do I entitle the case """"Moulton"""" or """"Moulton v. KillerChihuaha"""" or """"KillerChihuahua"""" since she is the admin whose actions I am contesting.  

No vs.  You are verses anything.  You are requesting a unblock review to ArbCom.  """"Moulton"""" works.  

I have filled in the RfAr Template, and (unless you spot any deficiencies), I believe it is now ready for posting.  Would one of you (Nathan or Anthony) please do the honors? Thank you.

 Using Joan Roth as a source for Bukharan history 

The website of photographer Joan Roth is being used as a source for the assertion that the Bukharans are Jews whose ancestors did not return from the Babylonian captivity.  I humbly submit that while Joan Roth may be an expert photographer, she is not an expert historian.  If someone wants to use her as a history source, email her (I'd do it myself, but I don't have time presently) at JoanLRoth@aol.com, and ask her for her sources for her assertion.  If those sources are found to be sound historically, then they can be used as reliable sources.  In the meanwhile, notice that the Jewish Encyclopedia clearly indicates that no history of the community is reliably known prior to less than a millennium ago.  talk """,0

 Neutrality? 

""""There are also allegations that the attention and sympathy especially from the Australian public and media may be related to xenophobic sentiment and a unfair mistrust of Asian legal systems. Also, many think there was no motive for Corby to transport marijuana from Brisbane to Bali where the value is far less, and where it is readily available on the street not far from her prison (and even within it), i.e. it would be like smuggling ice to Eskimos.""""

This seems POV to me.  (Of course, in the interests of full disclosure I believe that she is guilty).

I added some referencing to a Sydney Morning Herald article where it was alleged that Australian marijuana (in particular hydroponically grown marijuana) sold quite well in Bali for a few reasons:
 Indonesian marijuana is quite poor in quality - rich tourists generally prefer the Australian stuff.
 Due to the lack of entrapment laws in Indonesia, tourists can often be caught by Balinese police stings - and so prefer to buy their marijuana off other whites, who are less likely to be members of the Indonesian police.

I can understand the text on the (turns out to be non-lethal) white powder being sent to the embassy being removed.  I believe that even though a link hasn't been established between the two events that this incident will have a bearing on the case, and especially its portrayal (spelling?) in Indonesia, but I can see why the lack of a clear connection between the two events has led to its removal.

That said, I cannot understand why the text on """"smuggling ice to Eskimos"""" is allowed to remain whereas the text from the Sydney Morning Herald, a respected (within Australia at least) news source is not.  If the view that there would be no point smuggling marijuana to Indonesia is allowed to remain, why not the view that there would be a point, especially if that view is put forward by a major Australian newspaper?  The article seems POV and biased in favour of Corby to me.

RE: MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

 Removal of poorly sourced claims about vegetarianism

The source that claims Mujica is not a vegetarian is dubious; it appears to be an opinion piece by someone who opposes the president's lifestyle.

 Errors in Listing 

There are a number of errors in this list.
The short 25 pounder is an Australian designed & built pack gun. It fired standard 25 pounder ammunition & was designed using the standard 25 pounder (which was being licenced built in Australia at the time) as a starting point but little else in common.
The M777 is actually a combined USA/UK origon. The weapon was designed in UK & all the titanium parts are made there, the barell is designed & made in USA & the finished weapon is assembled there (Britian does not at this point field this weapon)
Two different imperial sized guns are listed with the same metric dimensions which can't be correct (I believe the 8"""" gun is correct but not the 9.2"""" gun).
I don't believe any of the L5 pack howitzers are still in use. The army reserve stopped using them some time in the 1990's.
The F2 mortar is a UK/Canada design. Australia announced in 2012 it was looking at replacing the current F2 motar, therefore I would be very supprised if it only came into service in 2010 (it was designed in the 1960's).

Dear Yiyu,

Don't work too much on the Mao article here  whatever you agree on will have no real strength behind it because you are not working with other editors, and when you polish something together, it will ultimately be destroyed by those that had no part in it.

You also need to watch out for what wikipedia calls """"weasel terms"""" that are used in the draft above.   """"weasel terms"""" are ways of saying thing that really avoid the issue.  If an editor says """"some analysts believe"""", it really means """"I don't know who believes it, but I want it in this article"""".

Unfortunately, the current wiki has no way to decide """"truth"""" and """"lies"""".   The best you can do is present all sides (not just one, or two) and cite evidence.     For everything that is a lie, you can add sentences describing why it is untrue.  There have been some movements to give weight to editors that are educated in one area more than those that are just shooting their mouths off, but they have failed.  As we all know, many times history has been distorted and many people have been fooled, so don't be too sure that you know what really happened, when all most of us really have are hand-me-down stories.

Lastly, be sure not to get too wrapped up in articles.  Find other articles to edit and your experience will be much more fulfilling.   Come to visit Mao often, and put it on your watchlist, but don't let it consume you or sour you on wikipedia.   I can guarantee you that 10 years from now, there will STILL be edit wars on the Mao page.  Working through the night to make a perfect article won't stop someone from getting up in the morning and ruining your delicate balancing act.  You probably have great insight into many things that are completely uncovered in Wiki  give those a try sometime.

Hope this helps,

 GISIN page edits 

Thanks for your attention to the GISIN wiki page.  However, RE: your removal of """"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (""""Draft"""" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a """"live"""" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.  (He actually requested that the GISIN Wikipedia entry be DELETED if this weren't made clear.)

So... any way you could see fit to re-include that text (or something similar that would serve the same purpose)?

(P.S. - As I think about it, in truth, the onus should really be on the maintainer of the linked sites to ensure that anyone that got to that URL would knowin terms that the site author wants folks to knowthat it """"should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""".... hmmm...

"Unlike anarcho-capitalists, anarchists believe there is little to no difference between threat of physical violence as a means of coercion and political or economic coercion. Thus the libertarian socialist argues that the anarcho-capitalist distiction between economic coercion, which they allow by the centralized accumulation of productive property and wealth, and physical corecion is an untenable dichotomy. Freedom only comes from a society in which all have equal bargaining power.

This seems to suggest violence is bad, but gives to alternative method of ensuring cooperation and surrender of the means of production. Will you save up and legitamately buy them? How will you aquire such means of production?  08:51, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)",0

 Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia 

The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities, who state it is from La Fontaine's Fables, but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaine's Nouvelles Contes. The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière. The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer, which I found illustrated at  (Accessed ) where it is described as follows:

Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaine's Contes 1785-90Dark blue ground, rich gilding of scrolls, foliage trails and vases. Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes, identified in gilt writing on the underside: on the cup """"la jument du compere pierre"""", and on the saucer """"le diable de papefiguiere"""". No marks. Height of cup 6.1 cm, diameter of saucer 12.9 cm. Circa 1785-90.

This cup is of the Sèvres """"gobelet litron"""" shape. Although unmarked, the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period, such as the Duc d'Angoulême's (Dihl & Guérhard). The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine, which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one, with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen. Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village…

The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon, but I think the story is less straightforward. I haven't found an English translation yet, but it seems to me to be a variation of a well-known folk theme in which Satan/devil/demons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple. An English example would be the folk song """"The Devil and the Feathery Wife"""".  | Talk """,0

That explains how certain features don't appear to be geographically-correct. Further to 117Avenue's comments here, I have the following:
portions of St. Albert's boundaries are incorrect, particularly:
southwest boundary should follow the shoreline of Big Lake; and
northeast boundary is incorrect (refer to this CRB map);
the Sherwood Park Urban Service Area boundary south of Wye Road appears to be a tad exaggerated in terms of size (please double-check, referring to the above linked CRB map);
although the Sherwood Park Freeway is """"technically"""" numbered Highway 100, it is not signed as such, so I recommend removal (note this other CRB map, which was prepared by Alberta Transportation, labels it as """"S.P.F."""" with no background shield or oval);
numerous arterial roads in Edmonton are missing further to those recently identified by 117Avenue (I recommend using the Edmonton TMP's Figures 3.9, 4.1, and 7.1 as a starting point for what roads within Edmonton should be included);
numerous equivalent arterial roads in St. Albert (i.e., Levasseur Rd, Meadowview Ave/McKenney Ave/Bellerose Dr, Grandin Rd, Sturgeon Rd, Dawson Rd, Hogan Rd) and Sherwood Park (i.e., Sherwood Dr between Broadmoor and Brentwood, Granada Blvd, Petroleum Way/Lakeland Dr, Clover Bar Rd north of Hwy 16, Twp Rd 534 along the northernmost boundary) are missing;
the applicable St. Albert roads that actually extend to its municipal boundary should be extended as well;
I'd also like to see RR 231, 232, and 233 (extensions of Sherwood Park's Clover Bar Rd, Brentwood Blvd, and Broadmoor Blvd) shown between Sherwood Park and Hwy 628; and

 Peak Ground Acceleration of Tohoku Earthquake? 

The Wikipedia article titled """"2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami"""" shows the peak ground acceleration of the March 11 quake at 2.99 g on the right sidebar and has the statement """"Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) calculated a peak ground acceleration of 2.99 g (29.33 m/s²)."""" under the heading """"Energy"""".  The Wikipedia article titled """"Fukushima I nuclear accidents"""" has the statement """"The 9.0 MW Tōhoku earthquake at 14:46 JST on Friday, 11 March 2011 resulted in maximum ground accelerations of 0.56, 0.52, 0.56 g (5.50, 5.07 and 5.48 m/s2) at units 2, 3 and 5 respectively,"""" under the heading """"Direct effect of the earthquake and tsunami"""".  Is this because the ground acceleration at units 2, 3, and 5 is a local ground accelration at the reactors while the 2.99 g mentioned in the Tohoku Eartqauke article was measured at the epicenter?  The information indicated for peak ground acceleration between the two articles is somewhat confusing.  """,0

 Would you take on a project?? 

There are two users, currently both with a week-long block for edit warring over an article Che Guevara (photo), although the blocking admin is vacillating, suggesting an RFC which I know is useless. One of the editors, User:Redthoreau, I tangled with a while ago and ultimately ended up nominating the article in question for FAR, Wikipedia:Featured article review/Che Guevara/archive1. The other editor User:Damiens.rf I don't know, but his current complain is that 61 quotations in an article is too many. 

The blocking admin User talk:EdJohnston wants to handle the situation constructively but does not know how. I suggested to him that someone like you, an experienced editor might be willing to be a neutral editor between the two, focused on article quality.

I suggested you (and perhaps also User talk:Geometry guy) to direct the warring editors to concentrate on article quality. My experience in the past with User:Redthoreau is that he does rather well when a """"father figure"""" type takes an interest. Some of his obnoxiousness, I believe, is due to youthful aggression and ignorance. I think he would respond positively to someone whose goal was to produce a quality article. As he dominates all things Guevara, the only way to improve the Guevara articles on Wikipedia is to move  Redthoreau over onto the side of the forces of good.

Since the focus would just be this one article, and your job would be to render advice/judgement on article criteria, I think the job would not be unduly burdensome. Redthoreau had a past mentor-like relationship with User:Coppertwig and did very well when pointed in the right direction behaviourally. (Of course, you may not be quite the right model there!)

Would you consider taking on this project? It might be just up your alley. I figure that since Redthoreau is not going to go away, he may as well put all that energy into writing articles that don't have 61 quotations in them. How about it?  — (Talk) """,0

Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process.

"""Here's another nice quote from Li from the Essentials:

Most fundamentally, you all still need to establish your great mighty virtue in the process of shattering the old forces’ persecution, and return to your highest positions. So this isn’t a matter of reaching Consummation in ordinary realms, nor is it achievable in ordinary Consummation. It might seem that you have done what you should do for Dafa, when actually, you are doing it for your comprehensive Consummation and return. If during this period you cannot do well with what you should do, this Consummation stage can only be a cultivation process, and it cannot fundamentally be a Fa-rectification disciple’s true and final Consummation. If during the evil’s persecution a Dafa disciple doesn’t do well or slacks off, it’s very possible all his previous efforts will have been for nothing.

In other words, if you can't live up to the challenge of """"shattering the old forces's persecution"""" you can't consider yourself a Fa-rectiication disciple.  And what distinguishes a """"Fa-rectificatrion disiciple""""  from an common ordinary disciple?  Well, it's what you do to protect the Master's Fa against the evil forces, isn't it?   Elsewhere the Master actually says this is you duty as a practitioner.  If there any practitioner/editor on this site who has the decency and honesty to acknowledge that these teachings are real and important for your salvation?  Olaf,can you at least intervene and spare us from another endless series of endless discussions on this topic?

...which is the reason why I first discuss it, then change it.  An edit war is nothing pretty, you  know?  We'll see.  Anyway, what you write is largely true, but misleading. Especially:

- Free oxygen, free fluorine and moisture surely will corrode the metallic walls.  However, the chemical potential of the salt has to be controlled anyway so it is slightly on the reducing side, containing some trivalent uranium.  So any free oxygen or fluorine will oxydize the uranium ions, not the metal structure.  Moisture will be driven out with the off-gas at working temperatures.  All this is pretty much a non-issue.

- Cryolithe.  Yes, aluminium is produced by electrolysing alumina with cryolithe.  This can be considered a mixture or solution of sodium flouride, aluminium fluoride and aluminum oxide, certainly a molten salt.  But the cryolithe is really only a fluxing agent, it is chemically non-agressive and it doesn't extract aluminium or something.  You hinted that it does, which  is really misleading.

- Heating is not a technological issue.  Sure, it adds to the cost, but other than that there's no problem.  A power reactor would run quite some time without ever being cooled down, refuelling is done by adding some molten or even solid salt, without shutdown, cooling or heating.  

- But tritium is a problem.  To slow down tritium formation, the lithium in the salt has to be almost pure Li-7, and even then tritium will form.  Tritium in the salt is no problem, it doesn't attack metals.  Tritium migrating from the salt is a problem.  ORNL says, they were able to chemically trap the tritium in the secondary cooling loop.  A problem, yes, but nothing major.

And of course there are the political issues.  An MSR doesn't fit into the """"razor-blade"""" business model currently employed, research is still needed, and that is expensive, waste reprocessing is currently illegal (though this is stupid when also applied to pyroprocessing), and uranium is too cheap these days to make a breeder economically viable.

(Yes, if we can find some agreement, I'll summarize this and move it to the article proper.)""",0

 Various explanations 

The Law School is the only other major graduate school that belongs to UM, so I added it to the intro with the Med School and Marine School.

There is not enough content to split off to make into a separate article on the Business School just because the GA reviewer said that it could be split off.

None of the links to the Miami Herald or Sun Sentinel articles actually point to the articles that they used to because they've been kicked off to the archives.

A whole paragraph dedicated to the strike is not necessary considering that there is a mention of the strike two paragraphs earlier.

I don't know why the Iron Arrow paragraph was removed at all. This just looks like more of Racepacket's bias against its inclusion.

 Statistics

PROPOSED ADDITION:

Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

""":::Agreed, a timeline would be helpful  perhaps a comparative timeline that shows events from both the perspective of the attackee and the attacker.  The major problem I see in doing this is that using only secondary sources, which I assume is desired, will result in an attackee timeline, for events during the attack, that's composed largely of McGonagle's recall of the attack (i.e., COI findings about events during the attack, and their sequence, are almost exclusively based on McGonagle's testimony; and the NSA History Report used the COI findings as a reference source).  So, for the attackee, the timeline may represent the """"official view,"""" as reported in NSA's History Report; but its base information source, McGonagle testimony, can be easily shown as being fraught with errors.  Nonetheless, as long it's made clear to readers that the timeline is based on secondary sources, and that there is contention about the reliably of the secondary sources' references, then I suppose it would be a fair representation of the matter.

(r to my favorite editor, started before Spotfixer commented:)
Not months, years. He'd been shoveling that shit on Shapiro since 2006. Anyway, thanks for the kind words - coming from one in your time and place it's especially touching that you'd be aggrieved over my two week time out from a website.
I often despair of ever getting anything done here. The most basic, obvious, and straightforward applications of policy often take many man-hours, and even a victory never establishes any kind of precedent - the same discredited arguments are just brought to a new forum. Outright deceit goes unpunished; editors say X=100, citing a source that says X=-5, and get away with it. I mean, look at my own block log, for example.
The first time I was blocked, it was because a devotedly Jewish and obsessively Zionist admin baited me until he ran out of his 3 reverts - he actually put """"rv#1, rv#2, rv#3..."""" in his edit summaries - then, literally five minutes later, a notorious """"kamikaze edit warrior"""" with a laser-like focus on Israeli-Palestinian articles shows up to make his first ever edit to the article, I revert him, and then I've crossed the magic 3RR trip wire and I'm blocked. Ffs, even the guy that blocked me - who incidentally was a United States Air Force reservist with a combat record over Afghanistan - ended up scolding Humus Sapiens for his actions. But no sanctions, of course - that's reserved for people who say """"fuck"""" or click """"undo"""" four times instead of three, not for deranged ethno-nationalists who conspire in secret. Those types get admin bits instead, in honour of all the vandalism they've cleansed from articles about Pokemon.
The second time I was blocked, it was because I lost my temper with a semi-literate buffoon, who quoted in boldface """"huge numbers of Palestinians were also driven out of their homes by their own leaders and/or by Arab military forces"""" claiming it supported his text, """"the vast majority of Palestinians fled of their own accord."""" He quoted this triumphantly, as if he had convincingly refuted my argument and exposed me as a liar. The microcephale in question now appears to be on track to becoming an admin. He'll be in good company.
This is not an anomaly. Just prior to my block, I was working on the lede of our article on the 2008 Gaza war, which for some reason still bears a euphemistic title """"Israeli-Gazan conflict"""" or some such nonsense. The lede claimed that """"other Palestinian estimates differ"""" from the """"Hamas-run"""" Gazan hospital system; the only relevant article cited, a piece in the conservative """"home team"""" Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, actually noted a very close correlation between Ministry of Health estimates, endorsed by the World Health Organization, independent estimates, and even the Israeli estimate of overall fatalities (although IDF insists that the number of combatants was far greater, but only off the record and without specifics.) Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about """"incivility"""" and """"personal attacks"""" when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so. I am sick of dealing with this kind of bullshit. What can I say, my patience is not unlimited.
I don't mean to make this out as if every editor who has a pro-Israel point of view is some kind of Satanic monster. I respect Steve/sm8900. I respect Avraham. I respect Ceedjee (and I still don't know where he stands except that he's downright mean to anybody who doesn't stand with him!) Hell, I even respect JayJG in my own twisted way, at least he's entertaining, if only in the fashion of a heel. But this endless stream of nonsense wears one down. I genuinely enjoy reasoned debate on talk pages, ok? But when people lie, cheat, dissemble, and filibuster, I'm going eventually to blow up. Deal with it.

(I note with irony my own advice to a newbie: Try and keep your cool, because WP seems to take an extremely hard line against """"incivility"""" from editors perceived as pro-Palestinian. They will always portray you as a crazy extremist, so it is best to support your arguments with solid """"mainstream"""" sources. [...] You have to be kind of single-minded, I think. Don't allow any opportunity for them to turn the discussion away from the real issues. Word your comments carefully so they cannot be twisted into some alternate interpretation to be used against you. Even when you know full well that somebody is lying, just say, """"I'm afraid I can't understand how you read the source material in that way: it clearly says XYZ..."""" WP doesn'",0

I added two references. — As to the other issue, there seems to be reasonable interest in some of the more specific topics that may look unlikely at first sight if the context is right, e.g., the recent interest in Burger (100-200/day), the """"lucky strike"""" with AFK that you started (a steady stream of 10-20 since two points turned up that could be meaningfully cross-listed in a couple of frequented places), quite a few of the geo pages that don't automatically seem """"major"""" topics (BB 100-150; Poprad 50-60; Gerlach 50-90), the anthem (40/day for months) etc. Most ultrabroad topics like """"the history / society / culture / nature... of X"""" look like hack jobs − written and rewritten by too many, contested, unmanageable.

The previous comment makes several incorrect statements about Baybayin's status as a script, the origin of its name, and what """"Sanskrit"""" refers to. Baybayin is a single script, like Latin, Arabic or Devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. It is most definitely not a group or family of scripts; no separate """"Sulat Bisaya"""" ever existed, and authentic Kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of Baybayin. There were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of Baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. Scott, Villamor and especially Santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region, even from the same document, shows moer differences than the so-called """"regional scripts"""" written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. Modern """"Kulitan"""" or """"Súlat Kapampangan"""" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it """"sus letras"""" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature. Anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least Paul Morrow's web site """"Ang Baybayin"""", Santamaría's """"El """"Baybayin"""" en el archivo de Santo Tomas"""", Villamor's """"The Old Philippine Writing/La Antigua Escritura Filipina"""", and Marcilla y Martín's """"Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos"""".

"To say anything of the Sikh Gurus taking any inspiration from Bhakti movement is fallacious. Sikh Gurus included the writings of other saints in the Guru Granth Sahib; implying that as taking inspiration from them is false.

From Parasaraprasna, Kapur Singh, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar

 Thus those who see in the origin and contents of the Sikh
movement anything of this VaiSlJavism or the historical Bhakti
movement of the Middle ages, which was based on this VaiSDavism
or cognate propositions, show a complete lack of understanding ofthe
real nature of Sikhism. Beyond the fact that Sikhism is of historical
proximity to this Bhakti movement of the Middle ages, and that it
somewhat partakes of the atmosphere and temper of VaiSDavist
climate, it has not much in common with the latter. Among the
principal features of this climate are its anti-Brahmanical attitude, its
preference for vernaculars26 over Sanskrit, its total surrender theory,
such as Lokacarya's marjara27 doctrine, its stress on devotion through
image-worship rather than through knowledge, and its own peculiar
forms of ritualism, such as caste-marks.

It is easy to demonstrate that similarities of Sikhism with some of
these features are not so intimate or fundamental as to suggest any
direct or indirect borrowing.",0

Originally there was one site given as a source for the Sonja de Lennart claims - www.sonjadelennart.com, a site owned by Eleonora de Lennart and created in February 2008.  A simple glance at this website will show that it is not a reputable source.  Instead, it was fabricated for the sole purpose of fooling Wikipedia.
Unfortunately, the Wikipedia hoax was not detected before answers.com and other websites picked up the false claim of authorship and it was included in an Associated Press article that was widely syndicated.  The success of the hoax in tricking a reporter is now being used to give the hoax legitimacy.

 Please help me end this drama once in for all 

I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I. In response to the MfD, he indicated that he intends to start yet another ban discussion. I'm not sure if he's wanting a topic ban on vandalism as before (which really isn't even a topic) or an all out ban. I did indicate that I would not stay here if I was topic banned, and that I would just assume be renamed to something unaffiliated with me (i.e. Vandal Fighter Missing in Action) and then be fully banned, but thankfully there's no support for either a topic ban or all out ban. It's clear that disengagement is still prefered based on some comments at the MfD discussion. After the original p",0

I do not think I ever said how it began and who's fault it is. I have an opinion and you can guess it, but it's irrelevant. The question is how it can end. Since there are two peoples and one isn't going to kill the other, the only way is to reach some kind of agreement. This agreement cannot be reached while one is determined to destroy the other.

Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Ittō-ryū.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as """"judo"""" or """"kenjutsu"""") is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's """"official"""" name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Ittō-ryū should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included """"Kenjutsu"""" after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use """"Aikijujutsu"""" as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) """"Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu"""".

Regarding the hyphen in """"aiki-jujutsu"""", I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with """"aikijujutsu"""", because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes """"aikijujutsu"""" readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to """"aikijujutsu"""", if anyone feels strongly about it.  """,0

Ah, yes.  You two know that it probably isn't prudent for me to say much about him now.

Instead, let's take a different tack, okay?  
A challenge to those at WP:AN
A number of people have been discussing various moves by me.  In an attempt to help clarify the issues, I respectfully issue the following challenge:
Go to Wikipedia:Requested moves and make a request for Eduardo Perez to be moved to Eduardo Pérez, providing the proper discussion space on the talk page in accordance with the instructions at WP:RM, etc.
Then give everyone who has commented about my moving articles should be given a chance to weigh in on that requested move.  Put together all that collective brainpower, and more importantly, all that spirit of cooperative editing, to work to try to resolve the question of which of those two names should occupy the unique spot available for the article's name, in accordance with our Wikipedia:Naming conventions.
Consider what you could support based on the article as it stands today, with nothing specifically identified as a reference, but with two entries under """"External links"""" to statistics pages.  Based on what I could see, in other words.
Look for and discuss additional sources of information, to support either the """"Eduardo Pérez"""" spelling or the """"Eduardo Perez"""" spelling.
Add appropriate references to the article, if they are """"reliable sources"""".
If anyone who has commented about me in this regard hasn't jumped in of his or her own accord within a couple of days, seek them out and specifically invite their input to achieve the best cooperative result.
This will provide a wonderful opportunity to """"teach by example"""".
Then, no matter where it ends up, we will probably accomplish one thing.  Those who want to talk about naming conventions issues will at least have some little bit of experience with and understanding for the potential issues involved.

History:  This article was started with the name Eduardo Perez more than two years ago, and remained that way until moved to Eduardo Pérez without discussion and no edit summary here 10 Oct 2007 by User:Kolins.  Later, I moved back the undiscussed, unreferenced move of the longstanding name. There have been no edits since, and Talk:Eduardo Perez is a blank slate, unused but for the ubiquitous WikiProjects and BLP boxes filling up a couple of screens.

Or, perhaps it would be even more instructive to add one additional step first.  Let Husond first show you how an old pro, one well versed in the workings of Wikipedia, would handle this.

What bothers me the most is your refusal to consider my point. I never said you don't use the quran. I said you're not an arabic speaker. If you were you'd realize that the tafaseer do not see this as an eclipse, nor does Yusuf Ali's translation match the arabic text. there is neither """"engulfed"""" or """"buried"""" or even """"darkness"""" in the verse in question. There is only the verb khasafa, which means darkened. That's where the word for eclipse comes from """"khosoof"""". The classical interpreters' work is good enough for me. None have suggested it's an eclipse, as i've pointed out in our discussion. As to the charge of personal attacks - I reject it. I said you're neither an arabic speaker nor a muslim. I may be wrong about the latter, but it's obvious you're relying on yusuf ali's translation rather than the original text. I've also said you're vandalizing the page I started, and violating its intent and philosophy. The reason I say this is that you insist on adding your view to the main body of the article before we've settled it first in the discussion page. Now that's vandalism.

 Raiding Or Trading 

Someone put an unsigned comment in my talk page about substituting """"raiding"""" for """"trading."""" The answer I gave there reads as follows: """"You are certainly aware of Francis Drake and his privateer activities. Spanish galleons carrying silver were routinely attacked in the Caribbean and Central America and that is not a Hollywood myth. And when Portugal, 1580 to 1640, was under Spanish rule, Portuguese fortresses in Brazil were frequently attacked by the Dutch. I have a book written by a scholar on the subject documenting such activity, but because it is a bit long, and I do not have much time to put into reading at such lengths, I have been postponing it. The book is not in Amazon, an English translation seems not to exist, and Portuguese booksellers say the book is no longer available for sale.

 Talk of scientific principles is pseudoscience which was discarded in the Renaissance.  Modern science is essentially empirical - it makes experiments and observations.  Theories and principles are secondary and must follow these results whither they lead, whether they make sense or not.  In medicine, simple mechanistic ideas do not suffice to explain many observations.  For example, if you give someone an emetic in a certain way then it is found to have the opposite effect of preventing nausea.  It seems that the doctor-patient relationship plays a considerable part in this and it may be that homeopathy is especially efficacious in this regard.

 Recent edits by dapi 

User dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias

the infobox

some weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check
fast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios
. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.

what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke
, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take
this number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz
really uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this """"trick"""" with tanks:

the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find
1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz """"numbers"""" but now it comes, he totally forgot 
the steppefront
with 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm
. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this
troops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded
~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 
5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.
so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?

while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about 
the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers 
came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).
this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all
the german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with
sources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every
reader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....

dapi comments his changes with """"removing unreliable ed"""" []
he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even
krivosheev becomes """"dubios"""" for user dapi [].
while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his fact
that red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 losses
for the complete """"zitadellecampaign"""" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-
page. so his opinions is not straight...

I note that this is a Honduran source, which may not be admissible under the current """"Honduran newspapers are likely to be mouthpieces for the establishment, so they're not reliable sources"""" view which has been prevailing here, but it's unlikely a pro-Micheletti source, on the other hand, would lie about what Micheletti's formal position is.

 Original founding directors 

You claim: - """"I don't think a school prospectus is a reliable source."""" How so? Surely a school knows who its Board of Directors is?  Not only is it a direct source but by law (in the UK) the information MUST BE CORRECT. To name directors who are not in such a position is a criminal offense under the Company (Disclosures) Act (1985/6 revision and 2002 revision) which also requires the propectus includes the company ID number and the VAT number. As such it is a legal document.

Disclosure of names of directors
8.—(1) Where a company’s business letter includes the name of any director of that company, other than in the text or as a signatory, the letter must disclose the name of every director of that company.
(2) In paragraph (1), “name” has the following meanings—
(a)in the case of a director who is an individual, “name” has the meaning given in section 163(2) of the Act; and
(b)in the case of a director who is a body corporate or a firm that is a legal person under the law by which it is governed, “name” means corporate name or firm name.

Further particulars to appear in business letters, order forms and websites
7.—(1) Every company shall disclose the particulars set out in paragraph (2) on—
(a)its business letters;
(b)its order forms; and
(c)its websites.
(2) The particulars are—
(a)the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered;
(b)the company’s registered number;
(c)the address of the company’s registered office;
(d)in the case of a limited company exempt from the obligation to use the word “limited” as part of its registered name under section 30 of the Companies Act 1985(3) or article 40 of the Companies (Northern) Ireland Order 1986(4), the fact that it is a limited company;
(e)in the case of a community interest company which is not a public company, the fact that it is a limited company; and (f)in the case of an investment company within the meaning of section 833 of the Act, the fact that it is such a company.

I have a suspicion i would like to communicate, but would like to do so without backlash from other users (this sounds much more serious than it is, trust me). Do you have an e-mail or some other form of communication I could use to cantact you?

 Hey Gogo Dodo 

What would be suitable for my AGCorp Page, I do not wish to class it as advertising? It is a description of the company and its history and future plans, this way people can look up about it via Wikipedia?

Please post your response on my discusson page.

Many Thanks,

Thanks, Gogo Dodo, I'll be sure to ask you if I need help... I agree with you, it does seem like quite a project. Seems like he's jumping in a bit too fast... ''''''  talk 

 Re:Blanking own Talk page 

I thought it was slightly strange that he blanked it one minute after recieving the warning. If he didn't blank so soon, I would have left it. But since he continued blanking so I left it be as I know nothing gets solved that way and giving him a warning for blanking his own talk page would be as disruptive. I think it's time for bed as I'm falling asleep on my keyboard. Thanks for the reminder which made me remember policies which I had somehow forgotten after my recent vacation.  talk

A lot of IP adresses and new accounts tend to be like that but instead of reverting their edits, I leave a friendly comment on their talk page. Unfortuntely this doesn't stop them from blanking again as I've just found out. But I guess they just don't what to talk to anyone which kind of defeats the whole purpose of a talk page. Anyway consider the matter off my worrylist D  talk

Also clicking a blue link to a users talkpage which is blank is also a big red flag. Or is it blue flag. Anyway, in this case I look through the page's edit history to find warnings. But sometimes there isn't time for searching as the user could be vandalising at a fairly fast pace, so a warning(depending on the vandalism extent) will be placed on the talk page.  talk

 4RR Mistake? 

Someone is continually placing information about a Manaphy event at List of Pokémon (481-493). I reverted until I was wondering if removing gameplay information repeatedly posted, violates 3RR or not. I would think it would fall under inappropriate content. Does it? >.> -[[User:WarthogDemon|Wart",0
"I don't know very much about the unification timeline in those countries, or about the corresponding articles. I do know that Leti would have described himself as Milanese when in France, Britain, or Amsterdam, and not as Italian. I acknowledge that there is a lot of anachronism on Wikipedia, but have the naieve hope that it can be avoided at least in the articles that I work on and will eventually be fixed elsewhere. I feel like most people on the English Wikipedia know that Milan is in Italy, so we aren't doing them a diservice by being more specific. In short, just because other articles are less precise in their style is no reason to perpetuate that style. Also, I am not entirely sure that the situation is as dire as you describe it in other areas. For example, most residents of Burgundy are refered to as Burgundian rather than French.",0

The problem is that many people think that they can add a page for themselves by posting it under a userpage using an account that represents the company, which is problematic for many reasons. Most of these people don't bother to read the stuff we have written for them nor do they pay attention to that orange bar at the top of the screen. I dare say that some of them are also probably spam bots. There isn't much we can do about this, however all messages used clearly tell the user what they can do next.

Please revert his edit . I cann't because I did that one from before today. Last stronghold does not mean its the last government position in the province. There have been no reports those villages had reverted back to ISIS control. Not to mention the term stronghold refers to fortifications that are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time.

I'm sure we'll get this worked out.  Eldar seems to believe that Conservation International and the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science (CABS)  is a POV source.  That may or may not be, but if the information is supported by reliable authors (seems to be the case as the authors are all scientists in their respective fields) it should be considered reliable.  I'm not sure that particular publication is a """"scholarly article""""; it's officially classified as a """"report"""" and should be treated as such.  That said, if the information checks out, I see no reason not to attribute it and add it to the article.  The same holds true for the second link, which is a reliable technical guideline.   """,0

 Milton Friedman etc. 

I really don't know what I've done or said to produce the attitude you're taking. You can disagree with what I say, although I personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent Klein's inclusion in the Friedman article, and I can be mistaken, as I was in my first reading of the Norberg link, but I don't see how you can take things much beyond that. Nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal, unprovoked insults with which you've decided to base this discourse. You do know, I'm sure, that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy, and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. You seem to take things fair to literally, or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. I don't mean literally that people regard Friedman as a god, and having to explain that feels rather odd but I've decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. It is simply that a large number of economists and right-wingers regard Friedman as something similiar to god, infallible and above normal human standards. If its not Friedman, than its classical economics as a whole, which is apparently beyond any external critique. That, I believe, explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of Friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.

Regarding Klein, you simply don't have a point here, its as basic as that. It it not the place of Wikipedia to judge what is """"right"""" in any particular set of affairs, but to record those opinions which are notable. Klein is a best-selling and well-regarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research, her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of Friedman is one of the most well-known in the contemporary world. It also covers far, far more than Chile. That cannot be dismissed because just because Friedman's supports or, for example, a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. As such, the rights and wrongs of Norberg's critique are fairly irrelevent. Although it could of course be included as a counter to Klein's criticism within the Friedman article, there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of Klein's views. Now I know that a lot of Friedmanite/Friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there """"laws"""" of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isn't likewise """"scientificic"""", and that presumably hold the same assumptions, but most people disagree.

Just to keep you happy, I'll discuss it briefly here. It has some very good points; for example Norberg convincingly shows there was a free-market trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond Klein's explanations (although the actual area of discussionof Klein's book were the far rarer, radical, fundamentalist reforms of the period, but more on that in a minute), he convincingly argues against Klein's account of events in Argentina and (mea culpa) China, his ridicule of Klein's """"Shock!Shock!Shock!"""" metaphor which I myself found unconvincing (as opposed to most her narrative and arguments) is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence, in many cases, of Friedman. But his 20-page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semi-accuracies, disingenuous argument and near-falsehoods as to make any suggestion that it """"proves"""" Klein wrong, or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments, completely ludicrous. I'll just list in no propersome of them since I don't have the time to do anything much else. 
He says she portrays the Chicago School as a place that brainwashed its students, as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion, whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. 
This one's just basic commone sense; he says Klein's Friedman crisis quote isn't from any important paper but a preface to Capitalism and Freedom; the preface to the guysmost important book, he defining manifesto, isn't significant? Tell that to Friedrich Engels. 
He says that Friedman gave the same advice to the Soviet Union, China and Yugoslavia, """"yet nobody would claim he was a communist"""", well Klein mentioned this herself, not claiming he was a communist, but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.
His suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the Chicago Boys didn't have control  until later on is simply false. While Pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along, while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will; Norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove Klein's accoun",0

 Welcome and thanks for wanting to improve this article. The current 34 are reliably sourced from the """"Official FIFA Soccer 10 Soundtrack,"""" an album released by EA on July 31st. Your 39 are from a press release dated July 27th which includes """"the complete in-game soundtrack for FIFA 10.""""
