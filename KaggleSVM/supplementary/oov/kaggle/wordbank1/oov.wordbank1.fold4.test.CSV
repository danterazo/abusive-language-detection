0,"808ikea>  I totally disagree with you, and not because I'm a Trump supporter, but because you are not being honest with yourself in denying the fact that he has accomplished quite a number of good things to date.  Go research for yourself and get some smarts at the same time.  Am I putting you down to make myself look better than you, of course not.  That again, proves your comment to be untrue at best.  Be honest instead of letting your emotions get the best of you.  Instead of being divisive try being a good American and support your POTUS.

0,"Hi Snarky, I don't find Civil to be very user friendly, so I don't Post so much anymore.  What most reminds me of Watergate is the way the investigation is unfolding, starting with the outer circle + working its way in. Nixon wasn't mentioned early in the WG investigation either. As the noose tightened for Nixon, you could see the administration drawing the """"wagons into a circle"""". I think the same is likely to happen to Trump.  As for evidence associated with the Uranium discussion? I'm not certain any laws were broken, are you? My understanding is it was more an ethical breach where it would be a conflict of interest for a sitting SOS to negotiate directly or indirectly such a deal with a foreign power. Trump has been guilty of conflicts of interest every day since he assumed office.  While I welcome transparency, Clinton's ethical violations pale in comparison to election meddling as committed by Nixon + the possible collusion of the Trump campaign with the Russians.

0,"Monetizing Net Operating Losses has been a bad idea from the start. Senator Dan Sullivan's involvement in helping to craft this legislation while he was in the Parnell administration will come back to haunt him in 2018. It interesting to hear all the testimony in State teleconferences from industry types saying we have to cut the budget more but we need to keep these cash payouts. Those companies not taking them may see future public relation benefits. Government funds being used like this challenges our perception of free enterprise. It makes one wonder if we should just go ahead and try a state owned facility like in a majority of world wide production.

Every time we see and hear the likes of Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters  mumble their impeachment nonsense whose combined IQ is somewhere south of  a box of rocks, the left's credibility goes down.

0,"You're attacking Rmiller because you can't attack the substance of the post, which is true.  In fact, Newfoundland and Labrador hasn't legitimately elected a Conservative federally since Harper tore up the Atlantic Accords so he could change the equalization formula.  We know who slit our throat.  An now westerners seem to have finally figured out that the equalization formula was weighed in favor of Ontario and Quebec, but you don't remember it was Harper's Conservative government that did it.  Or that Kenney and Jean were members of that government and voted for it.

0,"I'm certain you are right that there is a significant amount of anti-pipeline, anti-petroleum extraction/burning slant to the various media, playing to those prejudices held (with some justification) by a significant number of citizens. As I wrote earlier the original pipeline route was south of Standing Rock Reservation and would have crossed the Missouri River upstream of the water intakes for Bismarck/Fort Berthold. There was a big stink, and the pipeline operator decided the Indians wouldn't make a stink. They were wrong. Probably Trump can get the new route pushed through, but the Indians won't like it, even if they are indemnified against damages and paid a bribe. If that turns out to be a mutually beneficial solution, so be it; my point is that the Indians think they are getting doubly screwed, and they are right to think so.  In my opinion, some pipeline route carrying Bakken crude to refineries is economically important. Our economy still runs on petroleum.

0,"Not quite sure that is true TDW; your bias is coming through again.  """"The most important thing to remember in all of this is that the federal government pays for equalization, and it does it out of the same general revenue pool used to fund all of its programs and services. In other words, every Canadian that pays federal taxes contributes to equalization payments on the exact same basis. A rich person in Quebec or New Brunswick will contribute more to equalization than a less wealthy person in Alberta or Saskatchewan. And because there are more Ontarians paying federal taxes than Albertans, more dollars for equalization actually come from Ontario than Alberta.""""

The whole bootstraps-earn your own way narrative is not that simple, my friend, in an economy that's rigged for the corporate profits.
"
0,"This is the crux of the issue. It is a matter of supply and demand. The supply exists but the government can't afford to allow people to access it and therefore it is rationed. The reason they can't afford not to ration  healthcare is because it is 'free'.(If you give anything away 'for free', you will never be able to satisfy demand.) The ironic thing is that there is demand for the excess supply but it's not free and the government will not allow you to access healthcare that is not free. You can't access what is 'free' nor can you pay for it even though it is abundant at a price.

"
0,"While don't get me wrong here, if Russia did actually hack US political organizations, as what is being claimed, it's not right. But this is nothing more then a distraction, to distract from what is obvious corruption within the DNC. It's as if they are justifying the actions the DNC were making because they got caught. That the information regardless of it was a hack or an insider leak, is somehow forgiven because they were caught by illicit means. The corrupt DNC, rigged the system against Sanders, they also broke campaign laws and incited violence, correction... Paid protestors to go insite violence at their opponets rallies. This was not only proven from the email leaks, but also the undercover journalist, who's work is being glossed over by the mainstream media. If your going to be tough on a foreign government for possibly interfering in our election, then you should be equally tough on the corruption in your own house.

So what are to believe that our credit rating is more important than out fiscal stability? Credit, as we all well know, is the worst thing we can use or care about. Until we can cut out the unneeded costs and operate on what we take in for revenue then we shouldn't be asking for credit anywhere. The governor and now the legislature has taxed us again this year another 1200.00 that is a total 1.5 billion dollars the state has taken from every Man, Women, And Child regardless of their income. They have taxed small children under working age 1200.00 each. This is nothing more than a money grab and is the one main reason our economy has turned into a recession.

The current budget of DND is easily enough to pay for the tiny forces we need to get access to NATO and other US run organizations.

Worth a short viewing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOZ0irgLwxU  The hysteria now being displayed by journalists in the MSM is due to the fact that their monopoly and control of the news - what they dish out to the man in the street - has been broken by the Internet.

NCR should hire a political analyst to do politics and let MSW concentrate on the intersection of Catholicism and political culture. Global Sisters should be reincorporated into the main site. Personally I don't make it over there because I get bogged down in the features on the NCR home page.  I do appreciate identity politics when it's well done. (Jamie Manson is excellent.) The church's sexism and homophobia is a persistent source of alienation for young people, and NCR should could continue to hammer away at these issues.

0,"Notice the big sell is for the lower business taxes and elimination of death taxes.  By the way, with the current death taxes, you have to be stinking rich before you have to pay anything, and there are legal loopholes they can use to get around much of the rest.  In other words, the big sell is to give more money to the 'job creators' by reducing taxes.  Reality is this does not help.  The increase in the standard deduction is something most voters can understand and provides the political support for the rest of the package.  Most voters do not understand how business taxes work, it only taxes profits and employee and other expenses, including re-investment do not get taxed.  Reality is, if you give a rich person (generally one who likes to acquire wealth) more money, they simply say 'Thank you.'  Sure they might invest in property or stocks or money markets, but these games generally do not put this money back to work in the economy.

0,"An extradition treaty with China is premature for all the reasons cited by Elcock and Morten - but there is one more. China has shown a penchant for exerting influence over its emigres wherever in the world they might alight. Strong cultural ties are expected but there's an unwritten code by which its diaspora are duty bound to serve the greater interests of the homeland - even at the expense of their newfound hosts. A patchwork of extradition treaties across the globe might convince holdouts they aren't beyond Beijing's reach. From afar, it can be difficult to distinguish legitimate allegations of wrongdoing in this closed, autocratic society from something more iniquitous.  We can't allow China's aspirations for extraterritorial reach to hang over ethnic Chinese residents or citizens of Canada like the Sword of Damocles. Until its justice system and civil rights protections catch up with China's burgeoning economic prowess, there are satisfactory alternatives to extradition.

No matter how comfortable people are around bears, bears can be unpredictable and when one misjudges that and is not prepared for that they put their lives in danger in any bear encounter. Treadwell's 10 year summer living with the Coastal Brown Bears shows as one wildlife biologist stated just how these bears are really tolerant of humans. I know from spending time in Katmai as far back as the 1970's that our discussions on bear behavior was that when the bears were eating salmon that is what they are engaged in 100% since most bears are loners unless they have cubs, so they are into their annual socializing at the salmon streams. But finding a lone brownie or a mother with cubs is a different story and they are more protective and are more wary of humans. I do know from 10 years on Kodiak Island that sharing any area with a large population of bears a lot just increases the odds that you will have a direct encounter with a bear, you think? So be prepared.

0,"Try this.  Fold in all electricity charges into one single charge, the per kw/h fee.  And the per kw/h feel would reflect the true cost of delivering a kw of electricity to the user based on their geographic location and other relevant factors.  No destination charge, recovery fee's, subsidies or anything.  This will achieve two things: 1) when people reduce usage, they will actually save money; 2) this will end the subsidy of various interest groups (businesses, rural etc.) through the delivery charge etc.  This way, people would pay the true cost of electricity delivery to their home or choose alternative means of delivery.  People who live in urban areas would immediately see a reduction in their bills due to the end of subsidies.  And when you reduced usage, it would be perfectly reflected on your bill.

So Stevens and the public never got the resolution that both deserved. Particularly the public.  This set the course for the Obama Justice Department, which failed to prosecute the bankers who took down the economy in the Great Recession, throwing millions out of their homes and jobs.

Khadr, when objectively looking at his situation, was not given the same choice. His family (mother and father) forced that on him... We don't seem to have an issue with this concept in Africa when these are conflicts we are not directly involved in. The minute we are confronted with this we change the rules.

0,"I would argue that as a bicyclist and the owner of two vehicles and a 5th wheel, I am actually paying more than my fair share.  I pay taxes on both vehicles as well as the 5th wheel, but drive them less than the average person (by far).  Between our two vehicles we average about 10,000 miles per year.  I cycle to work and for recreation, and this keeps my large, heavy truck off the road yet I still pay just as much in registration fees as if I drove it the average of 12-15,000 miles per year that most people do.  I am not opposed to the proposed tax on bikes as long as it is a fair tax and goes towards its stated purpose.  Most bicyclists are also car owners, so we pay for the roads the same as everyone else.

0,"The answer will vary according to who you ask.  Per the Baha'i I've spoken with, they were all innocent victims who didn't take sides.  According to the (greater number) of participants in the Islamic Revolution I've spoken with, Bah'ai were indeed complicit in the Shah's atrocities.  But, as in most situations involving conflict, the truth probably lies somewhere between.  Having said that, it's a fact Baha'i served with Savak, the Shah's secret police death squads.  But then so did many nominal 'Shi'a'.  I recall being embraced and kissed on both sides of my neck by an Iranian at an 'Eid gathering several years ago.  A little later I was informed by his wife, a devout Iraqi Shi'a who had married him while being unaware of his past, that he was a high-ranking Savak officer who had fled the Revolution to avoid answering for his crimes.  She was quite miserable about it.  Upon learning that I felt like I needed a shower.  (CONTINUED BELOW...)

Gore challenged an incredibly close vote in a critical state, and if Trump intends merely to assert his right to do the same thing if the same situation arises, no one would have a problem with that.  Ultimately, Gore accepted a court decision with which he did not agree; he respected the rule of law.  Trump has once again today expressed his utter contempt for the people and the Constitution of the United States: he solemnly asserted that he will accept the outcome of the election (dramatic pause) -- if he wins.  Trump is the puppet not of Putin, or at least not just of Putin, but of Steve Bannon, the white supremacist and anti-Semite who is the CEO of his campaign. They are laying the groundwork for the neo-fascist media effort they will launch when this awful campaign is finally ended. Deplorable? Despicable.

Most people will give Trudeau some credit for using an embarrassing anecdote from his own family to illustrate the inherent unfairness of the system.

They are taxed as a private entity as would an individual. Corporations do have Constitutional rights (especially the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th and 9th Amendments and the Commerce Clause). Other than taxes (which are more onerous for corporations), corporations operate under the same rules as partnerships or individuals. So to claim corporations do not have rights is dangerously selective application of law. To claim that corporations should not have the right to make political contributions opens the door to demanding the same of labor unions, PACS and similar issue oriented groups.

0,"There isn't much to investigate, really. There is very strong public evidence that Russia is responsible for the DNC and Podesta email hacks, and US intelligence agencies (who have access to far more information than is public) have essentially confirmed it. Russia gave the email dumps to Wikileaks, who trickled out the not-particularly-scandalous emails over the course of the campaign with the goal of keeping up a steady flow of negative headlines for Clinton.  As many have pointed out, there is nothing remarkable about the hacks themselves, which are commonplace, and the US is not above doing the same thing. The escalation here is that Russia released the compromised documents with the goal of influencing a US election. Most agencies reserve their intelligence for use for national security purposes -- election tampering is a significantly more hostile act.  This isn't 'election fixing', but it is still a big deal.

0,"Ah yes the only answer to the vote has to be they did not know what they were voting for.  If that is truely the case then the stay camp did a very very very poor job.  It was their job to promote and educate the voters on the reasons to stay in the EU.  What are the advantages?   I think the Brits knew exactly what they have in the EU and do not like the direction it is taking them.  The costs were higher than the benefits to them it would seem.

0,"If you truly had no intention of discussing politics, we wouldn't be having this dialogue. Since I feel the two issues are related, my opinion addresses both. The proposed ordinance would result in government interference with privately owned lots, AND it is being proposed (once again) by a representative from the party that is almost always in favor of more government regulation, oversight, and taxation. Both issues are related.

"
0,"Newsreader60 below is correct in one respect. The article posing the proposition of the traditionalists: """"Secular - bad; sacred - good"""" is misleading. The error, the """"mis-lead"""" is to elevate ideological to sacred'ness, to identify cult with church.  OUR sacred, our specific articulation of God is fundamentally rooted in the secular: Incarnation.  As if to ensure that we limited humans were sufficiently armed to defend ourselves from hierarchical elitism, God went further: """"God so loved the world...."""". The death,  entombment and resurrection are fundamentally secular as is/are the """"render unto Caesar"""", on and on. We are called to permeate - as Jesus in us, as God in creation  - the secular.  To retreat, to castigate, to exclude the secular in embracing a formulaic creed that reinforces exclusion, builds walls from the real of intelligent perception and evolving consciousness of the real is the ultimate of ideology; it  is inhuman, cult, un-Christ, even to the point of being """"anti-"""".

0,"Pedophiles coming out of prison are still pedophiles.  They can have their freedom after serving their time but they should wear a tracking device that can be monitored.  Pedophiles are not honest people like the rest of us and they are clever and devious.  For their own protection, it's better to impose some confinement and tracking because they don't self-regulate in this matter.
"
0,"Boomer 88,  That just goes to prove that prohibition never prevented anybody from consuming marijuana that wants to.  Contrary to what prohibitionists are so desperately trying to get the public to believe wholeheartedly and without question, legalizing marijuana IS NOT adding anything new into our society that wasn't always there and widely available already.  Marijuana has been ingrained within our society and part of human culture since biblical times, for thousands of years.  So, since marijuana has always been with us and humans already have thousands upon thousands of years worth of experience with marijuana, what great calamities and """"Doomsday Scenarios"""" do prohibitionists really think will happen now due to current legalization efforts that have never ever happened before in all human history?  Legalize Nationwide!

As you put your DU pillow between your legs tonight and grind yourself to sleep, just remember that there is a National Hockey League team in Denver that warrants good journalism.

0,"I don't find the former communications director of Stephen Harper to be a credible commentator. Harper built his entire political strategy around dividing Canadians by ethnicity, religion, region, education and economic/social class in an effort to carve out just enough extremists to hold on to power. He was one of the most divisive and destructive PMs in Canadian history. At least Trudeau is trying to unify the country. His celebrity gives Canada an international profile that it rarely has. Hopefully, Canadians' """"tall poppy syndrome"""" does not kick in.
"
0,"Mr. Trudeau is a global celebrity and a UN star who brings rainbows and sunshine to his adoring international audience of global elitists.  Why would such an international star be knowledgeable about """"Wynn's Law"""" when he can instead be wined and dined on private islands by wealthy figureheads such as the Aga Khan.

"
0,"Trudeau's approval rating is higher now than at the election, and polls show that a significant number of both Conservatives (generally of the homeless PC variety) and NDPs consider him the best choice for PM. The Liberal government's """"massively high immigration rate"""" is a target of 300,000 in 2017, the same as 2016. Under Harper, the totals were as high as 280,000 (2010), and usually in the 250,000 range. I guess the Conservatives' aggressive courting of the immigrant vote stopped working once all those new Canadians realized that their family and friends were being systematically barred from visiting if they needed a visa, and their overseas spouses and children were waiting years and years to be granted permanent residency, if they were lucky enough ever to be approved.
"
1,"Neither you or the Church present a whiff of compelling evidence that homosexuality is """"disordered"""", and equating one's sexual orientation with murder, selfishness, greed and brutality is libelous at best, and hateful at worst. Until the Church can present an intelligent argument regarding homosexuality -- and sexuality in general -- the Church's teaching is without merit.

0,"Just have to enjoy the negative comments here. Those who've already decided that this process is a failure. No proof or facts on that, of course. But since the liberals did it, it must be wrong. Suuure.  Keep it up. The more negative you are about this , and about the other changes in present-day Canada, the longer it will take anyone to take over the government from the liberals. The CPC can't even form an effective opposition, leave alone government. How long to pick a leader? Wow.  The changes to the senator approval process are positive. Learn to live with it.

"
0,"How can anyone buy properties above their true value?  Properties have no intrinsic value.  They are worth exactly what someone will pay for them.  The value of a property is what someone just paid for it.  If it did not sell recently, it is what similar properties similarly situated just sold for.  MPAC just tries -- not very eptly, but that is another story -- to price properties relative to what similar properties are selling for.  I don't think any of the people complaining about their assessment would want to sell their properties for any less than what the owners of similar properties got.  Property tax being based on property values, you can't get full market value for your property unless you are also willing to pay full tax. .

0,"Did he assign fault ? I did not see that. This discussion seems to be void of practical wisdom from many engaging in it. We all know, right or wrong, that women who dress in certain ways are going to attract more attention, right or wrong, that is the way it is.  A woman who wants to avoid UNWANTED attention could dress differently if she chose to, to avoid unwanted it. Attention can be a good thing or a bad thing, some women use attention in business to gain an upper hand, much the same way a person uses a """"power tie"""". Any of us who are married probably have wives who do NOT want attention and probably dress in a way as to discourage it.  You said you take pics of naked women - Which are obviously meant for someone to look at , and those pictures are going to illicit certain responses from different people. Some will react a certain way, some will react another way, but you cannot deny those reactions would be different had they taken pictures with clothes on.

She took the indefensible step of preventing the BCUC from overseeing Site C hearings. Why would she do that? Primarily because she wanted to prevent the BCUC from saying no again as they had twice done in the past.  Further, Chairperson Harry Swain told us that he was prevented from considering any other form of energy generation. Geothermal is one that is successfully used all over the world. Benefits? Much smaller footprint, ready in a fraction of time and for a fraction of the cost of a mega dam.
"
0,"The very headline shows that this is not a newspaper reporting the news, which is becoming a big problem for those who wish to be informed, perish the thought. What it might as well read applies more aptly to the party in power, which has far fewer qualified politicians, as amongst the Conservative candidates there are several with extensive ministerial qualifications, not to mention serious academic backgrounds and/or business experience, which is not to be found if one decides to have cabinets and courts made up of equal numbers based on sex. Here is the more apt headline: """"After """"lock her up"""": Are there any real leaders among Liberals?  And we can start with the P.M. whose qualifications are surpassed by at least half of the Conservative candidates for leader of the party.
"
0,"I agree the church needs a new morality which needs to be based on solid foundations.  To give an example.  Two hundred years ago the world population was approximately 1 Billion.  At that time Malthus warned us prophetically and provided us with an explanation of exponential population growth (2 x 2= 4, 4 x4 = 16; 16 x 16 = 256; 256 x 256 =   etc. ) and warned us of the prophecy in Rev. of the 4 horses of the Apocalypse.  In 1930 the world population had doubled.  In the 1970s the world population had tripled.   At that time an ecologist--Garrett Hardin again warned us of the CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE EARTH and that we were nearing the tipping point at which the population growth would no longer be sustainable.  The world population is now over 7 Billion--and increase of over 5 Billion in 80 years.  He provided us with a PARABLE FROM NATURE--the Parable of St. Matthew Island.  One symptom of overpopulation is environmental degradation...no more words left here except..birth control.

As the cockroaches are shaken out of the American system, they come scurrying to Canada who we embrace as brothers.

Lack of interest in politics? Couldn't take time off work?  No local elections that mattered to them?  Belief that their vote wouldn't affect the outcome? (Hillary was predicted to win by all the polls except one and even the bookies in England lost money on this one!)  Usually fewer vote in the off Presidential elections.  What does that portend for the Senate and House races in two years?
"
0,"Wally,  I would like to correct you for posterity.  The Freedom Foundation came up with the idea and sent it to ALEC so they would share it around the country.  You are free to argue the motives of those who promote the policy, but it is undeniably a benefit to union members.  When Lincoln County held its first open meeting, the members being represented were very interested in attending, in fact, they were the only people in attendance.  Far too often union members are part of locals that represent several types of workers. When the bargaining unit consists of 60% of one type of worker, 30% of another and only 10% of the last, the 10% frequently wonder if they are represented at all.  I recently spoke with someone who was part of a 48% to 52% breakout. After negotiations, the president of the company was retiring and spoke with members of the 48%. When asked about their grievances, the president told them none of the issues were ever brought up.

0,"Nice try at deflecting Jeff. Unless you're American you might want to ask yourself the questions you addressed to me. And if you are American ask yourself why you're bothering to post on a Canadian newspaper's website.  I care only in as much as I hope that the leader of our closest neighbour and largest trading partner conducts himself in an honest, responsible, and adult manner; that he acts in a way that reflects the seriousness of the office he occupies and that he fully grasps the implications and repercussions of his actions nationally, regionally, and globally. As such what he does and says does affect the world I live in even if not me directly.  If Germany fit the same relationship situation with Canada then I'd be concerned about Merkel's actions as well however the evidence is clear that she conducts herself as a leader in a way far more befitting her position and in a more mature and responsible way than Trump has demonstrated to date.

The fact that you are so entirely unconcerned for the feeling of your co-workers, and that you consider their feelings, not only a waste of time, but literally offensive to you, kind of tells us all we need to know, doesn't it?

0,"My wife and I saw the movie """"Bridge of Spies"""" in a movie theater and we saw it again recently on TV. The central character is an attorney who was able to persuade a judge that convicted Russian spy Col. Rudolph Abel should be spared the death penalty as having him alive might prove useful. Several years later, this same attorney was used by the federal government to arrange a swap between the USA and USSR of Abel for captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers. At the last minute, East German police arrested and held an American tourist. East Germany wanted to play with the big boys and didn't like being used by the USSR. Fortunately, sane adults prevailed in the end, the original swap went forward as planned, and the American tourist was also released. North Korea wants to be seen as one of the big boys. Continually taunting North Korean leaders does not help. Escalating the rhetoric does not help. Trump needs to stop escalating the bombast and finally start acting like an adult.

I do not think Trump and Congress are up to the challenge. They are rather lazy and they live a pampered life. Both political parties are rather incompetent. Politically, if five million Puerto Ricans move to Georgia and other Southern states, it could turn them from solidly Republican to toss up states.

Here are a few more that are relevant.  $10 billion worth of oil and gas liquids is taken from Alaska per year, tax free, and the Senate this year decided to pay almost $700 million in corporate welfare for Big Oil to take the $10 billion dollars worth of oil.  All of the above is a flagrant violation of Art. VIII of the Alaska Constitution.  It will result in the destruction of the Alaska economy.  No resident will NOT be hurt by the actions of the Senate.  All residential and commercial real estate will lose value as jobs are lost and the population flees Alaska.

Such comments are 'too general' for a Canadian police force to lay charges in Canada's  accommodating political climate. Such thoughts, even when stated, are not a crime -- though a hate crime can be a statement. Should he have been monitored? How many police officers would it take to  monitor all harmful or hateful thoughts?  People come from regions of the world where, for centuries, competing theocracies ensured citizens were imbued with strict beliefs.Look at hostilities in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Somalia -- and Ireland's past. Instead of trying to accommodate ALL beliefs here, it is time to deal with their long-term harm. Canadian politicians should not support such divisions in modern society.

1,"Ah, insults and nonsense. Standard fare for Trump supporters.  The case against Trump is more than not liking him. The problems with this President are, in no particular order:  1) Utter incompetence. 2) Complete disdain for our governmental institutions. 3) Contempt for the restrictions on the Presidency, most obviously the Emoluments clause of the Constitution, as well as the developing obstruction of justice charges.  The man is a liar , crooked to the core, incompetent, and possibly insane or mentally incompetent. You are right that none of what I list in this sentence is enough to have him impeached - but 3) above will suffice. It takes time for the wheels of justice to grind, but grind they will, and Trump is already up to his arm in them. The rest will follow.

But it was when Dr Zweli Mkhize, """"who boasts a track record of excellence as both a seasoned political leader and a clean and efficient administrator"""" was suddenly presented as the ANC's deus ex machina that the whole piece for me was just reduced to promotion of a favoured candidate.  So see this piece for what it is: a half-nod to problems which are not really the ANC's doing, all in building up to the once more proferred solution of self-correction but this time undertaken with Mhikze at the helm.

Would you have it that when 51% of the population is of the view that religion is superstition, corrupting the minds of young children, that that majority moral conviction ought to be imposed on Christians in the form a law making it illegal to teach religion to children, including participation in religious services, or hearing the bible read aloud.  Thank about it. That is exactly what you invite unless you accept that IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY, the law must not be used to impose the moral beliefs of some on all.  As for rape and robbery, there is virtual universal acceptance that these actions must be illegal because no one wants to be robbed or raped. Get the difference?

0,"Of course it is draconian.  The republicans have never intended to replace the ACA because they don't believe that every American actually should have regular health care.  They are perfectly fine with rationing health care based on the job you were able to obtain or whether you were rich enough to buy it on your own.  No one has challenged them on why they believe this type of rationing is acceptable?  They should be made to finally explain it.  I think there are better ways to ration health care.  Other countries have shown several examples to choose from in fact.  For sure we should be having discussion on what should and shouldn't be treated.   Or under what circumstances.

0,"What may be proposed today for an income tax will not remain the same. Here is some history of the federal income tax. Congress passed an amendment in 1913 implementing the income tax promising that it will never rise above 7%. A progressive income tax structure, the 2nd plank of the Communist Manifesto, is imposed on the American people in 1918. The top rate is raised to 94% for every dollar earned over $200,000 in 1944. On principal, I strongly oppose an income tax of any kind. I would support a flat sales tax. I would support it, after the budget is further cut across the board closer to the fundamental purpose of government, which is to protect people from other people. Our Founding Fathers did not support a direct tax on people because it was detrimental to the liberty of a free people. They favored tariffs, which is a consumption tax. A sales tax is a consumption tax. It would mean everyone would be paying the bills of state, not just those who work.

0,"An impetus toward collegiality was embedded in the Second Vatican Council. It was the great work of the post-Concil years to work out practical mechanisms for the collegial expression of authority in the church. Various expressions of collegiality emerged: Synods, Councils (National, Diocesan, Parish), and Conferences. The work, though well begun, was not complete, nor would it ever be complete. However, Pope John Paul II intervened to strip or weaken the authority of every collegial body that emerged after the Council. When the US Bishops were working on their pastoral letter, “The Challenge of Peace”, John Paul did not object to their teaching -- he was to their left; he objected to their method: they were (gasp!) listening to experts and ordinary people from a variety of walks of life; not all of them clerics; not all of them even Catholics. And they were doing it publicly!  Francis is reasserting the Council’s collegial vision. Long live Pope Francis!

0,"This is a huge mistake by the media as the woman could be ill. Second, it's crucial for patients to be able to choose.  If she is well, a racist rant is clearly wrong but she is nevertheless entitled to choose a doctor she feels comfortable with - and this includes, everything from gender, religion, culture, outlook. I have never thought about race being an aspect, but if that is her comfort level, she has a right to make the choice. We don't know what her thinking is. It may be based on some past experience or not. Mentally ill patients often express racism and other similar fears, and must not be persecuted for it.  For example, many women choose female doctors as that is their comfort level. Many patients would reject religious adherents for fear of certain values. It's their right.  Putting an irate loud, clearly stressed, patient online or in the media for this is clearly wrong, on so many fronts.

Maybe spending R30 billion over 10 years bailing out an airline and thereby subsidising the middle class (and the looters)  could have been spent building 300 000 RDP houses uplifting say 1.2 million poor. If routes need to be maintained for political purposes (eg to Beijing, our Chinese paymasters), simply sell the airline with those conditions. If the name SAA carries SA's name abroad, sell it with the condition the name is kept. All simple solution's to the ANC's """"objections"""". Of course, as with most of the chaos the ANC leaves behind it, how would you sell a company that year after year makes losses of billions.

0,"My Life with the Saints is one of my favorite books and helped me through a spiritual crisis when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.  I read that book so many times it was falling apart.  Fr. Martin personifies Catholicism and being a good priest and Jesuit in ways that the conservative types like Ruse don't.  Martin's vision of Catholicism is attractive and welcoming while Ruse, Rorate Caeli, Fr. Z, etc. is hateful and mean-spirited.  I'm not sure what the latter think they are doing; they are horrible ambassadors for the Catholic faith.  Lapsed Catholics, non-Catholics, even practicing Catholics are uniformly repulsed by their bullying and hate.  (Unless that is the point and they are trying to drive people out of the Church.)

0,"Canada's emissions are irrelevant but Trudeau's policies have real impacts in terms of lower productivity, lower investment, and lower quality of life. If global leaders were serious about climate change, they would immediately impose restrictions on air travel/transport. Secondly, Canada's immigration targets would be cut in half as population growth is not """"sustainable"""" but the world is moving towards over 9 billion people by 2050. Don't take my word for it, look for yourself. Real sustainability is not politically correct (birth control in Africa and the middle east), it involves policies that restrict individual freedoms and conflict with strongly held religious and cultural beliefs. Trudeau is really just taxing Canadians to pay for social programs under the guise of environmental stewardship - Canada's hashtag climate policies are purely symbolic but the economic impacts are very real.

Public Universities have failed to keep up with the technological revolution wherein lecture type presentations can be recorded once, by the best professor in the country, and be made available to all students whenever they want and as many times as they want.  The entire structure of traditional higher education is becoming obsolete.  The schools are not leading the charge to the new educational structure that our technology now allows.  As such, support of the ever more obsolete institutions will tend to erode in anticipation of new educational paradigms.

Disclosure of sexual abuse to a counsellor is not an “extrajudicial denunciation” under Secreta Continere because a counsellor is not a priest’s superior. I would be very surprised if some form of reporting was not occurring in those places given the widespread condemnation of bishops for covering up. But even if such reporting is taking place, I cannot see how Pope Francis’ promise to rid the Church of clericalism and secrecy over child sexual abuse can be taken seriously when that culture is embodied in canon law through the pontifical secret. Lay people are not protected from being reported to the police, only clergy.

The succession of changes through each climate cycle and termination was similar, and atmospheric and climate properties oscillated between stable bounds. Interglacial periods differed in temporal evolution and duration. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane correlate well with Antarctic air-temperature throughout the record. Present-day atmospheric burdens of these two important greenhouse gases seem to have been unprecedented during the past 420,000 years.

Bottom line: Mr Furlong has been scrutinized by the courts and dragged through the mud by the media, and has since been exonerated.

If the facts reflect badly on Trump and his enablers, which they do, that isn't Paul Krugman's fault, that is simply the facts, no matter how many Trump supporters call them, essentially, lies. When lies are necessary to hide Trump's awful blunders and rob the people of their affordable health care, that is Trump's fault for lying, Paul Ryan's fault for lying, Mike Pence's fault for lying. It is not Paul Krugman's fault for telling the factual truth. This is the truth: Trump is a liar and an abomination. Do you insist on new facts? Maybe, facts that make Trump look good? Those facts don't exist.

0,"Wrong, of course some people got insurance but no where near the numbers promised and 84 % of those were simply gifted into an already overburdened medicaid. And while they have the card new studies show the uninsured have better outcomes than those on medicaid as doctor flee from the regulations and stop accepting patients. While this was happening millions lost their coverage as insurers dropped out of markets and those seeking employment found only part time jobs that allowed employers to avoid providing costly insurance. More lost coverage when small business were forced out of business or had to downsize. The next time government publishes honest number will be the first time, they have proven themselves unreliable. All this is really a distraction from the fact that the end game for democrat's is a socialist 1 payer system which the majority do not want. As we've already seen socialist programs cost more, provide less and take away free choice. It's also unconstitutional .

The study also found, after adjusting for demographic factors like age, gender and race, as well as alcohol use, marijuana users were not at a greater risk to crash than sober drivers.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted the study in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It compared more than 3,095 drivers in the area who were involved in crashes, and twice as many controls (6,190) who were not.  The findings diverge from several studies on marijuana and driving, but the NHTSA believes this new study is the most comprehensive.  “We believe this to be the largest, the most closely controlled study of its kind that’s been conducted in the United States,” said Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesman for NHTSA.

0,"Scott, I met a man who had been divorced when he was still a teenager, or early 20's. He took all the blame for what happened. He married again and has been with his wife for over forty years. He couldn't get annulment and married civilly. I did their marriage forty years on. That guy went to Mass every week in those forty years and never took communion. Obviously, he can now.  A forty year sentence for being a stupid young man. He described to me how he felt over all those years. The Eucharist wasn't exactly the core of his being as a teenager. But it's importance grew on him as he faced life's joys and sadnesses. Parents funerals, family weddings, big parish celebrations - no Eucharist. And a big, red arrow pointing at him in the congregation.  No person who actually believes in the Eucharist would be capable of banning another person from receiving it. Burke and his friends really don't believe in Jesus. The difference between him and Trump is that Trump is honest about himself.

My sister-in-laws Italian father was horrified that my dad helped out in the kitchen, especially clean up, but my dad just simply said that many hands made for light work as well as fun in the kitchen.  Most men I know help out, but maybe it's a family culture thing since I certainly worked with women who griped about doing it all.

You may still be ahead of the game but in many cases now people have good incomes on retirement and the withdrawal of the rrsp throws them into a higher tax bracket.    Happened to me and many I know. The advice on the dividend growth is a good one and especially if you use a drip system.  Using the TFSA for this is a wonderful vehicle. Also a portion in GIC while not great will provide stability and security.  Another point of advice is not to get into the habit of checking the daily sheet on your investment as the usual volatility will probably result in twitchy fingers and sleepless nights.

0,"Hugh's analysis ignores a very important point.  The fringe aside, Britain is essentially a two-party system like the United States.  In Canada, first past the post oftern results in a majority government with just over a third of popular vote because we have 3 major parties.  Riding distribution further skews the results.  Should we move to proportional representation?  Maybe.  The only drawback to democracy is that it is slow.  A proportional scheme would encourage fringe politics, meaning longer debate and even slower parliamentary process.  As to the British election, I think it was a rejection of May's hubris coupled with the late realization that Brexit may not be the best course of action after all.  The attacks in London didn't help either.  It was more a rejection of May than an endorsement of Corbyn.

0,"-The fact that the USCCB has voted to make permanent their previously ad hoc Committee on Religious Liberty is nothing more than solidifying an attitude of “Religious freedom for me but not for thee.”   A most obvious example:  their concern all along has been more about limiting access to contraception than about who foots the bill. That suspicion was confirmed when the bishops turned from arguing for an exemption from the contraception mandate to arguing for the repeal of the mandate itself, claiming that it’s a violation of religious liberty. Under the First Amendment, religious believers have often been granted exemptions from general laws, such as laws requiring service in the military, or school attendance, or children’s vaccinations.  But the logic of accommodation on religious grounds has never meant that the law in question—requiring military service, say, or vaccinations—is itself a violation of religious liberty and must be repealed.

0,"You have such a short memory Mr. 55. Before the ACA health insurance premiums were going up 25%/year. Now they are going up but much slower and the insurance you have is a real package that you can use when you get the Big C or some other extremely expensive malady. Before the ACA insurance companies could legally take away your plan if you required intensively expensive healthcare, the payout was limited on a yearly and lifetime basis and medical expenses were the number one cause of bankruptcies in America. The ACA has made the situation better but as with the advent and revisions of Social Security it is only the beginning.

The picture of Comey that comes out of the FBI material is of an overzealous investigator who really wanted to prosecute Hillary and probably disliked her.

I believe better decisions (more nuanced, and sounder both now and into the future economically and democratically) are made when a greater diversity of views is represented and boiled down.

0,"I appreciate the feedback.  I asked for thoughts and you obliged.  Note this differs from taxation in that the money never goes through government, so the payment process is privatized and builds on existing profit distribution mechanisms so is less costly than  government wealth redistribution.  I agree with your observation that if imposed in one jurisdiction, that might discourage investment in that jurisdiction, which is why it would have to be implemented by treaty across most meaning jurisdictions (no room left to say that in my first post).  If priced at the right level, this would not eliminate incentive any more than direct taxation.  The latter could be lowered, and increased distribution efficiency might realize savings.  Does that address the valid concerns you raised?  Note I am trying to harvest some collective wisdom from the readership  to come up with creative solutions for the future we may be facing.  That seems more useful than the usual dumping on each other.

Drumpf lied cruelly to them about how he plans to do that.  He can’t bring back the coal miners jobs.  Obama didn’t kill those.  They were killed by LNG and by the declining price of wind and solar energy.  Drumpf cannot bring back the manufacturing jobs.

Wyoming and Alaska have the highest premiums in the nation but both could have joined in with the other Northwest states at the inception of the ACA so that we would be in much larger pools but out governor chose to spend the money and time instead on suing the Obama administration over the very Constitutionality of the law.

So why was the left out looking for a fight based on antagonistic taunts of alt-righters? ...who, I understand, had obtained a permit to hold a demonstration?  Had this all gone without issue, then the alt-right would have gotten very little media attention, and soon Lee's statue would have been removed.  However, the left, itching for a fight, just provided this group with hours of free press.  Bravo!!  As Trump said, it's time for ALL sides to step back and take a big time-out... cooler heads need to prevail before there can be any attempt at reconciliation on what appears to be some grievous differences in this part of the USA.

Mr. Trump is saying """"enough is enough"""" - let's address American problems first. Let's cut the flow of American dollars to the rest of the world.  Unfortunately, the Liberal Party of Canada led by Gerry Butts (aka Justin Trudeau) doesn't understand that """"charity begins at home"""" and that we should be addressing our own problems rather than fostering Trudeau's worldly image.

0,"My wife retired as a full-time nursing professor a couple of years ago and her position is now being staffed by several part-timers. The colleges need experienced full-time staff for the majority of the program delivery and continuity to ensure quality. The reality is that instead these colleges have loaded up management administrators at the expense of front-line teaching staff. The number of these managers has nearly DOUBLED over the past 16 years while the number of faculty members has decreased relative to the number of students in the same period.  I estimate that the college system could save approximately $200 million annually just by going back to the 2001 ratio of managers to students. What other organizations have doubled their management staff ratio? It's ridiculous.

0,"Yeah, ignore the fact that government regulators have restricted the supply of both medical providers and medical facilities, thereby driving up the cost of both. They've also insisted upon keeping the state-based silos of insurance, thereby maintaining a government-created virtual monopoly in most states. I'm not saying that insurance isn't part of the problem. I'm saying focusing on insurance does far too little to address the REAL problem, which is government interference in the medical care market. You've got to eliminate that before you can fix the problem. Unfortunately, that's not what we're doing, so the problem will morph rather than reduce. The private markets are distorted because of government interference (and probably because of their own cronyism with government), but the solution is less government, not more. You don't put out a fire by dumping gasoline on it and you don't fix a problem caused by government-created monopolization by instituting more government control.

That bears repeating: The only relevant question is whether consent was given.. The accuser says she doesn't know. No matter how much you might like to think so you do not know whether a crime has been committed. The only one who dies is the cabbie.

Conservative policy is too individualized and narcissistic, when we all know a team is better than a group of individuals. But then we get too close to the dreaded socialism.

They are institutionalised ; remote from marital relations; having lived out their lives in an all male institution; that would appear to have a very significant number of male active and passive relationships. Reports out of Rome also indicate that Vatican assigned clerics, enjoy a very active social life in the bars; bathhouses & clubs of the ancient city.

At trial Owens had 3 public defender lawyers, the prosecution had 4 lawyers plus a full time Aurora detective. Yes, the names of those on Owens trial team changed from time to time as public servants often leave or move on to different jobs.  But at no time did Owens have more than 3 trial lawyers.  During the post-conviction phase the prosecution used no less than 8 different lawyers but more accurately they never had more than 3 attorneys, 1 attorney general, 1 full time detective and a full time paralegal at any single time. Owens capital post conviction team never had more than 4 attorneys.  But again from time to time the names changed due to conflicts of interest and in two instances lawyers passed away.

Remember, a shipping container is just a steel box, not the high end finished product you see on facebook.  The roofs of shipping containers also can't carry the snow load required in most of Canada, so they still need a roof.  Steel conducts and radiates and absorbs heat in a majorly brutal way, making them far inferior to a wood framed structure.  Cutting and fastening steel is FAR more difficult and dangerous than cutting and fastening wood.  The problem with tiny homes is where to put them?  Same problem we all have that's causing this housing crisis.  Sure, Canada is huge but obviously nobody goes and lives in the tundra or on a glacier or in the muskeg or in a wheat field.

And executive orders are an abuse of power when that black guy did it but when Trump does it he's just doing what he promised.  In other words, Plumber, its OK if you're a republican but not if you're a Democrat.

Just like great communist before him he pits the working class against the rich. Standard fair for communist wannabees.  In 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published the Communist Manifesto, which called on workers of the world, or the proletariat (JUSTIN'S SO CALLED MIDDLE CLASS), to unite against the bourgeoisie (HIS SO CALLED ONE PERCENTS) , the rich and powerful at the expense of the workers. Marx understood that communism could arise in countries with these two classes present if polarised properly. Justin and Butt's are using the same strategy to cloud the their real agenda.

Wherever socialist countries exist, free speech rights and dissent aren't tolerated. For many who do wish to exercise what we value as Americans results in imprisonment or demise for their opposition to socialist ideology. There really is no individual liberty and freedom, as those rights are eroded.

Muller, while grudgingly conceding that green burials (in the forest) might be OK, he then insisted there must be a marker on the base of the tree. Why?  Billions of people have lived and died on this earth and nothing remains of, well, their remains. Markers are very transient items, as are human remains themselves. Even bone disappears in most cases. To insist on markers is simply trying to exert power over a matter that is none of the church's concern.  It is not likely that those who loved the deceased or God will forget their names.  He also has no concern for the comfort some practices bring to those who grieve. I would not keep ashes in my home, but it comforts some and hurts none.  The anonymous """"community of faith"""" should not outweigh the preferences of the family.

Let's just hope the City is smart enough to write the deal so incentives are contingent upon the number of employees hired and located in a Denver metro office.  That's why I support a payroll tax break based on the number of employees hired.  If Amazon scales down the scope of the campus the size and value of State incentives decrease too.  If Amazon wants to take advantage of the incentives Denver metro is offering than they better earn them by hiring many high paying folks to work and contribute to the economy here in Colorado.

A simple tax change would ensnare domestic and foreign buyers alike who buy and sell as a business, exactly like stock and bond traders, and would resolve that issue quickly.  So would providing automatic increases in density for housing built on major public transit corridors, i.e., the entire Bloor/Danforth stretch across Toronto.

0,"Here's the real problem with this russia issue.  It seems many people are hell bent on making sure Trump does not try to normalize relations with Russia.  Even if the Russians did try to influence the american election, grown ups know that any world leader who knows what he is doing will try to influence election outcomes, sometimes it sort of works (Putin with US), in other cases it doesn't (Obama with Israel, Brexit vote, Olympic bid, this list is rather long, so I will stop here).  Back to the real problem.  It's no longer wise to wish away troublesome leaders, you need to find a way to have open dialog with them as long as they are behaving rationally.   The constant goading of Trump to turn Russia into a mortal enemy could very well force the donald to go shoot down some russian jet to prove he is not a russian plant and THAT would be a manufactured disaster by people who keep trying to say Trump can't try to get a cordial relationship going.

The editorial before the election implored voters 'to hold their noses' and vote for Christy Clark's government. Mr. Mason praised Ms. Clark's 'campaign' afterwards. The election showed clearly, people were conflicted about many issues with the government. As a new BCer I read all media to get the lay of the land. I believe the Globe glossed over the Liberals weak attempt to change fundraising laws, in favour of endorsing them. One journalist deserving of recognition is Justine Hunter, who beat the The New York Times in exposing BC's 'wild west' campaign finance laws, by a nose.

They make great inmates, quiet, always following the rules, make great workers under a control environment.

In other words if your earning a living, your employer is paying your insurance.  The State picks up the tab for those uninusured through programs like quest for free.  Immigrant populations such as those from Micronesia are partially covered through Federal programs which the Fed's should pay for radiating their homeland.  However, few medical professionals accept the low end coverages provided by Obama care/medicaid type insurances.  The reimbursement levels are so poor that they don't even begin to cover costs and if you think single payor systems like Medicare are efficient or easy to deal with then you are fooling yourself.  Medicare which is administered by agencies like Noridian are bureaucratic nightmares that providers don't want to touch.  Good luck with your single payor fallacy because no private provider will want to participate in it.

No environmental laws to speak of. They export illegal unskilled workers and do nothing to stop it. I realize you would like that situation on Canada's border but a lot of us wouldn't want open borders. How would you like to have 10 million illegals roaming around Canada. A small portion committing crimes and no consequence in sanctuary cities. I realize that works for you Barrie but not for a lot of folks in the USA. Canada currency all over the map last 30 years but not to the extreme of Mexico. How do folks in USA compete with Quebec dairy mess. Bad enough Canadians have to pay for it but not a fair trade deal. USA is protecting the world and they are tired of lousy trade deals. Hopefully the last one they did was Iran. The stronger the USA the stronger Canada.

Business decisions are forward looking with a 5 to 10 year time frame, which  crystal-balls  the future political, economic and social  climate.

What's more, you have to wonder if the inmates' probation officers were involved in the deliberate extension of sentencing.  But the bottom line here is that the inmates should have known before they left court what their specific sentencing date  was.  There's plenty of blame to go around.  Governor Walker needs to order an in-depth investigation and then penalize the people responsible for inappropriate extended imprisonment of inmates.  The people responsible should be fired and fined.  Imprisoning 100 or more people  beyond their original sentencing isn't a mistake, it's an act of  vigilantism.

0,"Regrettably your comments seem spot on for this Pontifical Commission. One way of ensuring its failure is to starve it of resources, as three members have already testified to the Australian Royal Commission. And another way of ensuring that canon law is not touched is by appointing a canon lawyer who does not speak the common language of all the others (English), and then when he resigns, not appointing another competent English speaking one in his place. Fortunately not all Commissions are like that and the Australian Royal Commission is a very good example. It is obvious from some of the comments made by the Commissioners that substantial changes to canon law and practice are going to be recommended. One would have thought that the clever thing to have done was to make the changes before we see another example of secular society dragging the Church into the realities of the modern world. If the Church cannot design a decent disciplinary system, civil law will impose it.

0,"Rebuild our military. A campaign slogan that does not meet the reality of the military we currently have.  I hear the strength of the military is not what it was in the past. True, we no longer use sail to power our fleet and the current aircraft can fly thousands of miles not hundreds.  Currently we have a high tech drone force where an operator in the US can hover over a target in the ME for hours before directing a strike on a target. How does that compare to a few spotters sitting on a hill with binoculars to seek out target coordinates. How does the newest super-carrier compare to carriers of the past? It is incomparable.  Trying to compare the strength of our military is a very subjective process. The process needs to be honest and not simply fall back on what things were in the past. If the past is the standard then I expect a rise in the number of horse mounted calvary and a reduction in orders for super-carriers.

To preach the Gospel, they tried to recover a sense of Jesus as the creator of peace. They promoted the community aspect of the liturgy. They reassessed our ties to the Jews, and to all people, emphasizing what we share. They reaffirmed conscience as the place where we meet God against the totalitarian authoritarianism.

The term had a nice California feel, and Mr. Royko eventually began applying it when he wrote about the Golden State’s young, idealistic and nontraditional chief executive. He found endless amusement — and sometimes outright agita — in California’s oddities, calling the state “the world’s largest outdoor mental asylum.”  “If it babbles and its eyeballs are glazed,” he noted in April 1979, “it probably comes from California.”  Speaking Parnel, a local favorite!

As far as the cost of the actual care is concerned, that's not part of what I've talking about. Yes, the costs for doctors and services increases every year, and that is going to happen with any replacement for Obamacare. People who think their premiums will decrease are only fooling themselves.

0,"Housing and maintenance is delivered through Canadian Mortgage and Housing Agency (CMHC) across the country to all Canadians under the National Housing Act. The same programs are available for everyone. Housing loans or subsidies are available to qualified corporations, municipalities, co-operatives and First Nations Bands for rental or rent-to-own housing projects.  About 31% of on reserve First Nations families purchase and own their own homes. This compares to 69% among off reserve Canadians. Home ownership is difficult for on reserve families because banks will not offer mortgages. Not surprisingly, 57% of on-reserve families live in subsidized rental units (about 45,885 households). That compares to 5% of the Canadian population or about 450,000 households. Shelter subsidy rates based on income are the same.  The median income of Canadian families was about $78,000 in 2014 compared to $14,000 for on reserve families. Not a lot of room for rent, utilities and household repairs.

It's been my task to ask a government employee to dress more conservatively. However, in the private sector, I found some employers and employees find that more revealing ways of dressing carries an advantage in dealing with the public. Regardless of how the employee dresses, all employees have a right to expect respect. Staff in this case are trained to know what it means to have a """"respectful work environment for all employees free from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, violence, and other offensive or degrading remarks or conduct.” But people come from different family backgrounds. They don't always drop their family norms at the door.  Still, that is not an excuse.  People have to show respect but they can't be forced to have feelings of respect.

It shifts some part of the risk from being exclusively on the payor to being shared with the providers. And now with Trump, the direction they've all been rowing in with the ACA is about to change yet again. They have trouble attracting docs into primary care because the workload is too heavy and billing is too complicated. And the complexities of administering Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and multiple commercial payor systems is a nightmare. Plus they have entire departments to deal with collections. Many are leaving their practices to join hospital systems where they give up a lot of control over patient care for the security of a paycheck.

Greater disclosure will also reveal welfare subsdies that make no finanical sense- and reporters will be better able to describe the cost of the boondoggle known as SB-21.  For example, Dermot writes about $7 billion in cash welfare in a small project- but misses the muich bigger cost to Alaska.  The welfare is not specific to the cost of the project, but to a time duration.  In the case of """"new oil"""" the production welfare runs for seven years.  So Alaska is on the hook to pay $8 per barrel for seven years.  Any rational company will exploit this bad law and accelerate production to collect larger welfare payments from Alaska.  For example- pulling 200,000 barrels per day from the new development will cost Alaska $1.6 million per day- or $584 million per year- or $4 billion over 7 years- for $25 billion worth of oil.  ($50 bbl).

Instead the author delivered a Cliff's note version of the Republican political playbook.   Unexamined blame placing on one party, vague promises of undefined policies and of course,  the required 'poor is me complaint,' that the other kids aren't playing fair.   Don't get me wrong, the same thing can come from the intellectual left.   I was just hoping for something more interesting.  The country does have major challenges in a quickly evolving global environment: environmental degradation, religious fanaticism, huge arsenals of weapons, economic insecurity and economic collapse.  Less time placing blame and more time spend on finding common ground to face national challenges would help.    I think I'll pass on this 'philosophy'of contrived good and evil.

While electoral reform might not necessarily require a constitutional amendment, some forms of it certainly would and the Supreme Court, in the past, has taken a pretty broad view of what does and does not require a Constitutional Amendment.  Trying to pass any electoral reform change through Parliament without a referendum or a Constitutional Amendment would almost certainly result in a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court and, given the timing, that would almost certainly happen AFTER the election.  What that means is anyone's guess but it would certainly call into question the legitimacy of any government elected in such an election.

0,"It is easy to forget just how bad some of us have it. When you've never dealt with - or experienced - anything like poverty it is easy to jibe that by paying taxes you do your bit and the fault lies entirely with politicians.  The matter has nothing to do with fault and blame, but how we treat other citizens. After all, poverty is the breeding ground for institutionalized crime, and THAT we all either experience or gripe about daily.  When everyone who lives in this country has an opportunity to live a better life (not the one promised by politicians - but the one you carve out for yourself), we will all be better off. Is it any wonder that political parties score points at election times with a few food parcels?  Another indication of just how bad things are just under a deceptively calm surface, have a look at people on buses and trains every morning.

[National Intelligence Director James] Clapper may be present once or twice a week, but most often one of his deputies is in attendance in case an intelligence community issue arises.  When Pincus refers to the “morning meeting,” he is describing a regular national security meeting that is held every day at 9:30 a.m. with the president’s top advisers. In his article, he cites a meeting that took place on Jan. 13, 2012, that included discussion of the PDB with one of Clapper’s deputies.

A corporation can only lose money in the US for so many years before they aren't considered a business but a hobby. This has gotten them out of paying US income tax, but they would need a new business every 3 years, thus the reason why he has multiple corporations registered to him. With money being laundered through the US, and with the filing of business loss on income taxes, I imagine the US Federal Trade Commission, the IRS, and the Justice Department are going to want to talk to Ashish now that these revelations have come out.

Anyone can look up class curriculum and agendas and satisfy this training on their own with similar procedures as the seminaries use.  You are correct, sexism like racism is a form of hatred.  So when our church treats women less than men & strips them of their sacred rights to equal sacraments, it is an act of hatred & sin to do so, just as much as stripping a black man from his right to be a priest based on his skin color would be an act of hatred.  We have sinned in the past.  Some our church's orders owned black slaves in America.  I will call hatred hate, and sexism is hatred.  Our laws demand we treat all the same and follow the Great Commandment as a dogma and our Canon Law then states, as mere doctrine or tradition, we ordain only men.

The church was able to carve out a happy compromise for its members where they could obey the commandment and still be patriotic in wartime.  The draft ended and the issue changed.  Now the church had to deal with members volunteering for military service; something no good Adventist did in the past.   Were these enlisted men now not good Adventists?  The church accommodated its membership.  In the past the church dictated to its members our agreed understanding.  Now we leave it to the individual's conscience.

Second most of the people who die in crotch rocket accidents are the riders and passengers of the bike itself. Crotch rockets don’t kill a lot of automobile drivers. On the other hand, most gun deaths are not the shooter.  Most gun deaths are either intended or unintended third party (or multiple party) recipients of a hot lead slug.

1,"In this case I definitely agree.  And, that travel ban was an absolute joke.  But, one area where the loudmouth gets tripped up where some of his moves would advance the nation is with illegal immigrants.  Nope, not talking about that stupid wall...I'm talking about getting illegals out of the country, and states/cities claiming themselves to be sanctuary cities.  Illegals should not be here, they cost a lot of resource, and there's a segment of them who are pretty nasty criminals.  Managing our third world neighbor's supply of illegals to this country would be a good thing to support.

0,"This is indeed a very bad idea to lock budget spending issues permanently into the State Constitution.   That is not at all where budgeting decisions should be implemented.  And this money would not go to providing any actual services to our veterans.   It will just pay for advisers that will hopefully help them get benefits from the Federal government.  Also, with the current school funding crisis, why divert money that is currently earmarked to our schools, to veterans instead?   And again, the money will not actually fund any benefits.   It will simply pay for adding more bureaucracy to the process.  If there is a bureaucracy problem at the VA in helping veterans, I question that adding even more bureaucracy is the answer for that problem.

0,"Ice ages come and ice ages go. Every 100,000 years or so there has been a predictable warming period during which polar glaciers melt and sea levels rise. Then another ice age arrives and the process repeats. Climatologists may have worked out the final answer. Peter Huybers and Carl Wunsch compared the timing of the last seven thaws, They found that the planet’s slant has a major impact. “Earth is tilted on its axis, but it’s not always the exact same tilt,” explains Huybers. The axis goes up and down a few degrees in 40,000-year cycles. “When the tilt is at its highest, more sunlight hits the higher latitudes, melting the ice.” Earth has cooled since then, allowing the cycle to skip a beat.  The world has seen cycles of glaciation with ice sheets advancing and retreating on 40,000- and 100,000-year time scales called glacial periods, glacials or glacial advances, and interglacial periods, interglacials or glacial retreats.

0,"The ACA needs bipartisan adjustments and the premise that the entire Republican caucus must agree to a bill for it to pass is insanity. If they created a bill that at least half the Democrats could support, then they would not need the Freedom Caucus. Of course, to do that the minor tax cuts to the top 2% of families would have to stand or be replaced by a more general value added tax. The latter could happen as part of comprehensive tax reform, but the prior will not because it would be seen as throwing GOP donors under the bus. This bill may succeed, if so this is all choreography, but without Democratic support, the Conference Report has no chance. Failure may kill the issue, but the leadership might want that anyway. It is truly interesting to see whether the Freedom Caucus will grow up, support the bill and move it to the Senate, knowing that it will come back looking very different.

0,"You are seriously overstating the case. For the record, land ice has been melting for the past 10,000 years and with a non eccentric orbit the earth is likely to keep warming. To comfort yourself, go to the Parks Canada Glacier national park www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/bc/glacier/natcul/natcul1/glacier.aspx  Here  you will see that this most studied of glaciers experienced massive melt-offs in the late 1880's, the 1930's and again in the latter part of the last century. This is not to suggest that human inputs of GHG do not play a role in atmospheric temp change but if you study ice recession objectively you will see that other, non-human factors are at play in the warming trend. The tragedy of the politicization of climate change is that little research is being directed to non anthropogenic factors of atmospheric change.

They chose to serve this nation, and when there are shortcomings with the VA, they affect every veteran of every color.  Minorities did not choose their skin color. They were born into it. They are affected disproportionally to caucasians. They are killed, in public, because of their skin color or neighborhood.  One of these two things warrants protesting. The other warrants political changes. One is a systemic problem. One is an administrative problem. One is an apple, and one is an orange.

If you buy an ex-rental pickup truck, there's a good chance it had hard use, and maybe even some industrial use.  If you were to buy an ex-rental sports sedan, maybe a Mustang or something, it's possible it's been redlined by 24-year-olds with more testosterone than brains.  But if you just get a Nissan Maxima or something, you'll probably have an OK experience.

As a Canadian, I don't want to see mass deportations because every recession the US has impacts Canada as well, and we really don't need more economic challenges to deal with.

Now that white folks are clearly the majority of drug addicts in the 21st century, white folks want more drug treatment programs. When the drug addicts are minorities, the answer is mass incarceration. This country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. All they had to do is give up their immigrant status and become white. They do that by learning to fear and hate black people in particular and racial minorities in general. That is a choice the rest of us don't have.

0,"In 1866, a “torpedo” put in the bottom of an existing oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania, filled the well with water, and then detonated the charge, and fracking was born.  In 1967 and '69, scientists detonated a 29-kiloton bomb near Farmington, New Mexico, in a gas well. This was part of “Project Plowshare” which attempted to find peaceful uses for nuclear power, BUT the gas was laced with radioactive tritium and other isotopes.  Fracking uses over 900 chemicals in their fluids, many undisclosed, and it releases underground radiation that can get into water aquifers.  Earthquakes are also associated with fracking, across the country.  Cook Inlet is the only coastal waterbody in the nation where oil and gas corps legally dump up to 2 BILLION gallons of toxic waste in rich fisheries EACH YEAR, because treating the waste is too expensive.

My confusion was that other demonstrators who seem to be worried that Trump is going to do something that will drastically impact their lives were interspersed with those who seemed to be demonstrating in some woman related issue.

I'm sure if available data on the sale of """"average"""" houses (like location, size, age, and condition) were correctly considered in Regional Multiple Listing Service's simplistic averages, it would paint a somewhat different picture.

0,"That NDP Leader John Horgan is now apparently prepared to discard his election promise to hold a referendum on electoral reform and move directly to imposing proportional representation is simply appalling. Something as fundamental as the manner in which we elect representatives should be put to the people to endorse or reject. To cook up some scheme in concert with the Greens and then impose it is so utterly undemocratic and authoritarian it should cause serious pause for all British Columbians. This is nothing more than an unprincipled grab for power by the NDP. Quite willing to appease the Green's own highly undemocratic approach to electoral reform. A referendum is simply a basic common right of the people. You will hear all the proportional representation cranks and loons come out vociferously in favour of imposing a new system. Of course that's what they want.  But hey, if you want to import an absurd system that Italy uses to global ridicule look no further than Green / NDP.

It's the arrogance of bureaucratic leadership to believe that they can manage the personalities, goals, skills of any organization just because they have led other groups.   Nobody suggest that Bill Belicheck takes over the reins of the Yankees.  Trump success as promotor/salesmen for high priced real estate for the very wealthy, does not mean his skills are transferable to non-profit public service spanning all income groups.

Then, separately, the same people will complain that too little is being invested in real estate, so some other cohort of bad people must be taxed so that the government can buy and build housing, and bestow it upon the good people at below market rates.

If there is any doubt about the existence of racial discrimination I probably will not go there.  If the last year hasn't convinced a person that racism is common in the nation, then I'm only going to be angry or frustrated.  I do not want that to be the case with you LFS.

If Trump had chosen to stay in the Accords, he would have had plenty of praise, from both the left and the right.  But that way wouldn't have looked like, or felt to Trump like, a win.  It would have felt like a backdown.  It would have the taint of the loser about it. Since Trump cares only for looking and feeling like a winner, he had to do the splashy thing: claim to be the great champion of American interests against foreigners.  Sound policy be damned.  Trump says we will withdraw from the Accords, but that he will negotiate a way back in, or bring about some sort of new accord.  Either way, Trump envisions posing as the Great Deal Maker, the leader who has the power to bring lesser men around to his way of thinking.  In reality, he doesn't have the faintest idea how a sprawling international agreement like Paris is actually done.

Now we agree that both officers were in the wrong. Wrong is wrong. It doesn't matter how serious the offense. If an officer cannot uphold his oath, he should not serve.

0,"These constant race mongering articles are a disgrace to the MAINSTREAM press. It is shocking to see this and it is dangerous. Immigration is a government policy like anything else. It can be changed, expanded or limited depending on the needs of the country. Economic AND Cultural considerations matter. In 1970 just 5% of Americans were foreign born and the population had largely assimilated the millions of Central, Southern and Eastern Europeans of the late 1800s added to the largely Anglo Protestant base culture. Since then immigration has expanded dramatically and diversified greatly with nearly all immigrants coming from the third world. California has gone from an over 80% white state in the 1970s to 35% white by 2017. Hispanics now outnumber whites in California, New Mexico and among the young in Texas and Arizona. People are not crazy or racist to feel like they are being replaced, they are. Economically, big change is needed. 49% of current immigrants are on a welfare program.

To deprive competent and responsible citizens of the right to own guns as a means of self-defense is most certainly not the answer.

It is based on projected income. They then receive a 1095-B to reconcile the amount they received against their actual income and eligibility and either receive a refund or pay anything due based on the final figures. I really wish the politicians would be explaining more about the ACA before election. There are a lot of exemptions to paying the penalty. I do wish the poor who simply cannot afford the premiums and are under the income required to obtain a subsidy (why??? they are the most in need) would be offered the help they need. I know people gamble with their insurance, hoping they don't need it, and those mostly are people who could pay for it but don't. That is the main driver of the increase in insurance costs.Working the kinks out would be better than trash talk.

Sadly, the America First crowd puts bias over science to limit this model in the public schools. It is good that Catholic schools are fighting back. I double dare the Secretary of Education to give these students vouchers.

0,"'Critical insolation–CO2 relation for diagnosing past and future glacial inception' Nature (2016)  """"Using an ensemble of simulations generated by an Earth system model of intermediate complexity constrained by palaeoclimatic data, we suggest that glacial inception was narrowly missed before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The missed inception can be accounted for by the combined effect of relatively high late-Holocene CO2 concentrations and the low orbital eccentricity of the Earth. Additionally, our analysis suggests that even in the absence of human perturbations no substantial build-up of ice sheets would occur within the next several thousand years and that the current interglacial would probably last for another 50,000 years. However, moderate anthropogenic cumulative CO2 emissions of 1,000 to 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years.""""  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7585/full/nature16494.html

However, since foreign affairs and international relations are a Federal responsibility, why are Provincial governments saddled with paying for it?  This (like the focus on Syrian refugees/migrants) is yet another article on a subject (foreign students) that is highlighting another program, that frankly most Canadians at the very least question, if not disagree with, and generates a flurry of posts that demonstrate this..

Their solution to the disorder is for everyone else to go a long with the gag and enable the person's delusion.  For example, in the case of someone who is clearly a man, but thinks they are a women--liberals tell us that we have to play along with their mental delusion.  Doctors change their appearance to make the  man look more feminine.  The law gives them a paper that claims what is clearly a man is not legally considered a women.  That is what I disagree with. You don't treat what is clearly a mental disorder by trying to alter objective reality and force it to conform to a mental delusion.

While for the present , prediction was that Trump would establish his position while those opposing him in nomination would drop or get defeated , success or otherwise in November 2016 for him would be concluded after weighing strength of  stars of person opposing him. I would come up with such a prediction well in advance. But as said about 37 days past from now , stars of Trump are gaining more strength and  convenience in November 2016 and after. So it can be hinted that he stands a strong chance then to succeed.

I am not a smoker, but we have determined the age of 18 to be the age of consent. Limiting personal liberties of adults should be studied and weighed very carefully. We already limit where it can be done publicly for it's harmful effects on others, at what point is it acceptable to limit the risks an adult chooses to take in their own actions?

The CAD system may be a one-time purchase, but like all technology it has to be maintained and upgraded periodically to keep operational. Factor in IT costs, and regular equipment replacement (broken keyboards, bad monitors, etc).  Many centers, including those in Anchorage are not 8-hr a day jobs, they work 4x10s designed to give a surge of people during the busiest hours of the day. This also is important to prevent burn out by giving them longer weekends, which studies of the field has shown is vital to preventing burnout or worse, substance abuse or suicides.  Anchorage maintains 2 centers, one at APD and one at AFD that perform vital and different missions. A third site at the city EOC is also maintained for disasters where one center is unusable.

Even greater evidence of the ignorance of these """"we know best"""" fanatics is that JWN has led the on-the-ground push for """"missing middle"""" housing.  JWN members conducted a community-based planning process that won national recognition, and we developed a proposal for discretionary approval of """"courtyard cottages"""" and other compact, affordable housing forms that would be compatible with the established neighborhood. Eugene Planning Division staff killed that important element of the S-JW proposal before it got to the City Council.  The JWN also ran the pilot community workshops for the council-mandated """"Opportunity Siting"""" process, and neighbors successfully identified scores of potential sites in the JWN where higher density and missing-middle housing could be built.

But in general you would expect somewhat more women would be in some fields and somewhat more men in other fields.  So aside from the issue of Google summarily firing someone for expressing doubts about the wisdom of the company's diversity policy (when, supposedly, the company welcomed a 'diversity' of employee opinions), the other question is whether the policy realistic or not.

A good therapist will help an individual work through issues and enable them to see them more clearly. If the issues are real (dangerous neglect, serious abuse etc.) a good doctor will help their patient work past the anger/fear etc. If the issues seem more trivial (feeling resentful of having to wear your siblings hand-me-downs) or have a whiff of entitlement or even narcissism (my parents never bought me the new car I needed or they never recognized my obvious genius) then the therapist will try to bring the patient to a better understanding of reasonable expectations.

SB21 needs to have oil tax credits fixed (i.e. removed) and taxes at low $ oil raised.  I believe that we need to make all the fixes in parallel rather one at a time.  Fix oil tax credits and tax rates on low $ and new oil.  Reduce the PFD for 3 years.

0,"You think Rome invented the sacrificial nature of the mass, eh? When you take Rome's word for it, it is quite easy to be hoodwinked into believing just about anything.  From a solidly Jewish resource, for example:  """"Sacrifice is an ancient and universal human expression of religion. Greeks and Romans and Canaanites and Egyptians all offered sacrifices to their gods. Sacrifice existed among the Hebrews long before the giving of the Torah. Cain and Abel offered sacrifices; Noah and his sons offered sacrifices, and so forth. When the laws of sacrifice were given to the Children of Israel in the Torah, the pre-existence of a system of sacrificial offering was understood, and sacrificial terminology was used without any explanation."""" (jewfaq-dot-org)  Do you not know that early Christian worship was forbidden under Rome's purview, and that early followers gathered in people's homes for worship and thanksgiving? Rome didn't even differentiate it from Judaism until about 50AD--c'mon now Trid!

In the Roman rite according to Saint Eutichiano, St. Leo and St. Gregory it is on the tongue.

(10 years being 2015.)  The fund only earned 5.2% over a decade! What are they investing in? It's as if their entire investment strategy is to produce cash today to pay current retirees with little no risk of even temporary drops in asset value without any regard for long-term investment to cover current workers.  If that is what they're doing (I assume to make up loses from 2008) then it might be ultimately better for tax-payers to issue bonds today at low interest rates to make up these losses in a lump sum in order to stave-off future tax increases to cover retirement for current workers that the fund is """"reappropriating"""" to cover today.

But is would not be only Chretien and Martin and their officials, it would be CSIS and security officials too., This  was right after 9/11 when panic was the order of the day and it is a good warning  not to let fear override basic civil liberties  .But it would be Harper,Kenny and their government officials who would have the most to answer for in court.. This settlement saved their bacon.  The main reason the settlement was so large is the multi year stonewalling by the Harper government that kept Khadr in Guantanamo  even after the Americans wanted to send him home. All other western countries had their citizens repatriated, Harper did the opposite and set up Canada for this payout.

If the wall has portals (gates/doors), the debris can be screened out of the water and the """"good water"""" can be let in.  Only at the gates can the immigrants be vetted, granted proper papers, granted rights and benefits...  Without proper documentation, immigrants enter illegally and are in danger and are often taken advantage of.

0,"I'm not sure why this debate is always about those who support immigration and those who are against it.  For example, I favour immigration too - just a whole lot less of it.  My objection relates to the huge numbers (300,000+ and counting), proposals to increase those numbers even more and the fact that the vast majority of this flood of immigrants settle in one of 3 or 4 cities in Canada, which are now all but bursting at the seams.  However vast Canada's land, the habitable part of it is probably not much more than that of a small to middling sized European nation.  If automation will kill up to 30-40% of all jobs by 2030, if our young people are unemployed or underemployed, if our social services, especially health care, cost more and more - it doesn't make sense to have so many newcomers, an additional expense for years to come, immigrate to this country.

0,"Henry VIII actually had solid grounds for an annulment, Catherine of Aragon had originally been married to Henry's brother, Arthur, who died. One needs a dispensation to marry your brother's widow, and Henry's father had pressured the Archbishop of Canterbury into giving it. Thus, Henry had a justified claim that the dispensation was improperly given.  However, Catherine opposed the annulment, probably because she didn't want her daughter Mary to lose her place as Henry's heir. So she claimed that she  had never consummated her marriage to Arthur. She also got her nephew, Charles II, to oppose the annulment. Charles, who disliked Henry both personally and politically, was happy to oblige his aunt.  Among other things, Charles was King of Naples. Naples and the Papal States had recently had a war. The pope lost, and didn't want a rerun. So he pretended to take Catherine's claim seriously.  Henry forced his hand when he broke with Rome. That's why the annulment was denied.

Having said that, the investment philosophy needs to take tax efficiency into consideration. Since mortgage payments (including interest) are made with after-tax money, the after-tax margin between interest rate and return rate can easily widen making an even stronger case for investing. The added benefit is financial flexibility. In the event that interest rates rise significantly, investments can always be cashed out to pay down the mortgage.

There is probably no more help for them than there is for the likes of Kim Jong Un. And still Trump tweets his distain for others without (seemingly) any comprehension of the consequences.

The European church will be held responsible for transferring it's problems to Australia since the 1950's including Irish religious & clerics that were exported out of the way.  I expect it to be as hard hitting as the reports from the Irish Judicial Reviews and because of cumulative effect of both the Irish & the Australian reports. Having said that; the reality is that few convictions emerged in the Irish courts in subsequent years. The hierarchy protected it's own and still act as if they have nothing to be accountable for. ACCOUNTABILITY is still the big issue and they must face it or fade away in irrelevance. The one exception is the current Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin who is a realist.

And, what happens to the younger folks looking for jobs as they graduate.  It is already bad enough for them - here's one glaringly bad example.  A teacher retires early at say age 55 - with a well-above average pension I might add, and immediately applies for part-time or substitute teaching thereby taking away chances for newly graduated up-to-date teachers to join the workforce.  Who wins - only the retired teacher.  Schools lose fresh blood joining teaching ranks.  Students lose as older teachers aren't as up-to-date on methods and subject matter knowledge.  Tax payers lose as teacher funding gets scr*wed.

How effective? So much so, that Republicans now target the agency for destruction.    Wells Fargo Bank last year after it came to light the bank pressured its employees to open at least two million false accounts in the names of current customers. The bank was also forced to settle a customer lawsuit for $110 million and was downgraded by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a key regulator, for these predatory practices.   As law and economics professor William K. Black, Jr. told us last year, those actions amount to “two million felonies.”

The solar-wind industry justify the $0.38/kwh price by pegging the footprint cost of a tonne of CO2 emissions at $500.

But hedge fund managers have management fees regardless of outcome, and they have no sizable stake to lose if things go south. They just make the base rate.

The point being that regardless of the penalty people do stupid things and being a successful business owner or professional isn't much different than being an addict when it comes to committing crimes.  We've had trustees stealing from trusts in Alaska, doctors stealing from Medicare and Medicaid and now medical businesses stealing from medical practices.  Think of Bernie Madoff.  Or the oil companies that falsified records or ignored federal laws.  Wells Fargo cheating customers, politicians taking bribes and the list goes on and on and on.

0,"Pallister has started negotiations too so this is almost finished.  Galloway should have mentioned that the 6% per annum increases was never intended to be permanent but it was provided for ten years by Paul Martin to make up for cuts in healthcare transfers that he made while eliminating the deficit. Harper, surprisingly, extended it for a year or two. Also missing is the fact that the 3% or GDP growth formula was created by Harper and Flaherty to kick in after the 6% deal ended, it is not a Liberal invention. Finally, the Liberals offered additional money over the Harper/Flaherty formula provided that metrics were put in place to show that the money was being spent in certain areas of health care, I believe mental health and home care.  The Province initially banded together to turn down the deal and come up with that 5.2% figure but have gradually all negotiated to take Ottawa's original offer. They might have been able to get a better deal if they hadn't highballed.

Remember that Jan Smuts lost his """"safe"""" UP seat in the 1948 elections. I support the DA position that a majority of MP's should be beholden to their CONSTITUENCIES rather than to the party, but I nevertheless feel that the 75/25 split will certainly be outdated if the Motion-of-no-Confidence in Zuma SUCCEEDS this time around and the ANC splits between pro-Zuma and anti-Zuma factions etc, etc. If we now have elections this year there should not only be a strong drive to implement mixed constituency-based and list-based MP's in future elections, but the number of ministeries should also be constitutionally limited to 25 to 30 ministeries.

Instead, he killed 26 church-goers during Sunday morning services and his in-laws were not even there. People have complex motives that can include more than one issue. Kelley may have had a domestic problem with his in-laws, but he clearly had a problem with Christians to premeditatedly kill 26 of them in their church, including children as young as 5 years old, a pregnant woman, a 72 year old, etc. Whatever other motive may have been involved, it certainly was also a religious hate crime. Denying something this obvious places your manner of thinking regarding Christians more in line with Kelley's than mainstream thought. I recommend you not go there. The investigators will likely realize this soon and change their opinion, or perhaps they were misquoted or taken out of context in the first place.

What does this tell us? Consider also that antis have no vested interest: no-one is paying them to participate, unlike some of the pro comments, which might be planted by those who financially benefit.  Among the pro comments, hardly any have ever said “I want it so I can commute faster to my job”. What does this tell us? My conclusion is that among people who care and have paid attention to the situation, there is no support for rail.  They realize how ridiculous and tragic the situation is. Public opinion polls are problematic. Asking someone for an opinion on something they don’t know much about yields worthless, misleading results.  The best we can hope for now is salvage the mess we are stuck with, as I explain in this story.

0,"We've seen it time and again, yet the ease with which a US president can wipe the media clean of criticism against his administration never ceases to amaze me. Just identify an external threat. Even the press that's hostile to the president has to along with it.  In America's polarized politics, media that's for or against the president alienates half the available viewers. But media that focuses on some claimed external threat gets everyone listening. All the president's bad news disappears, while his steadfast stand against some foreign danger looks like heroism in the public's eye.  I'm not picking on Trump here. Obama did it before him, and Bush and Clinton did it before that. What I'm pointing out is the myth of the 'free press' in the West. While the media may be financially independent from government, governments can so easily bend it to their will that effectively the media isn't free at all.

And it would have decreased them more had Republicans collaborated with Democrats to fix the known issues instead of doing everything in their power to sabotage it. And this year alone the premium increases of 7% to 38% are directly caused by Trump's executive order and the uncertainty in the market caused by Republican inability (and lack of desire, frankly) to do ANYTHING positive for Americans in healthcare.

I don't know who is at fault this time, whether is it one, the other, or both of them but I have no doubt that greed is a part of it.

However, if I stayed one night in Kamloops, then I would get the flight at much fewer points.  Knowing that there should be absolutely no shortage of flights between Calgary and Vancouver, it made no sense at all to require a stopover in Kamloops to lower the miles.  In my mind, it was solely a way to use up more points or waste the person's time.

When their husbands discarded them for a younger model (as our president has done twice) these women were left to fend for themselves, which often meant begging or prostitution. Jesus wanted the men to honor their contracts in order to save women from certain ruin. Nowadays we have something called alimony, and while courts may not always treat divorced women completely fairly, in most cases they are not left destitute, and women these days also have a say in whether their marriage will be dissolved or not, a choice that women living in first century Palestine were never given.  In terms of historical contexts, you're comparing apples with oranges. Jesus would have almost certainly taken those considerations into account. Or at least, I believe he would have.

The working assumption then was """"if you want to be holy..if you want your children to be holy....they need to be religious"""".  Before it became fashionable to cry about """"clericalism"""" Opus Dei was busy helping lay people see that their way to be holy was to sanctify their ordinary world....not leave it....to see that the events of the life of the lay """"need to be sanctified too"""". There were insufficient priests to oversee the formation needed...the main """"distribution"""" was to religious priests..or to diocesan priests.

I’ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there. It’s like Vietnam, sort of. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave solider.”  Trump made similar comments in a 1993 interview with Stern:  “You know, if you’re young, and in this era, and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam, we have our own Vietnam — it’s called the dating game.  Dating is like being in Vietnam. You’re the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam.”  And unlike Blumenthal, Trump never lied about his role in the great dating game war.

Yes, CPI is low (but not inflation) but one needs to understand how it's calculated before saying that inflation is low.  A large part of CPI is home ownership  cost, which remains low due to low mortgage interest rates over the past 5 years.  Imagine what would happen to mortgage interest rates if the BoC rate rises? When I look around at what I spend my money on everything is more expensive.  Food costs are rising faster than the S&P index.  Muni taxes for the last 5 years have averaged about 8% per year.

One way to proceed is by starting with 2 formal corrections by cardinals - one private, one public - and then the invocation of a perfect council (w/ papal approval) or an imperfect council (w/out papal approval) which then decides if the pope committed a public heresy.  If so, there is a choice between the Jesuit option and the Benedictine option as to how to warn the faithful to beware of the heretic and the heresy.  Because of the many heresies being promoted by this pope and his minions, I think the best way may be the posthumous process by which the next Pope basically turns Francis into the papacy that never was for a variety of reasons including but not limited to any combination of the possible coercion of Benedict's resignation, the lobbying of the St. Gallen mafia in the election of Francis, top 10 heresies, pertinacity, etc.  Benedict also expanded the papal ministry to include an active and contemplative member.  I think he opened the door to the unknown.

What Cole doesn't say is that the problem compounding the problem of oil pricing and pipeline through put is that for the period 2008 to 2016 huge increases in government spending and its workforce doubled over the period, 1976 through 2007; the workforce is now 24,000 strong and growing. Alaska has approximately 1 state employee for every 29 residents. 28% of all workers in Alaska is employed in state government, according to Gallup in a 2012 study. Alaska ranks second to only Washington, D.C. What Cole intentionally fails to disclose here is that there is no prohibition on the legislature using the earnings of the PF to fund government operations; there never has been; all that is required to spend the earnings is a simple up or down vote of the legislature and governor's signature. Big government spenders like Cole need a 12 Step Program and lessons in fear mongering.

We have seen just how much they can spend, we are now waiting for the bill, which inevitably comes with increased taxes. There is no economic magic at play here. When you spend far more then what you have, there is an eventual reckoning. Governments survive of course, , often by passing the debt off to the next party at an election.

I’ll admit it’s better than SFO and LAX, which are covoluted messes, but not SJO. PHX is a joke, but as long RNO gets next to no traffic, it’s by far the best.  Is DEN “efficient,” as Ms. Walsh asserts? Hardly. Security, for the number of passengers it processes, is ridiculously slow. SJO is a breeze, and all airports need to get consistent – belts on or off, loose change left in the pocket or taken out, hats on or off; TSA in Denver can’t even do that stuff the same every time. Worse is baggage check at DEN for the most used airlines.  And no matter where you go, you can’t escape the noxious, offensive odor of Panda Express and McDonalds. Then again, that’s true of all airports in any city.  In short, calling an airport “one of the best” is a rather low bar.

Obviously, hers would be a caretaker presidency, just holding down the fort until the American people got their say in 2020.  But a caretaker would be far preferable to whatever Trump is, and a Democratic president would be in line with the wishes of the majority of the electorate.  Not to mention, provide competence, and take the threat of nuclear annihilation off the map.  Oh, and the Russians would lose their puppet.  So yes, we can make that happen, and we should work our asses to make it happen.   Because President Nancy Pelosi sounds pretty good right about now.

Professor Haycox forgets (assuming he ever knew) that we are not a democracy.  Rather, we are a constitutional republic.  Further, the basic unit of government is the state.  The constitution is a compact between the many states.  The Electoral College ensures that presidential elections are determined by the states rather than the blue rabbit warrens of the left and right coastal cities.  A real Professor of History would refer to the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers to get a real description how this all came to be.

Now Globe columnists will be expected not only to know the multiple dictionary  meanings of the words they choose but also the sexual, political, racial, regional, religious and other identity characteristics of those to whom the words are directed for fear of potentially discomforting the persons referenced.  The last time I can recall anything this ridiculous was several years ago when someone on the Washington, DC city council said that the proposed municipal budget was niggardly (stingy) allocating funds for some project and a black councillor demanded that the comment be removed from the record as being racist.

You will probably have to get through one winter where the Muni will doing a crap job of plowing the roads to try to convince the voters that the tax cap was a bad idea, but if you refuse to cave into their pressure, they'll get used to it and will learn how to streamline the budget so that the taxpayers don't get raped. Otherwise, expect your taxes to go to through the roof now that State revenue sharing is being cut. We didn't move fast enough and it took 10 years under the tax cap to normalize property taxes.

As far as their payment practices are concerned, I don't see why anybody would consider blogging a real job or accept a position like that for $125 a month, and after reading the deadspin article I think it's shameful that Vox structures their company that way.

But they require a certain rigour, which you probably have in mind as 'sophistication'. There is no link between mathematical rigour and neoclassical ideas. Happy to point you to heterodox papers published in top journals. 2. Not sure where you get the implication from. I try to do solid work and I only work with people whom I respect (i.e. nobody I think is bogus). People took Chris' flawed proposal serious because they think he's a great academic. I argue they shouldn't. 3. In my longer email to you I asked about a reference for the claim that peer review is deeply flawed, so I'll re-iterate here. I understand the feeling that peer review is flawed, but in my experience it's not. And my work is heterodox econ, too.  Happy to turn the debate about peer review in a pro-con op-ed if you're interested :)

Theoretically, people who could afford these things might pay for these things, but not many. Right now a partial solution is flood insurance but it covers only a tiny percentage of the true costs and in areas that are prone to heavy flooding, you cannot buy it-- too much risk.

So, the irresponsible and unsupportable paranoia of fluoridation opponents leads to disingenuous requests to halt or not implement a public health measure that protects the health of citizens.  Bottom line is that fluoridation opponents have no legitimate evidence that fluoridation is either ineffective or unsafe.  Consequently they fabricate arguments and evidence to try and convince others to disregard the scientific evidence and fear fluoridation.  As noted elsewhere, that lack of evidence to support anti-F opinions is the reason over 100 national and international science and health organizations continue to recognize the benefits of fluoridation.

If you  study the history of our world, you must understand that wave of immigration often  supplant previous society. Just look at the state of Chaco in northwestern New Mexico. Chances were, they were overrun by immigrating Navajos. Look at the Celtic people of Europe before the Germanic migration and Roman conquests. Tasmanians were not unique.

Guam is the front line 'fort', these islands are north and south of Guam, main location of the US forward fleet. This is NAVAIR strategy, to do live fire training near the expected front. Guam is way too small and too populated for that.  It's just another sign the Pentagon doesn't know what to do with giant artificial islands being engineered into existence, then covered with anti-craft missiles, all within protection from the mainland. It would be a laugh to see a Pentagon cost estimate to do the same. That is, they need to create similar dredged up islands and do their live fire there. That would at least make tactical sense. Looking at the area and installations on the artificial Chinese islands, a Seabee and Army Corp of Engineering project to that scale would be in the many billions of dollars, and the US probably doesn't have the capability. Live fire on these Pacific islands is barbaric.

The barriers to entry are controlled by the governments. ANY Investment whether in a company, savings account or provident fund etc now carries a much higher cost threshold in order to make a decent return and as such the need to specialize in such structures places emphasis on returns for the individual investor and not the greater good of all. As such, there are now more funds than there are listed equities - more cash chasing fewer investments because of a lack of choice. This competition is bad for the masses as the State looks to take so much in the form of taxes. Capital will follow the path of least resistance for the highest return and the more the State looks to interfere in this process, the greater the attempt to bypass the State.

In light of her actions, her great love sounds more personal, less institutional than temple prostitution (or mercantile prostitution, for that matter).

0,"Reality: a seasonal sales tax will generate more tax from residents than from tourist on an individual basis. What tourist spends as much over the time they are in Alaska purchasing taxable good that is  equal to the amount a resident of Alaska will purchase over the entire period goods are taxable?  That is my fundamental question.  For I know over a three month time I will spend $ 1,200 to $ 1,500 a month on items such as groceries, vehicle fuel, and other items.  What number of tourist will spend $ 3.600 to $ 4,500 on taxable items while they are here?  A lot of what tourist spend to vacation in Alaska is for Air fares, cruise cost and housing. Neither air fare or cruise fees are going to generate any sales tax. While there are more tourist over the season than there are residents it is residents who will be paying more individually than a tourist spends. What matter to me is what I will pay not what tourist will pay.

0,"Why is it we in the West assume North Korea wishes to talk with us or that the West's apparent failure to enter into meaningful diplomatic negotiations  (in our own mind) has produced the North's desire to acquire weapons of mass destruction?  North Korea wants one thing: a united Korean peninsula under Communist rule.  Given the world's 50 years of prevarication, it is eminently achievable even without nuclear weapons (see Vietnam).  It is only a question of time before the South surrenders to the North's demand or face instant annihilation.  For the rest of the world the alternative is too horrific to imagine.  So the North will acquire by force or threat of force the Republic of South Korea.  We are too weak and divided to oppose these demands and have demonstrated that weakness for 50 years.  The very thought North Korea would give up its weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them before or even after acquiring South Korea is simply laughable. Nothing will stop them.

"
0,"The other big problem with """"means tested"""" programs is that they impose a sort of 'hidden tax bracket' and those tax brackets are additive.  For some low and mid income families the loss of government benefits have a bigger impact on their effective marginal tax rate than actual taxes do.  Basically think of the example where someone has the opportunity to take an extra shift that will pay them $100 gross. What is the net benefit of them doing so? (Example: two-income couple, living in Ontario, both earning $30,000, 2 kids age 7 and 2):  - Pay $20.05 in extra tax - Lose $13.56 in CCB - Lose $2.04 in Ontario Energy Credit  So they've paid an extra $20.05 and lost $15.60.  At lower income levels they'll see GST/HST credits clawed back and potentially the loss or clawback of Ontario's Electricity Support Program.  At a few specific income levels the extra $100 could actually make a family WORSE off on the whole (eg. $47,950 to $48,050 in Ontario).

0,"Three simple points to attack (but clarify) in all directions: 1) In the modern era (last 150 years): All famines are man-made. Droughts and natural disasters come and go. As Amartya Sen once pointed out, """"There are no famines in democracies."""" 2) Overpopulation? South Sudan is not over-populated. There are fewer people in South Sudan than in Ontario. And compared to Ontario, more of South Sudan is arable or at least pastoral. 3) Overpopulation is not the cause of conflict or famine: see points one and two above. If high population density was the problem, Hong Kong, Singapore, and New York could not exist. Responsibility for South Sudan's calamity has to start with its elites, and the international partners who have enabled them with legitimacy, arms, and misguided financial support.

The media will be unfazed, and they'll still be around long after he's gone.  Trump acts stupidly with the press. He doesn't get it that the more defensively he reacts, the more they're going to pile on. His response may be raw meat for his base, but the rest of the country is getting pretty tired of it, as illustrated by his dismal approval ratings.  Sure, a few reporters may lose their jobs, but a year from now no one will remember them.

0,"Public education is almost always more about political indoctrination, vocational training and  psychological conditioning that it is about imparting the capacity for critical thought.  Historically, there are two aims of American formal education--at all levels. First to impart cultural homogeneity on a nation of foreign immigrants and rural migrants and give those folks a basic skill set for a secular-bourgeois-liberal modern democracy.  The second aim of formal education has been to identify and reward more gifted students and condition them to be a technocratic/professional/managerial class. In very few places and times has any educational institution intended to teach people to question the status quo except in the narrowest mostly technical terms.  Students and faculty who resist conditioning like this are kind of an anomaly.  They happen, rather than result. The tendency of institutions is to subvert, denature and accommodate revolt, not to encourage it.

Any monthly price change will influence the 12-month rate of change, as Poloz said, for the next year. If inflation were gauged on a year-over-year basis, i.e. so that the May 2017 inflation rate represented the percent change between the fiscal year June 2016-May 2017 as compared to the preceding fiscal year (June 2015-May 2016, any monthly price change would influence the year-over-year change for 23 consecutive months, almost double the period for the 12-month change.

0,"Early days yet, but BRFSS and YBRFSS data show no increase in adult or juvenile use in CO post-legalization.  FARS data shows no large increase in fatal accidents per miles driven or injury accidents per mile driven.  (See the earlier link I posted or Google for BRFSS and YBRFSS, and https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/ for vehicle accidents).  Basically, the available evidence suggests that the public health impact of legalized commercial sales in CO has been slight.  There's some evidence for increased ED admits for poisonings among young (0-8yrs) children, but the increase was in the early 2000's, after medical marijuana passed, not after commercial sales passed — and the trend is downward in recent years.  That all suggests that whatever the public health dangers related to MJ use might be, most of them were pretty close to fully realized before legalization.  If you've got a better analysis, please post a link (seriously, I'd like to see it!).

0,"Indeed, """"When It Comes To Native Hawaiian Affairs, Authoritarianism Is In Vogue.""""  The explanation is simple.  The powerful, wealthy race-based Hawaiian institutions want to create an Indian tribe.  And Indian tribes are notoriously authoritarian.  The chiefs rule the Indians.  Any Indian who doesn't like the way the chiefs treat him has no recourse to the courts (except the tribal court), because tribes have sovereignty.  If you make too much noise the chiefs will disenroll you.  OHA sometimes comes right out publicly and says OHA is not a state government agency -- it cannot be held accountable to procurement regulations or open-meeting laws, especially when spending """"trust"""" money instead of tax dollars.

The issue I have is that by going with Super-Hornets now (and they are quite different from the 30 year old F-18s even if they look similar), the Liberals are both not getting the best price for the first 18 aircraft and are essentially committing us to buy more Super-Hornets since you don't want to have to support multiple models of aircraft.  Maintenance and parts are expensive enough but you more than double your problems going with 2 different aircraft.  The next procurement round will be nothing but nonsense and wasted time.  AGAIN!  If you are going with Super-Hornets, just do it NOW.

Every step of the way successive governments going back to PET have deepened this relationship selling it to Canadians as being good for jobs and good for the economy.  The Harper Government was no less guilty. Canada bled close to 180,000 high paying manufacturing jobs during his tenure.  History has proven without a doubt that trade with China has decimated our middle class, especially that area of the middle class with its foundation in the manufacturing sector.  There is no question that we will see Trudeau rubber stamp free trade with China. It is a done deal. It has been bought and paid for by corrupt communist Party influencers in bed with the LPC.

I'm of the belief that the Democratic Party is big enough, wide enough, and strong enough to accommodate many views on this issue, unlike the Republican Party, which tolerates only one, firm absolute position. As many have said before, being pro-choice doesn't necessarily mean being pro-abortion. Speaking only for myself, I would like to see abortion remain a safe, legal medical procedure in order to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by pregnancy. Such cases may be rare, but they do happen, and the law should take them into account. The bishops may make no distinction between a fetus and a mother with a family, but I do, and I know how I would behave if I had to make a choice as a legal caregiver.

We have had minimum wage laws on the books for over 50 years and history has proven that an increase in the minimum wage has never resulted in economic growth or additional hiring.  In fact, quite the opposite is true, with each mandatory minimum wage increase there has always been hiring reductions and economic slowdowns accompanied by inflationary effects that actually reduce the value of the wages paid to the minimum wage earner.  We are currently enjoying economic growth primarily due to economic conditions improving after having eight years of stymied growth, and it is about time, but it has nothing to do with the raising of the minimum wage.

Trump said SOME of the protestors were just as bad, and they are. He was referring to Antifa who show up at every non-leftist event and physically assault people with their fists, bricks, rocks, bike locks, bear mace, etc. Youtube it. To say they aren't as bad as Nazis is a joke.  Hate is hate and it doesn't matter what group you represent. Antifa is much larger and has is a much bigger threat. There is TONS of video of Antifa attacking innocent people, cops, and even the media. Jake Tapper of CNN tweeted about Antifa media assaults in VA, last night. There is also photo documentation of Antifa people at the protest who switched their gear are pretending to be Nazis, while throwing up Nazi salutes. Those who keeps saying, NAZI are blind to reality and have an agenda to push, most of it just being anti-trump.

Canada, too, is a laggard where it comes to acknowledging and implementing international human rights treaties and conventions intended to protect the social and economic rights of people, including rights to housing, employment and income. Even though we've signed conventions that stipulate that these rights be realized and respected, our courts have said they have no legal effect unless specifically enacted into Canadian law, which governments in this country have had little or no interest in doing. We live in a corporatocracy, where the rights and interests of capital are paramount. If Broadbent thinks that pro-corporate trade deals can be made to be consistent with international law on human rights issues, I think he's missing the point, especially when Canadian law, which we theoretically control, doesn't do so.

That didn't happen overnight, and it took time for international institutions to be created to police those rules, but by the middle of the 20th century, it did.  The creation of Israel by Britain was one of the last cases of a colonial power deciding it had the right to give land to someone without regard for the existing population.  it is still a principle that creates controversy, as with all the separatist groups in the world claiming all they need is to win a referendum to separate, while the country they belong to refuses to accept that principle.

Furthermore, mathematical probability would contradict the theory that uninformed voters could not influence an outcome. Small or large pool...uninformed voters do and will influence voting, especially if uninformed voters, which includes misled voters, are encouraged and helped to the polls.

0,"Kaepernick is unemployed in part because he couldn't transition to a pocket passer. He was unlikely to be a starter again in the NFL but could have been a long tenured backup. However, he brings too much luggage and NFL teams don't want to deal with that for a backup QB.  I don't care that he knelt for the National Anthem, though I understand why that bothers people. Mostly, I just think he is a self-aggrandizing baffoon who doesn't know what he's talking about. He complained about oppression while wearing a Castro t-shirt and I don't think he was being intentionally ironic.  The free market has decided thus far that what Kaepernick brings to a team is outweighed by what he takes away. Maybe a team will be desperate enough to deal with his garbage and give him a chance to prove he still has worth as an NFL QB. Until then, I hope he works to make the world better.

As far as the CEU is concerned, how many US universities are to be found in Canada? The CEU (led by that paragon Canadian Ignatieff) is not an island within Hungary, not an embassy or a consulate, hence subject to Hungarian law.

His wife was driving the sedan. She survived but sustained multiple injuries. If the presented evidence is true then it appears that Jerome Barson’s wife was running a yellow or red light at a speed sufficient to result in fatal accident. Jerome Barson is suspected to be not wearing a seat belt while his wife was. The age of Mr Barson’s wife may have been a contributing factor.

1,"Any argument that prefixes Antonin Scalia with """"the great"""" rather than """"that idiotic moron"""" is pretty much on a downhill slope to """"getting everything wrong"""".  Hell, he wasn't even smart for his own overt bias. The man undermined the conservative movement more efficiently than any liberal jurist ever had... and he did it by accident.  I speak off course of his dissent in a 2008 gay rights case. The plaintiffs had argued that the surviving spouse of a legal same-sex marriage in one state has the right to continue claiming from his husband's state pension fund after moving to a state where that marriage was not legal or recognized. They won the case but Scalia wrote a writhing dissent arguing that it would lead to gay marriage being legalized across the nation - and outlining the exact set of cases that could allow this outcome to happen.  Inadvertently writing the textbook that led to Obergefell. Gay folks did EXACTLY what he advised them to do.

However, we do need to come to grips with the TFW program and overseas outsourcing where Canadian labour is not at all in short supply: call centers, network techs, database administration, program maintenance and so on, should not be given to either TFWs or outsourced overseas as we have good labour supply here.

What you are advocating is consistent with what the Alaska Constitution requires- and makes a heck of a lot more sense than imposing income taxes on working families in a recession.  Norway does not give away its oil like Alaska.  Norway started its permanent fund 20 years after Alaska did- but Norway has about 900 billion versus Alaska's 59 billion.  If we stop giving away our oil, Alaskans could be prosperous again, and we could be planning for a bright future. But this takes leadership.

I also don't agree with your assertion that it's not a """"small group of students""""...of course it is.  3,000 seniors represent 5% of the graduating class statewide which means 57000, or 95%, somehow managed to pass all graduation requirements so it can't be as awful as you make it out to be.

The designed purpose was that if the mainstream media an polls were repeated over and over, the election would be seen as a slam dunk forgone conclusion Ms. Clinton was going to win, thus many conservatives would think it doesn't matter if they vote, and discourage them from doing so. It does work, which is why the 98% of mainstream media that supported Ms. Clinton employed them daily. But as we saw, the polls and mainstream media, with some like CNN even helping Ms. Clinton cheat debates, could not be further from the truth. The mainstream allowed itself to be owned by one side, and thus skewered the presentation of the election and their projections. Who won? It backfired bigtime

You accept the relevant science and “know that [disinfection] kills harmful bacteria and viruses” and protects health, and you ignore the relevant science that shows fluoridation does exactly the same thing – although less dramatically.  You are ok with disinfection using chlorine (a chemical weapon) because you can remove the chlorine but not with the co-product HFSA even though that can be removed as well.

That's particularly true of the hard sciences. This under representation is due to self-selection, not discrimination. And it means Google attempting to have a 50/50 gender quota would require they hire basically any woman who applied, regardless of how talented they are in comparison with the horde of male applicants.

0,"I repeat--and don't cite one or two sensational incidents--what were Black people doing when they were shot by police? Don't worry.  Statistics are complicated, as this article indicates.  However, also read the dissenting comments.  Whether police are biased or just more alert in high-crime Black neighborhoods, that is changing.  Now the cry is to kill White people. Some say all White people in America must die so then Black people can control everything.  That's worked out really well in Zimbabwe. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/07/11/arent-more-white-people-than-black-people-killed-by-police-yes-but-no/?utm_term=.230e83499a62#comments

0,"Another prediction by the climate change crowd. We've been told about global warming/climate change, and what's going to happen to us, for thirty or more years, and nothing has happened we've been told would. SO NOW IT'S COFFEE.  How has coffee with stood the effects of climate change up until now?  It's interesting that NASA reports sea levels are falling, the ice at the poles is thicker, and instead of celebrating, the climate change crowd tells us coffee plants are in danger. So what is climate change really about? It can't be the plant, because every time there's good news about the planet regarding climate change, we get another extreme prediction cause by climate change.

0,"I personally think that what the four Cardinals are doing is very healthy for the future of a Church that respects the freedom of conscience.  Pope Francis is trying to help us all recognize the need for the Church and its ministers to respect the freedom of conscience of each of us before God.  The fact that four Cardinals have the courage to challenge the pope, opens us all up to the important experience of dialogue and personal discernment before God.  Until Pope Francis, dialogue had been shut out of the Church more or less since Vatican II, as part of the revision of the revision, in my view. Sincerely,   Dr Rosemary Eileen McHugh, MD, MSpir

If the LGBTQ-rights people are supporting the action by the cyclist policy, will they put pressure on other sport-related entities to change their ways for transgenders?

Silver doesn't care who uses what bathroom in Charlotte (no matter who the person """"feels"""" like) but Silver's massively sexist league continued its ways.  When you have a woman; a 101 percent woman; a woman who acts, talks and thinks like a woman; a woman who has the evidence she is a woman when you look down her pants - she can't play in the NBA. She has to play in the women's professional league.  Silver wants people included with equality and respect and no discrimination. But that's only for ticket buyers.

Too often, however, no such response is forthcoming. The slap-on-the-hand to the youngsters who destroyed Civic stadium (despite their seemingly benign motives) did little or nothing to help the community recover from its loss of property, security, and trust.  Even worse, it broadcast a message of warped compassion, suggesting strongly that youth somehow permits people to violate with impunity both the law and norms of civic decency.

In addition to that the Gov is not the one to make the final selection so are we talking about Galera applying as being the reason behind withholding funding or the lack of faith in those entrusted to make the final decision?  I followed this to see what kind of response ALL parties would receive and I noticed not one person on the BOE or DOE had anything bad to say about Galera or his commitment to the Public School System in Hawaii.

It did for two of the games.  But then they encountered the superior bats and pitching of the Jays.  The last game was an all out effort by both teams evenly matched- the pitching of both teams dominating the first six innings, the Yankees having a 2-0 lead taken into the critical innings.  And then Smoak ties it up- catching up to Judge in home runs.  The relief pitching closed down the Yankees which was the momentum change.  There was no way Donaldson was going to get shut out on his bobblehead day, and true to form, he hits the ball hard and the Jays seal the lead, and Osuna striking out the side of the top Yankee hitters.  A fantastic game.  The Jays remain in the thick of it with four months to go.

0,"Not wrong. One primary suggestion by Speer (and Crowley) is that an urban containment strategy - aka Greenbelt - is restricting supply. The Neptis report offers evidence that there is surplus supply.  So Speer would then need to provide analysis of what regulations are restricting development of surplus land. They don't.  The concluding paragraph by Neptis is suggesting that other factors beyond regulations are affecting demand. Not stated, by certainly implied, is demographics and changing lifestyle mean that more people want to live closer to the core. And the evidence of the condo boom in Toronto over the last 15 years would suggest developers responded by investing in the core and close to public transit lines - rather than develop outlying regions. A far more plausible explanation for slowing development of outer regions.  Bottom line, there is no need to dismantle the Greenbelt as it is not the key driver of rising home prices.

Then compare that to an equally equipped gas truck with the smallest, most fuel efficient engine. Chances are the gas truck will be cheaper over 10 yrs because of the higher price you need to spend on the hybrid. You still need to buy gas for the hybrid and have a custom electrical outlet wired to your home. The hybrid gas motor still needs oil/filter changes plus you've got the big cost of changing out the batteries at around 10 years or more likely sooner since it is cold in AK and the climate will be harder on the batteries than California. Finally you still have a compromise of a pick up because it can't go over 40 miles on pure electric so you are still burning gas on a road trip or driving to the valley or pretty much anywhere outside of the Anchorage bowl. If the truck is a slug power wise while on its hybrid motor than I don't feel you've gained anything.

But the fact that his toxic attitude toward women is what finally did him in should be at least slightly reassuring. It turned just enough people from “maybe Trump” to “Trump, no way.""""""""  --- I quote it as cautionary example. G&M moderators already BANISHED this quote once here today.

Now the US has  a incoming President who has no experience working in government  who thinks the best way to communicate is tweeting . For example his recent tweet on nuclear arms. Putin has Trump owing him big time for helping him win the election . I am very sad to see a great country like to US being run by an idiot like Trump.

0,"America can't win. Democrats want America to be like the rest of the world. Obama told us America wasn't an exceptional country, other countries see themselves as exceptional.  Governments of other countries pay for health care. Governments of other countries give their citizens more time off. But when governments of other countries enforce their immigration laws, and America patterns an immigration law similar to other countries, Canada and Australia, that is unfair.

0,"I read an article about Foucault today, it made me contemplate how much bad faith progressive intellectuals have about what is going on in Europe today, as their intellectual for-bearers were very clear about these kinds of things; Foucault certainly was. A section of the Muslim world, with the passive approval of its majority, has taken upon itself to Observe, Discipline and Punish non Muslim bodies and minds so that they obey Islamic religious codes as a matter of instinct, as a matter of habit. They are accomplishing this through spectacular random violence, enabled via modern networking technology and Muslim diaspora communities, especially in Europe.  The results are showing as European leaders, intellectual, political, spiritual and social have been reduced to docile bodies in the face of traditional Islamic theology - refusing of their own accord to depict or even speak about Mohammed, accommodating Halal and prayer requests in public spaces, in short submitting to Power.

0,"Of course it is a failure.  The RCMP identified the perpetrators in the majority of cases years ago.  We know  where the majority of these people went between victimization of prostitutes and murder by significant others .  We also know that murdered and missing indigenous men is probably even a greater disaster.  And we know that trying to maintain a subsidized semi-nomadic anti-capitalist male controlled culture inside a modern first world capitalist society leads to corruption, waste, hubris and desperation.  The Globe and Mail is partly responsible for creating unrealistic expectations in indigenous groups by raising the expectation that some mislabeled public investigation would have had in the first place.

0,"All politicians do that, though, and they have to. They're human. Plus, voters get extremely angry at politicians who visibly make decisions based on objective facts rather than how they feel, calling them 'out of touch', 'unfeeling', 'disconnected', or 'robotic'. Or even just calling them weak, when they don't act in anger.  I'd prefer we only had atheist prime ministers, but that's my bias showing. I recognize that sometimes the best candidate for the job will be religious, because having religious beliefs doesn't disqualify someone from any profession, and including religious people greatly expands the talent pool.  No one can represent all Canadians, that's why we have hundreds of MPs, and a role for the opposition party. I think Singh is more than capable of representing his base, regardless of their beliefs, though.

I agree that until recently prices have been consistent with economic factors, chiefly exceptionally low interest rates.  It's just in the last few months that stupid stuff has started to happen, and we are seeing prices that don't make sense. We are now entering a bubble: there aren't very many people who have paid stupid prices, and therefore the potential damage isn't yet very large. But, heaven help us if this continues for another year or more.  We have now had a decade during which the market has not been providing enough low-rise housing - that has permitted prices to rise.  Ultimately, we need more of a contribution from supply. The provincial government and municipalities need to recognize this.

Obviously, there would need to be some sort of limit on how much of a Doctor's time needs to be spent on things inside the system but having MRI machines being used to scan only dogs and cats at night because the Public care system can't use them then is obscene.

"
1,"It's become fashionable and extremely easy to come up  with anti Trump narratives and innuendos, """"Whether any of God’s children will be spared by Mr. Trump’s missile strike is anybody’s guess."""", never mind that """"God's children"""" already suffered the lost of their lives in chemical attacks by the Assad government. Ah, but it feels so progressive and hypocrite to feel morally superior by attacking the man who actually had the cojones of doing, what Obama couldn't and should've of done during 8 long years.

"
0,"That's very disturbing. On the other hand Russia have had a history of cannibalism due to meat shortage, many occurring in prison, and they had their share of serial killers, like Andrei Chikatilo. Anyone interested in that case should watch the movie """"Citizen X"""" the 1995 version, which accurately portrays the old Soviet style approach to these problems and how many lives that arrogance and ignorance cost.
"
0,"Since when is publicly disavowing people who advocate for a government system (Nazism) that caused the death of 60 or 70 million people supporting communism. False moral equivalence doesn't work here, either.
"
0,"Placing NATO troops in Latvia is a provocative act.  This is precisely how arms races and military buildups occur on bordering states.  Notice Russia's response was to move Iskander missile systems to Kaliningrad.  Moreover, if putting troops near your perceived enemies border is not a provocative act, as you suggest, why did America respond so aggressively to Russia's buildup in Cuba in the 1960's.  It is pure hypocrisy to suggest that when we move forces onto Russia's border it is defensive, but it is offensive for Russia to move forces near ours.  If we are to have an adult conversation about these developments in Europe, we have to regard actions on both sides equally and acknowledge that Russia feels threatened by NATO's encroachment into Eastern Europe.

0,"Hi, Dante.  Refugees: yeah.  Like most of the 1890s """"sheepskin coat"""" immigrants that were persuaded (hoodwinked is also a word some use) to settle in the prairies.  """"Wouldn't they go to protests nude?"""" They staged non-violent parades to protest government interference  in their lives--(education, for instance.) Why nude? They disrobed to simply get closer to God.  The """"break-away sect"""": the Sons of Freedom.  Yes, the Doukhobors were NOT a homogeneous lot, to put it mildly.  They also blew up a train car to kill a leader; torched their own homes and--in the most bizarre case of self-destruction--a huge and financially successful agricultural-food production center in a hamlet called Brilliant, outside Castlegar, B.C.  And it WAS brilliant--railway spur next to the massive jam factory allowed the Doukhobors to ship their products nationwide.  Entire trains full of the product from their own riverside orchards and gardens.  All burned to the ground by Doukhobor fanatics.

0,"And your bumbling, embarrassment of president continues to turn this great country into an oligarchy while his supporters prove he could shoot someone in the street and they'd still support him.
"
0,"Once again, that same gaping hole in the logic of the Vatican:  From Parolin:  Action must be taken to """"heal wounds, restore justice, prevent crimes"""" and establish a culture of """"real safeguarding""""...  All well and good.  But note the absence of accountability there.  Methinks that's NOT an accidental omission. So calls as to why the church is not considered a leader might start there.  Pretty basic stuff.  And when coupled with a history as bad as the church's is in this area, I think a LOT more will be needed before society, or even the church's own laity, will feel they can trust church leadership to do the right thing...
"
0,"Peaceful protests are fine anywhere, not """"as long as"""" any of your qualifiers. The """"employers"""" in this case, the NFL owners, support the players. So if they don't mind, it's no one else's business. If """"nobody cares"""" about the people whose intelligence you insulted, then why is the president mindlessly making it an issue and everyone talking about it? It doesn't matter what's in their """"job description,"""" they can do what they want without your permission.

0,"After 8 years of pissing and moaning I thought you guys might quit once the Trumpster took his throne. What's the deal? Are you going to cry and whine incessantly in perpetuity? Is it your hobby?
"
0,"So we give the corporate world free reign? Hasn't worked ...  I  just feel that more equal societies are more sustainable. How one reaches that is debatable, but pure capitalism has so far failed. Sustainable equality is not so much based on moral principles, but more pragmatic ones. People worldwide have reached levels where they will even react irrationally to the status quo, which is one of unsustainable inequality. Americans have voted in Trump as a reaction to the Democrats ignoring the working class for example. The unholy alliances between multinationals and governments  (read the space in which corruption thrives) are a natural result of our capitalist system. We are more likely to indebt future generations by making unsustainable nuclear deals than trying to balance equality.  On the other hand, a small nation like Finland has  the best public education system in the world, based on solid socialist principles, which gives everybody an equal opportunity to do whatever with.

0,"""""I was especially gratified by the number of people (and remember, nearly everyone present was in church leadership) who said to me, 'We need Adventist Today and Spectrum so much in this church.'”  I know many who have a somewhat different point of view, and that is that those two entities are often antagonistic to some of the pillars of our faith.  Or if they're not openly antagonistic, they publish numerous blogs and articles which disparage many of our beliefs, while rarely providing an alternative point of view.   IOW, it is not perceived as a """"fair and balanced"""" approach to issues facing the church.  After all, one would expect that an entity named """"Adventist Today,"""" would present a broad spectrum (no pun intended) of views on Adventist issues.

0,"Isn't that what I just said ? I was wrong on the 2nd weekend.  Just because my Character is questionable, does not make any of my statements untrue. As far as my commenting style, according to my Kidsports Coaching training, behavior like Brooks has demonstrated on multiple occasions this year would earn a play a ticket to the bench, or suspension for the year. Altman has allowed it, and not even criticized it all year, what am I supposed to think ? I have three boys all who like to play BBALL, this is a popular topic in my personal household this year, and I told them the same thing I told you. His behavior is childing, immature etc, and his coach should be ashamed for not speaking out on it....(which characterizes Altman's coaching tenure).

0,"I am a man, but I believe that the women (and men) who marched marched for all of us - men and women - who care about human rights and social justice. I saw nothing in these protests that was anti-men. The march was about a just and dignified life for all people.

0,"One wonders whether it was about timing or CR just grew a pair. Either way, it helps to note that he has realised that even if he were to lose, he would do so fighting to make things right. If he were to lose, it would mean that the ANC s more willing to protect and preserve its corrupt leaders than run an honest government that delivers services to all its citizens. That itself would help us wen we have to make that cross on the ballot paperin 2019.

0,"I have numbers of where I work and close to $2 million more a year is being collected from hourly employees for insurance and deductibles. This is just in Anchorage. Myself and many of my coworkers have fewer nights out and make fewer donations. I know $2 mil is a small amount but with money circulating in the state a few times before it leaves here that has to affect some people's jobs up here.

0,"As for HPHA, editorial board, look at their track record for handling development. 1 success: KPT. And they just fired that developer. Huh? HPHA = failure. Failure not just by private sector standards, or by public service ones. And failure specifically by their own standards - ask if they kept to their own schedule for developing Mayor Wright. Or School Street. No. Because they don't know what they're doing, and don't need to do anything. And so they have failed to shelter us. It is insanity that this is the agency charged with fashioning a public private partnership, as they have no expertise and their experience has been failure. The next time you editorialize about the benefits of public private partnership, do your homework first. Get specific instances where this has worked. Don't just play with your words, get facts. Real facts. Pls do an article on HPHA - it's history, it's past and present board, it's leadership. Check the record & compare it against HHFDC.
