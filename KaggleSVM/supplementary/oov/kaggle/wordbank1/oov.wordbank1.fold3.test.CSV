0,"MSW says that the Bishop's decree is """"so completely at odds with the direction Pope Francis is trying to take the church"""" - Can anyone tell me when Pope Francis changed Church teaching?  All persons in a state of sin - including those that Fr. Martin delineates- are supposed to refrain from presenting themselves for Communion...UNLESS they have sought reconciliation.  That has NOT changed, has it?  And that was mentioned by the Bishop - despite MSW's inference to the contrary.

0,"Whenever you see this fixation on the media - often it's described as the MSM - you can safely discount the argument, because it's the best example of a straw man argument you'll ever see.  You'll notice that those who are most vociferous in criticizing the MSM completely turn off their critical thinking skills when they read anti-Obama/pro-Trump stuff from places like Brietbart and Fox and Infowars and the like. Like sheep, they follow in lock-step anything that confirms their own bias without doing the hard work of thinking about what they've read. Because thinking is, well, hard.

0,"Mel, there are people out there, like whodat singer elsewhere on this thread, who take the time and effort to understand the policies of all parties and make their decision based on that rather than """"my family voted that way since Alexander Mackenzie"""" or """"he's got great hair"""".  We should applaud those who make their voting decisions based on research and understanding the issues.  Blind voting for legacy parties is a big reason why we're in the mess facing us today.

0,"I remember a time when all Americans would unite with their president, taking a stand against a hostile foreign power.

0,"Jane, neither you nor the reporters know exactly what Flynn said in his conversations.  All they have is what was told to them by Obama appointees, which they cannot name as it is a felony to disclose what they say was disclosed.

But I will not jump to conclusions based on """"unnamed officials"""".

Actually Mr. Trump's dishonesty is not a great secret.  His business dealings.....his four or five bankruptcies, carefully orchestrated to avoid paying legitimate debts....his misuse of Trump Foundation monies....his serial adultry....and, of course, his repeated lies during this Presidential campaign...... he's the highest profile """"world class"""" liar I know of.  Torture:  “What do you think about waterboarding?” Trump asked an Ohio crowd at a rally the night of the attack. “I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough.""""  That is a direct quotation from Mr. Trump speaking in July, 2016 at a campaign event in Ohio.""""  So it should be very clear that Mr. Trump does, in fact, support torture.  Mr. Trump's behavior has clearly testified to his dishonesty.  His own words are testimony to his willingness to torture.  Point out both facts is hardly """"rot.""""

0,"Sounds about right, I never was for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Hussein was bad, but it got much worse after we invaded and left. I think it was personal for GW Bush as Hussein had tried to have his dad assassinated. I doubt that war or any other would  have happened under almost any other politician, with the exception of Hillary Clinton.  She has more in common with Bush than Donald Trump. In fact Trump scolded Bush for his reckless   decision to invade  Iraq.  It was not a 'conservative' thing to do...

0,"Wonderful to hear about these types of projects. There are so many unsung heroes that are really doing something. Seems like the state should be able to actively support work like this, not just hear about yet another species lost. I would have liked to hear about how this type of work gets started. Sounds like a project that's really bottom-up, not dictated from the top by someone who heard there is a butterfly problem, but had no more knowledge than that. Hawaii should support good work by people that have the knowledge to really do the work! I remember hearing about this years ago, yet Will Haines only got 1/2 a year of project money? Sounds like he was running a rare animal zoo out of the goodness of his heart for a while, or was it the State's intention to release these butterflies all along?

0,"Abusers are sociopaths.  I spent time in college working an abuse hotline and have friends who have dealt with this.  You should always leave a man who abuses who.  Abusers are always """"sorry"""" after they beat you.  This is called a honeymoon phase.  They then get back to beating you.  I am sure some do turn around their lives, but the moment they touch their current spouse they lose them.  You file for divorce at that moment.  And I had walk away a few times because of my disgust at you.  No, women shouldn't have the return to an abusive spouse and """"bear"""" that cross.  They should NOT have to be abused again and again by such a man.  THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  Have I made myself clear? Abuse victims should divorce and forgive their spouses.  They should NEVER return to them.  And as a result of the divorce, they have the right to remarry.

0,"So there is something morally wrong with following the US tax code? So its immoral for me to claim my mortgage interest because it reduces my taxes? Its immoral to take tax deductions for child care expenses? What about capital gains and carry overs for losses? They are also in the tax code and are all used by average Americans.  In context, Trump commented that the US tax system had major problems and bragged he was able to avoid paying taxes because Congress and the Clinton, Bush an Obama administrations had never closed the gaps he used. He also noted that not only he, but the many very wealthy donors who bankrolled Clinton, if not Clinton herself all used those same loopholes!  Now for immoral tax loopholes, what about the millions who pay no taxes and are actually paid by the IRS using the Earned Income Credit?

0,"Look, the 97% figure came from a published paper, that was supported by other published papers (Doran, Oreskes).  Instead of calling me names, you'd be better off trying to think up some REASONS why it's not right.  Links to inane videos about The Petition Project (which proves that """"Yay, we got a bunch of people to sign our petition!"""") or more chaff from Roy Spencer don't cut it.  Here's an example from the Roy Spencer video:  Spencer: """"...the climate is not as sensitive to carbon in the atmosphere as MOST SCIENTISTS think it is.""""  So he agrees there's a consensus, even as he tries to minimize the importance of  the evidence.  That's some powerful debunking right there.

"
0,"Bankruptcies are not really important. That is a play the liberals are making to make Trump look bad. Trump operates in RE development. Every project has at least 2 legal companies, if not more. Sometimes bad investments happen (whether economic timing or missed projections) and when that does, those legal entities are left filing for bankruptcy. Have you ever made a bad investment? I know I have.  The difference between Trump and Hillary is Trump is running a business and investing economic projects. He is actively managing wealth through the investments he chooses.  Want to talk lawsuits? Those are also extremely common in real estate development. The fact that he has many is irrelevant. Bankruptcies and lawsuits are part of doing business in real estate development. Everyone, big or small runs across those issues at some point.  I'd rather have a president that knows how to manage debt leveraging to grow revenue, which is what RE development is.

Please build schools in communities where they are old and decrepit (been asking for this for over 30 years now). Please fund Native children to the same extent as non-native children in Canada. Have settlers uphold their treaty responsibilities (they never do....heck, most think that they have nothing to do with treaties).  Boy, I could keep going on, and I have said nothing about legal issues or land claims yet, since they are often the two items that settlers always say are unreasonable, and hence, left off your request.).

"
0,"As to the gist of your comment, Mr Obama had, during his first 2 yrs as a president, the entire Congress.  Even if ALL the Republicans stood up to vote no, they would have been defeated w/ simple majorities of Dems in both houses.  Why didn't the Democrats do something about it then?  Both houses of Congress, plus the """"phone and a pen"""" in chief and they didn't do anything about this issue.  Did this issue not exist (in their minds) back then?  No, it still did.  So your argument of """"us vs them"""" is moot.  When the left says, """"We need to have a discussion about [FITB]"""", what they really mean is """"Shut up.  Here's how its gonna go.""""  When the left says """"compromise"""", they mean """"do as I say, not as I do.""""  The Repuclican party has protected our 2nd Amendment.  The Democrats want to abolish it.  They've said so publicly.  And you know that.  Don't confuse activity w/ progress.

0,"He is not an illegal alien. He came to the US quite legally, and with the blessing of the US government in the early 1980's. His criminal conviction makes him now a legal alien subject to deportation, not illegal. Even so, he would not have been deported to Cuba (because it was Cuba) under the policies that existed throughout his childhood and up until a couple of years ago. And even now, Cuba may not take him.  Technically, yes, he was subject to deportation (still legal status), but he was released, and ICE apparently knew it, in 2008, and deportation was not instituted. The question becomes, is it justice to punish him more with a policy that is different from the rules he was subject to all his life until the Obama administration decided to make friends with Cuba.  The reason for the pardon is that if he does not have a violent crime conviction, he is, or should technically be, a legal alien NOT now subject to deportation.  And yes, there are arguments to be made both ways.

That lead was to effect regime change which Obama did not endorse, neither did the UN - just NATO off its leash.

Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike.

Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions.

0,"Conventional lawns have a high water cost, if they're to remain green. But plastic has an even higher one . . . maybe. That would be an interesting comparison to run. Most people also use gasoline powered tools to maintain their lawns too. Again, plastic too has a carbon footprint, but it's not a recurring one. This is another comparison that needs to be run.  And of course plastic doesn't capture CO2, whereas grass is a natural part of the carbon and hydrological cycles. Plastic grass would also cause more rain to run off into streets and sewers, whereas grass lawns soak it up, eventually it percolates down into the aquifer. But people fertilize lawns and that gets there too.  The best kind of residential landscaping would be indigenous, deep-rooted perennial grasses, shrubs and trees arranged in unconventional but natural-like formations. These would need no lawn mowers, little watering or fertilizer, but would capture and sequester CO2 and rain water.

0,"If you remember the voters did vote to move the capital many years ago, to Willow. How that was decided escapes my memory for now. Disregard that Anchorage already had most of the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the transition. Then Juneau politicians mandated that the new capitol would need to be a palatial expensive new city metropolis. (Or close to it.) The cost was insane so the mandate from voters was nixed, and legislators were able to stay in Juneau, on a spending spree like no other, lining their own pockets with pay raises and comfy retirement packages among other things, far from prying eyes. Is it any wonder that we face this budget crisis now, after the billions the state earned and then squandered on ridiculous mega projects, perks for politicians, and all sorts of wasteful ventures to numerous to mention. Is there anything a legislator has or does that the state doesn't pay for? Hooray for us the Elite Privileged Class!

1,"They weren't my friends.  They were the disgusting enemy, as was their selfishness, which most Americans still possess.  Nice try, scooter.  I'll outline this for you:  When I took my enlistment oath, the defining moment was defense of the Constitution.  If you don't know what the military oath is, look it up.  It's short and to the point.  When the President took his oath (almost said military but he's a draft dodger), the main point is defense and upholding the Constitution.  Look up the U.S. Code that defines treatment of the flag and especially the section on Respect.  The flag is a living thing (says so in the code).  When I took my oath and faced that flag, it said to me that it represents the Constitution, and that the strength of this country was to stand up in the face of its fears to allow freedom.  When those players kneel, right or wrong their timing, that flag is saying I stand for this.  That's the United States.  Not a bunch of fall in line flag waving sissies.

0,"Implementation of the 15% foreign buyers tax helped put the brakes on runaway prices here in metro Vancouver.  It achieved the desired effect, price for sf detached took a breather, probably due to less speculation that sold-in-one-day demand gives rise to.  But rather than give the market a chance to try and evolve, the Liberals have rolled back the tax.  They have now exempted students (even for courses as short as 6 months), and  instead of limiting them to the purchase of a place to live (like Australia) they have allowed unlimited  RE purchases.   Anyone with a work visa, or  contemplating PR status - no tax.  They refused to apply the tax universally, so places like Abbotsford (where deJong owns 7 properties) were exempted.

Where is Hugo Chavez when you need him?  Either tax the oil with a production tax per barrel, eliminate all tax credits or shut the pipe down. Alaskans are better served saving the oil than giving it away. If the oil companies do not live up to their leases, they can leave and the state can contract with any number of companies to produce our oil.

0,"Our Constitution requires the President to be a natural born citizen of the United States, but provides no specifics about how this is to be proven, thus leaving the matter to each state to decide. Each state's Secretary of State must follow that state's laws, if any, to make a reasonable determination that a candidate for President meets this requirement before placing them on the ballot. This must not be a politically motivated determination, but a factually determined one. The press and citizens play a part in bringing to light any factual concerns, and this was reasonably the case for Mr. Obama as he had provided only a short form birth certificate in 2008. In 2011 Mr. Trump called for the long form to be submitted. Three weeks later, Mr. Obama released the long form. Mr. Trump is not a """"birther"""" but has been a reasonable skeptic, and has now laid the matter to rest. Those who continue to criticize him for his concern do so out of naked political motivation.

I want to be clear in saying that I don't know Edgar and am not speculating one way or the other because at this point there are so many possible scenarios of what happened.  I just find it hard to believe that while he is waiting outside for police to arrive that he would have a reason to have his weapon visible.

It was interesting to agree with Cardinal Dolan on anything, but even he could see how off base Bannon was on immigration. Most Latinos, by the way, are not European (except the light skinned ones), but are mostly Native American. Imagine if Aztec people were given tribal rights. The southwest would never be the same.

At the time, the City had completed surveys for the first 3 phases and was getting ready to do phase 4 (urban HNL).  Based on the direction of the State, the City decided to start construction on phase 1 rather than wait the 4-5 months it would take to survey phase 4. I didn't like that decision at the time because that opened the door for potential legal challenges, but the City thought it would save time and money.  This led to the lawsuits that shut construction down for 18 months and led to tens of $millions in change orders.  Even worse, that delay held up inking contracts for phase 3 and 4, and during that 18 month period Honolulu's construction market exploded along with labor and materials costs.  I think that single decision probably set HART back 3-4 years & may end up costing $1-2 billion.

0,"No Baptist, Presbyterian, or atheist has also sued the Catholic Church for refusing to administer the Sacrament of Matrimony upon them, and religion IS a protected class. In fact, priests have also refused to marry two Catholics in their first marriage if they don't follow all the rules first.  I don't see this as an issue that needs """"compromise.""""  As long as the state confers certain legal rights and benefits (including tax) as well as the responsiblity of a legal contract upon married couples, then the state gets to define the terms of that contract, and who can enter into it.  But if a church raises marriage to the level of sacrament, then the church gets to define who can receive that sacrament in their church.  We don't get to make the rules for anyone but ourselves.

Aid organizations like World Vision and Samaritan's Purse were there with 100's of workers. Many, many stacks and pallets of supplies, food and water ready to go out. Soldiers in the streets with hand saws cutting trees down so that trucks can deliver materials to the citizens. Traffic on the highway near San Juan looked normal. Power is on to about half the country, gas stations are 60% open. A lot of progress in a few days. The humanitarian response was overwhelming, and would make any one proud. Every neighborhood was full of citizens, sitting on their porch, arms folded. No piles of debris that they had gathered up. Clutter undisturbed on their lawns. Just sitting waiting for someone else to help them. It reminded me of Katrina. Trump is 100% right, and the mayor is 100% lying. It is maddening that she would put politics over people.

He's just another upset and unhappy Clinton supporter who isn't interested in doing his job and telling the truth. He's using his credentials as cover for his partisan griping.  The fact is, mathematically speaking, 304 to 227 is a landslide. If the result was 270 to 261, then one could make the claim that it wasn't a landslide.

If we need to impose fees to use the trails, then so be it, everyone that uses it though pays, whether with a pet or not, and whether hiker, biker, trapper, skier or otherwise. The fact is we have a leash law for 1% of dog owners that feel they are not accountable, so why not a law for 1% of trappers that feel they are not accountable? Imposing fees alone is unlikely to curb the problem, we need a law that can be enforced, and then we need to enforce it.

For example, unlike NAFTA, CETA allows for ISDS claims in the financial services sector based on the vague foreign investor right to """"fair and equitable treatment"""", which has often been interpreted by ISDS arbitrators to require public compensation for general regulatory changes.

I would think this would constitute a bargaining chip.  That is, we could tax repatriated corporate profits from foreign owned companies at a much higher rate than profits retained in Canada.  This may induce the sale of some assets, increasing Canadian or favoured trading partner ownership, reducing the importation of goods, and creating jobs here.  The down side is some loss of efficiency and increase in consumer prices.  But that's the trade-off the US is making; why not do the same here?

I remind you that you never actually refuted my assertion that removing Kim Jong-un from the scene means we in the West will need to deal with his successor.  You've only declared that you think our issues with North Korea will be simply resolved, presumably because any successor will magically embrace Western ideals.

0,"Although many """"right wing"""" thinkers support guaranteed annual income policy. The economist Milton Friedman was an early advocate.  However, it is important to distinguish a Friedman type approach to alternatives. He essentially emphasized the elimination of all other forms of public support (e.g. social housing) on the belief that individuals with a minimal income through their decisions would ensure market competition and efficiency. All keeping with his utopian notion of freedom to choose. Of course, most of us recognize that if you have minimal income you are typically trapped in a take it or leave it situation with minimal purchasing power so the effects of market competition are significantly muted at the low end. Inflation for low quality rather than an increase in supply and quality. That has been the outcome of rent subsidies for housing.  And in Canada, Hugh Segal has been advocating for guaranteed annual income policy for decades. Not that the Conservatives listen to Hugh.

0,"Actually Anthropological study - Stephen Ray and about anyone in the Holy Land - knows that large stones were used to put someone to death. And, the woman caught in adultery was going to be stoned.  The fact of her being caught wasn't condemned by Jesus. For He did say to those who were without sin, cast the first stone Well, they were all sinners. For if they did stone her, and believed they were without sin, they would had been put in front of something like the Sanhedrin. Jesus founded a contradiction.  And since Confession has to do with he Examine of One's Conscience, it does have to do with """"being caught"""" in committing sin.

Certainly the Civil Rights Act represented a statement of morality.  ..a statement of what is """"right"""" and what is """"wrong"""" in terms of treating other people.  The issue of abortion is far less clear. Some see it as an immoral act which should be outlawed.  On the """"flip side"""", a majority of  Americans see it as a woman's decision..her Choice and a reflection of her own personal morality.  So the key issue really surrounds just how much freedom of personal morality does a society allow?

It is the most conservative that Progressives (for want of a better term) are always defending and presenting as representative of """"the Muslim Community"""", not the more liberal ones fighting against conservatives.. Why is it the Globe for example has two  hijabis writing columns about Muslims, and none of them ever come out clearly about their actual beliefs and behaviors in society, but always to defend the more conservative ones?  As for the """"fence"""", metaphorically speaking, my point is about the difference between strict legalism and insistence on 'rights"""", vs. the psychology of human relations. Ironically enough, many religions wisely insist on the priority of the latter over the former, in the interests of harmonious social relations...

This goes waaayyyy beyond just serving everyone that frequents your business. The far Left lumps ALL Christians into the same category as the Far-Right wackos. Just read back through the comments in the DP forums and you will see this true. The exact same people that condemn anyone that doesn't differentiate between radical Muslims and mainstream Muslims condemn all Christians equally for their beliefs. Just look at the vitriol spewed toward anyone that dares send their child to a private school. The Left immediately assumes that they MUST be doing it because they want their child going to a Religious school, even when when the school specializes in STEM, or serves the special needs community. It is said that hypocrisy is blind, and it is true. People are unable to recognize when they act in the exact manner as those they criticize.

We have to do the best we can, and create the best policies we can, with the information at our disposal. Philosophy takes care of ensuring that """"best we can"""" part, but it can't guarantee the """"information at our disposal"""" part.  Cows can fly Jersey's are cows. Therefore Jersey's can fly. Perfectly logical - but the conclusion is false because a premise was false.  Bats can fly. Bats are mammals. Therefore all mammals can fly. In this case both premises are true - but the conclusion is false, because I didn't follow the laws of logic properly. Specifically I am guilty of the composition/division fallacy - assuming that what's true of part of a set must be true of the whole set. If I remove the word 'all' then this is both logical and true - mammals can indeed fly (even if most can't).

No evil is greater than abortion.  For a Catholic to vote for a candidate who supports abortion, either (a) both candidates would have to be in favor of abortion on roughly an equal scale or (b) the candidate with the superior position on abortion would have to be a supporter of objective evils of a gravity and magnitude beyond that of 1 million yearly abortions.  What evil could be so grave as to constitute a proportionate reason to support a candidate who would preserve and protect abortion and extend it? Policies on welfare, national security, the war in Iraq, Social Security or taxes, do not provide a proportionate reason to vote for a pro-abortion candidate.

So on that note, if Trump is a """"10"""" on the disaster scale, Trudeau is a """"5"""" or a """"7"""", but a lot of that, is that Canada is fractionally prominent, compared to the USA, and it is much, much easier to bury a PM from the news cycle, than an """"executive"""" like a President.

0,"Sure there is a big difference between a spontaneous abortion and a planned abortion.  However my point is that some RCC Bishops are attempting to make their own rules about what is a spontaneous abortion and attempting to refuse a D & C until the Bishop is convinced it is a """"miscarriage."""" This is dangerous.  This is the call of a gynecologist and not that of an untrained bishop.  The next point is that a fetus is not a baby.  I know in common colloquialism many people call their unborn fetus's babies.  A fetus can not survive on its own until around 22 weeks gestation and in a very good neonatal ICU.  Few if any non University Catholic Hospitals have such good ICU's.  Once again the RCC does not do it share in supporting the born child in common society as it supports corporate greedy donors over struggling children.  You sir are using fake facts or factoids.  There is a problem in all large corporate news sources because they slant the news.  No one is worse than Fox and Breightbart.

0,"Dennism, we can agree that hate is bad; the problem is its definition.  It’s become commonplace in some circles cry ‘Hate!’ whenever confronted with a rationally based difference of opinion.  Most often ‘phobia’, ‘hate’  &‘bigotry’ are convenient devices to deflect honest critique & avoid self-examination.  They’re the verbal equivalent of putting one’s hands over one’s ears &singing loudly.  I’m puzzled by this: ‘Hate is an intrinsic disorder, to hate is to be intrinsically disordered.’  ‘Intrinsic’ means constitutive; disorder refers to a undesirable condition.  Are you saying that people who hate (whatever that means in your idiolect) are mentally ill?  Or are they ‘born that way’, & are only doing what God designed them to do?  I'm teasing you, of course, but I'm serious as well.  The author of this piece has a certain viewpoint (which I disagree with), based on certain premises (which I also disagree with).

America doesn't defend Europe in order to ideologically promote a free Europe, it spends money on defending Europe as an extension of US direct foreign policy against Russia.  America spends money on military defense in Europe to support American military dominance over Europe, a direct policy goal of the US ...which Europeans have grudgingly allowed since the end of WW2...out of necessity in the cold war period of Russian military threat and expansion, and now, in the post cold war period of a preference for social welfare expenditure over expenditure on a pan-European defense by Europeans.

You have to remember that outside of the Mediterranean region, the rest of Europe was uncivilized till about 600 years ago. Civilization began in the East, and for 5,500 years out of the 6000 years of civilized history, the East was ahead of the west. Chinese and Indian Empires had twice the wealth and population of Roman or Greek Empires (a point subtly ignored in western schools).  And that is why the rise of Asia is causing consternation in the west. It is not the rise of Asia, but the reemergence after two hundred years of colonialism, which impoverished Asia and Africa.

We IMPORTED most of what us manufacturing now uses in terms of statistical controls.  We have long ago lost our domination of advanced manufacturing, with both Asia and Germany in particular.

Your idea of leaving the price of the house the same fails when my neighbour who's been in the same house for 50 years pays taxes on a value of $25 000, while the house next door pays taxes on a value of $800k, yet both receive the same services.

People can buy an RV or popup trailer and call it a """"2nd home"""" and deduct interest on the loan.  No, I'm not making that up.  I'm guessing the 2nd home deduction is because many Congress members, at one time at least, had 2 homes, one in their district, one in DC.  But that's another topic for another day.  We just can't afford to subsidize high mortgages and high local taxes.  We don't subsidize the entire cost of sending kids to college - that tax credit is $2500.  We don't subsidize the entire cost of raising kids.  We don't subsidize all of people's healthcare costs (frankly, the amount we allow for that deduction is too low, imo). We limit how much people can shelter for retirement.  There are many areas that the tax code allows some deduction in order to encourage a particular activity, but not unlimited amounts for people to spend on that activity because they can afford it.

But can Ms Kendzior tone down the first year poli-sci style hyperbole....it's grating  Donald Trump is not Beelzebub, he is not a fascist and he is not a member of organized crime...he is a kleptocrat and a narcissist with no understanding of the workings of government and no inclination to learn. He is dangerous because he is clueless.

0,"Israel ended the occupation of Gaza in 2005. Since Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, terrorists have fired more than 11,000 rockets into Israel. Over 5 million Israelis are currently living under threat of rocket attacks. More than half a million Israelis have less than 60 seconds to find shelter after a rocket is launched from Gaza into Israel. To thwart these attacks, Israel has maintained control over Gaza's borders and airspace as necessary. The actions of the surrounding Arab countries, in particular in provoking the 1967 in which they got trounced, created a Palestinian problem for Israel which prior to that had resided with Jordan and Egypt, both of which particularly the former had maintained the Palestinians in refugee camps with the periodic slaughter. Currently, the Palestinians exist at the pleasure of the UN, without which they would be nothing but some squatters crouching on sand and rubble on the edge of the Jordan River, which they are in any event.

0,"Of course some women experience emotional and physical trauma, during and after abortions. I've never said otherwise. I was just noting that if this choice is presented as a ,matter of risk assessment, women run greater risk when they carry a pregnancy to term, and it is dishonest to suggest otherwise.  I am not willing to think of proven falsehoods as """"information."""" Nor can I admire organizations that dress volunteers up in lab-coats, to dispense such """"information""""  as though it were substantiated fact. Also, I do not think that any tactic that keeps an abortion from occurring  is by definition morally sound. These views often bring me into conflict with anti-abortion advocates.  I'm told some theologians have regarded lying as the most grave of the capital sins, because of the violence lies do to the pre-eminent human project of seeking Truth. Lying is like crapping in the cistern from which we all drink. If one can't fight without falsehood, the fight may not be well conceived.

0,"The climate has changed since 1979. Fire seasons are longer, summers hotter and drier, and there are more dead trees because pests don't die off in the warmers winters.  Too many years of unregulated timber harvests are one reason for the man-made climate change. Healthy forests are significant repositories, or """"carbon sinks"""", for atmospheric CO2. They store it in roots and trunks, balancing out what they give off in winter with what they take in during the summer.  A replanted tree plantation, no matter how well regulated by the logging industry, is not as effective as an actual forest in doing this, largely because of a forest's greater biodiversity.

From a practical standpoint, there is no difference between not firing someone for incompetence and making the firing process so complex and time-consuming that even the most motivated supervisor takes the pragmatic approach and decides that it is more work to fire someone than we would gain by replacing them.  But you are also spot-on with the standard approach to downsizing - the orders come from the top down, and no one ever fires themselves.  So the orders get passed down the chain of command until it reaches the bottom, and the lowest paid, lowest ranking folks who are doing the most ACTUAL work get canned.  Small wonder that there is a drop in productivity but no cost savings.  No one follows up and asks why the supervisor that was 100% committed when supervising 100 subordinates can claim he/she is still busy with half as many..

These have been awarded, not openly bid for. Because of ISIL and Russo/Turkish agreements many of the contracts have long term unresolved legal problems, foreign oil firms still employ few Iraqis, and local communities see no benefit from the international presence. The international companies persist in using foreign workers and security companies to maintain their production and just as Saddam favoured the Sunnis, Nouri al-Maliki favoured the Shias though he has now been replaced.

First, while Assad could have bailed out years ago under international protection, it's almost certain that tens of thousands of Alawites and many others would have been slaughtered by the Sunnis, and hundreds of thousands if not millions would have become refugees.  Why would that have been a better result?  From what I've read, ISIL started in Iraq as a reaction to crude discrimination against Sunnis by the Shiite government. From there it spread to Syria.  So it makes no sense to say that ISIL will only fade if Assad disappears. That's just a non sequitur.  Finally, the Libyan situation offers no parallel to Syria.  Neither Russia nor Iran had serious ambitions in Libya. The idea that the West would have had a free hand to oppose Assad militarily is just nonsense. it would have led to another war,  one dwarfing Iraq and Afghanistan.

The one thing that every leader needs - followers.  The bishop has that, the pastors have that.  Who else on that list has """"followers""""?  Maybe they do have, but they sign as academics, not leaders of some movement or cause.

Social engineering has taken a precedent over the basics of education due unto the manifestation of the ideology of  education, rather than the true education process itself.  The base of education has become, unfortunately, secondary unto the ideologically driven pathway of the power of the NEA and its own minions both within its administrations and unions.  There are good teachers, to be sure, but they hold no power, especially those that have not yet achieved tenure, as they are not allowed to make a difference, so as to break the status quo.  When teachers are once again allowed to teach truth, the status quo shall exist no longer, ideology be damned.

0,"Yes, those are great policies. Hopefully they all get implemented. The sooner the better.  Prices will rise but not greatly since suppliers will eat some of the cost to stay competitive.  Also some prices won't go up by much at all because manufacturers will start making the products in the US.  A lot of companies make a lot of money selling to the US market, so they won't abandon it just because some tariffs increased.

Looking in the Lewis and Short “Latin Dictionary” we see “substantialis” means “of or belonging to the essence or substance, essential, substantial”. “Trans” means “to put across”.  The Church believes, and teaches, that during the consecration the essence of the bread and wine become the Body and Blood of our Lord.  The only “how” the Church discusses is the command and power of God.  The Church treats other terminology - e.g., metousiosis, the change of inner reality - used by other communions as completely equivalent.

In addition to QB Dru Brown, we have a 1,000 yard rusher in Diocemy Saint Juste, along with 5 of the top 7 receivers from last year's squad returning on offense. Freshman WR Donovan Dalton should contribute right away and should lessen the impact of losing their top receiver Marcus Kemp. Another key position on offense that must be filled is at fullback with the loss of their leading scorer Steven Lakalaka. Enter freshman fullback Hekili Keliiliki, who has the size, strength, speed, skills and the smarts, he received scholarship offers from Stanford along with offers from Ivy League universities such as Harvard, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania and Columbia, to fill the shoes left by Lakalaka.

He has lied so often and so blatantly, and his followers have so persistently rejected the idea of objective truth, that no responsible citizen should believe a word he says unless it can be independently verified.

0,"Mr. White has a silly deficit fetish. The fact is that the current budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is about 2.4%, or roughly half of what it was during the Reagan/Bush years. Debt payment to GDP is also quite low, which is an important issue. The national debt relative to GDP did rise because of the GWB tax cuts and the two recessions that occurred during his terms, but has been trending down since the economy has begun recovering.  Speaking of recovery, it is abundantly clear that the major drag on the US economy is a demand deficit. Tax cuts for the wealthy, the GOP plan, won't stimulate demand. (I refer you to both Henry Ford and the Great Depression.) Substantial spending on infrastructure coupled with stabilizing the ACA and only partially paying for those with higher taxes on the top 5%, while borrowing the rest at historically low interest rates, can and will improve our economic situation. It's never going to be 1960 again owing to an aging nation, but growth is possible.

The bill retains the constitutionally mandated Electoral College and state control of elections, and uses the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes.

The US government has an increasing debt load, while having a declining GDP. My sources say, today, it takes $10 of debt to create $1 dollar of GDP. US debt is almost $20 trillion and requires debt servicing which is money that doesn't go to social services or the military budgets. It also means each of us is responsible for $61,365 of debt. If, interest rates go up that's more money sucked out of the economy to service new debt to keep the GDP from contracting further. Servicing debt causes a decline in the standard of living and tax increases. Have you noticed? Basing an economy on debt, like the US has been doing, is not sustainable.

The psychological ego was not well studied before the time of Freud.  If you are looking for authors of more recent repute you might look into the meaning described by Daniel Winnicott, and his descriptions of the childhood ego.  This man was both a pediatrician and a psychoanalyst.  Other good concepts about the Ego come from Melanie Klein, who started play therapy in child analysis.  One person that I have read extensively is Wilfred Bion's scholarly works about psychic structure.  All of these authors were alive and wrote in the past 100 years.

It's easy to point at mistakes without offering alternatives, or solutions. I think a primary problem has been the commercialization of the media, in which profits have a primary place at the decision table, followed by the collapse of that business model. Other problems are significant as well, such as very low media literacy in the U.S., https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-researchers-find-students-have-trouble-judging-credibility-information-online ... But at least mainstream media organizations typically follow ethical protocols and are responsible for the content they publish (or they correct mistakes). What do its partisan alternatives offer? Zero validity, because they are so wrapped up in """"winning"""" the argument, rather than dialectically seeking common ground and truth.

Illegal immigrants account for 37% of all inmates in federal prisons and 29% of inmates in California state prisons.  California legal residents who make over $250,000 per year pay 39.5% federal income tax, a state income tax of 10.3% to 13.3%,  7.65% FICA, a sales tax of 8.00% - 9.5% ,  a real estate tax of 0.082%  per $1000 annually, and county taxes as well, which are the highest in the nation.

I wondered how they could make such assertions about men in the workforce, when they don't actually work with any.  I work in engineering, so have a lot of experience working with a lot guys.  Lots of meetings, I'm the only woman in the room.  My experiences didn't sound at all like what they were saying.  My experience also tells me that arguing with women who work in female dominated professions about what it's actually like working with men is a losing battle.  It's like playing checkers with a chicken.  Eventually, the chicken gets mad & wipes all the pieces off the board.
"
0,"Another issue that has been ignored is the unfair or inequitable treatment of homeowners and other asset owners regarding income on capital gains. In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.

Subprime lending is to people who have low credit scores or other challenges, where the bank charges higher interest to make up for the higher default rate. Alternative lending is for people with an unrated credit score (immigrants) or perhaps a low credit score because of high credit usage, but also a high and proven cash flow, such as entrepreneurs.  You typically see higher rates of default with subprime of course, but the reason you don't with Home Capital is because they're simply not lending to subprime borrowers.

It is true that Canadian teens report that cannabis is easier to obtain than alcohol and that they are roughly twice as likely to try cannabis than try tobacco, but I think it would be difficult to argue that legal regulation results in lower youth usage rates and easier to make the case that the law makes no difference one way or the other. One can find examples of low usage rates in more prohibitionist jurisdictions as well.  Rather, usage rates, and more importantly problematic usage rates, are moderated by social customs and mores, education, treatment and harm reduction, and prohibition impedes and competes with these.

Meaningful comparisons would comprise current male-female pay rates in the same profession at a similar time in career.  No data given.  The comparison with other countries fails to examine the percentage of females working.  Likely those who do not work outside the home are not included in computing the average wage.  If working women in some countries comprise mostly professionals, they will rank better compared to men.  Based on what is not said, I conclude that the pay """"disparity"""" comes primarily from career choice rather than male-female pay differences in comparable jobs.  So I wonder, why do we want to manipulate women's career choices?  Paid maternity leave is really irrelevant in determining career choice and thus a red herring.  Why do we want to steer women into high stress long hour jobs instead of letting individuals make their own choices?  Nanny state.

0,"4-gamer coming up vs RSox @ Fenway.  Some otherwise not-very-well-informed Your Js fan was railing recently here how come Stroman hadn't pitched yet after the ASB.  Uh, well, you see, sir, teams set up their rotation a certain way so that they get certain match-ups, and Your Js were setting theirs up so that their best 2, Stroman and Happ, would start the series against RSox.  Or, they pitched their worst 2 starters, Liriano and Estrada vs Det so that they wouldn't hafta use both of them vs RSox.  Either/or.  So, It's Stroman, Happ, then Sanchez--after pitching him Friday in Det--in the 1st 3 games of the series.  And they want to give Sanchez some work, get him going, see how he's gonna do, so that's why he started the 1st game after ASB.  It all makes sense when you think 'bout it.

0,"We can foretell the success of the Trudeau government by looking to where most of the advisors come from, Ontario. The Wynne government is exceptionally unpopular due to rising taxes and ineffective management. Trudeau introduced policies which he claims are based on fact but are more left wing fake news.  Look at the carbon tax. Its purpose is to carbon being released into the environment But looking at the governments own website Canada's net carbon emissions are largely flat thanks to its forests. So why a carbon tax?  https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/report/disturbance/16552  Look at the popular """"tax the rich"""" tax increase. The notion of the 1% grew out of the American situation. How does Canada compare? Our 1% make about a third of what the American 1% are making.

Air conditioning at home or work and in cars which we find nearly universal was largely absent.  Food was more limited in scope with availability limited to natural seasons.

Then the Wall Street sharks will have to exclusively feed off each other, causing a unstoppable downward spiral in the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will experience an economic drop from the loss of the U.S. market, but will recover after that initial loss is replaced by other trade agreements and markets. Hopefully, the end result will be that the initial economic drop will be the last global economic problem caused by the U.S., as they were responsible for the 2007 recession, and more than their fair share of previous recessions.

It remains to be seen whether HPD has been enforcing the new requirements as they have been opposed to such measures before both the City Council and the state legislature.  Couple of their ridiculous excuses were that officers did not have noise meters and were not knowledge to determine if a moped had been illegally modified or not.

For one thing, today's best jets are only as fuel efficient as the last generation of piston-powered airliners of the late 1950s (when then there were far fewer people traveling by air). Also, aircraft have a long life-span and it takes decades for new technology to work its way into the fleet and have a marked effect on overall emissions. Even if that weren't so, growth in air travel is outpacing the technological improvements.  As you noted I know nothing about you other than your comment, which is why I used the preface """"it seems."""" And concerning offsets, they accomplish little more than making one feel good and are essentially pointless. There is much on the web about that.

Gun rights activists say provision protects rights of residents. January 06, 2002 http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/06/local/me-20649  Tony Knowles vetoed the 1998 bill that would have permitted psychotics to carry weapons. Republicans, mostly, overrode his veto. The gun owner who believed he had been poisoned with chemicals which he was trying to soak out, and who had a chip implanted in his head, was sent to API, then released. The permit cancellation case was appealed. Then-NRA vice president, Wayne Anthony Ross, successfully represented the disturbed gun packer to keep his permit.

Trump's changes are to still require whole grains in food, but at the 50% level instead of 100%, allow for 1% milk instead of fat free milk and allow for sodium totals that aren't as strict as before.  (http://tinyurl.com/ya8dor2b) The article states that kids have been eating less of the school lunch meals since Mrs. Obama's more restrictive program went into place and there is anecdotal evidence of that across the board.  One researcher is quoted as not agreeing with that assessment but she also admits the kids are throwing out fruits and vegetables but as long as they're eating some of them, that's better than nothing...which I kinda find funny.

When family values are not taking hold with our youth and we find that our young people do reprehensible things, and that individuals in a position of authority, such as parents or landlords, do nothing to deter such monstrous behavior amongst the humanity they oversee, we are up the river with no paddle.  Smug attitudes will simply be our downfall as a civilization.

Republican congressmen make this a self-fulfilling prophesy. Eliminate GOP control of Congress and it might just get things done like it did before the far-right took over the Republican party.  Of course that will likely mean tax increases on the top 10% from things like eliminating the social security payment cap, carried interest and the immorally low capital gains tax rate. Lincoln declared that labor is more important than capital as it precedes capital, but you wouldn't know that from our current relative tax treatment of the two.

That is, he must not believe the members and leadership of Imago Dei hate or mistreat women and they don't fear or mistreat homosexuals. What if this is actually true? The progressive community is now far too exclusive and refuses to hear the opinions and perspectives of people it disagrees with. Its group think. And...fear.  Let the man believe what he wants, and worship where he will.

A call went out and heavily armed supporters came to the ranchers defence. Outgunned, the police backed down and deescalated the situation.

I'll probably pay a little extra (like a match) and let them enroll in the state plan. Sounds like they would be enrolled anyway!  Like Outsider, my concerns would be more as a user of the plan. I have money in the state 529 college fund, and it is pretty apparent that hasn't been handled well (several switches of managers, maybe a lawsuit?). If the state awards the management of these funds to someone more interested in the fees and profit than the users, then all the workers suffer. But on the other, other hand, most of those workers would either have no savings, so less than optimal savings is still better, or they would be trying their own hand at the stock market with most not doing well either.

Since late 2015, an ATT is no longer required for transporting restricted firearms for certain activities, like attending a shooting range or gun club. My charges were never about me obtaining a firearm without a license, it was about whether a photo was taken under the right set of circumstances. I was arrested and put in jail for 56 days while denied bail even though I had no criminal record.

It would only take 11.5 years to pay us back.

0,"So what has the Alaskan Department of Fish and Game Commissioner gained from the death of this last male (who has a pregnant female waiting in the wings)?  Nothing I would assume expect the possible extinction of a particular line of wolf which 1000s of people will no longer visit Alaska to see.  Since when does a National Park allow """"thugs"""" (posing as hunters) to come into its park and kill animals - animals by the sounds of it that are moving towards extinction.  Even if these animals were in excess surely it's the responsibility of the parks board to sort it out and not leave it's borders open to hunters to sort out for them because hunters don't know how to discriminate between what needs to be culled vs what needs to be retained.  You're despicable MR COTTEN.  If YOU have the authority, close the park for the next few years so the wolves can recover - not just for an extra month a year - and do it immediately.

Control of the region assures dominance of the dollar, a dominance essential to the survival of the U.S. marred in deep debt. Degrade dollar hegemony and the debt blowup will make 2008 a firecracker. This is the single most important reason for playing such deadly geopolitical games by the U.S.  Second reason is strategic encirclement of Russia and China. Troops - yes, bases -yes, missiles - yes, create a mess for them - yes. But the biggest 'ammo' is to create Islamic terror uprising of epic proportions right on Russia southern border, on China western border. That's the strategy. When both China and Russia are 'contained' the U.S. can roam the world and continue with its plunder with impunity.  But this game assume Russia and China are stupid. The EU more stupid.

0,"I disagree, that such name-calling is the only way people argue for the welfare of immigrants. Some people try to make the case that it is Christian, in some obligatory sense, to give shelter and succor and all that. Or Godly and necessary with respect to some other religion. Or merely desirable, decent, and proper, in light of some secular-humanist understanding of how we ought to treat each-other.  The name-calling is often, I think, a clumsy attempt to imagine the motivations of people who hold different positions. Where opinions are starkly divided, the proponents of conflicting views, sadly, sometimes try to gain a semblance of victory through disparaging, and even mis-characterizing, their interlocutors. Sometimes such mis-characterization may be due to actual ignorance of the other view, and stem from a sincere misunderstanding. In such cases,  sustained and friendly discourse has the potential to widen our spheres of empathy and understanding.

Also: By 2018, federal employees who joined government before 2013 now have to contribute 11.65 per cent of their earnings above a certain threshold ($52,500 this year) compared to 8.6 per cent in 2012.

0,"A chaplain is valuable in traumatic times of grief. Some people aren't much for prayers, but when someone they know has passed or is in pain it is often a time for prayers. The chaplain is completely separate, they ask if the person would like them to pray with them, and often they wait until loved ones arrive on scene. Cops & EMS focus on the victims/incident. So what exactly are you referencing when you say """"Time to get rid of this much-abused program""""? Don't dismiss the purpose of a chaplain. When my daughter is surrounded by EMS and being loaded into the back of an ambulance, and I am terrified as I watch her little body convulse and eyes rolled back in ER head, I'm saying please God just let her be alright, I will gratefully take all the prayers in the world. I've spent hours in ICU rooms and just knowing that someone is there to pray and offer emotional suffer is very calming. A chaplain is experienced with death notifications where a psychologist is used in a clinical setting.

She's noted that one of the biggest single hurdles to resolving the current terrorism problem is that a large portion of the population in one community (which we're discouraged from identifying in Canada) too often rejects the concept of pluralism or liberalism. As a NY Times article, written by a Muslim author, recently noted, his own community often demands the benefits of pluralism without accepting that the concept entails an obligation of tolerance toward the broader society: """"Often Muslims support liberalism when it serves them and reject it when it does not."""" PM May has stated that Britain needs to have a frank discussion about this cultural disconnect.  Chilling shenanigans like M-103, which clearly intends to suppress such discussion, clearly aren't conducive to a healthy debate within a free and democratic society.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/opinion/is-free-speech-good-for-muslims.html?mcubz=1&_r=0

In these situations, it has been accepted that """"no bail"""" is not considered excessive bail. . imo bail should not be provided for an individual accused of new crimes that occurred while out on bail. I also think that denial of bail should be an additional consideration by grand jury during the indictment process for violent crimes. I think that their potential risk to society can be argued by looking at the heinousness of the crime and relationship to the victim(s) (likeliness to be a danger to the general public) as well as whether or not they clearly attempted to allude police when arrested. (likeliness they will appear in court).

She was appointed as Foreign Minister precisely because she can stand up to the Kremlin and, if necessary, to Trump. The Russians don't really know if the can trust Trump; he has no political experience, and by all indications, is too much of an egoist to learn much of anything. The Russian suggestion that they may lift sanctions against her travel to Russia suggests  that they may need an intelligent go-between because  Canada has always had privileged access to the American State Department.

Now, we are finding out Hollywood liberals hid Weinstein's problems for years.   To this day, liberal women's groups continue to deny that Bill is a sexual predator, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary.

That is why you barely saw a PSA that she made supposedly supporting victims of sexual abuse.  It is also why it was widely ridiculed.

You may wonder how the U.S. military could be """"depleted"""" when the U.S. spends more money than the combined spending of the next ten biggest military spending countries added together.  1. Part of the answer is that Congress sees military spending as a job creation program to spread work around the country.  The more expensive the weapons system, the more money that can be spread around the country for manufacturing jobs.  2. Part of the reason is that there are about four million veterans receiving disability payments.  3. Part of the reason is that countries who don't have as much money to spend (Russia and China for examples), have concentrated on relatively cheap defensive weapons like missiles and may have???  missile systems that are more advanced than the U.S.  4. Cheap development:  With all those U.S. factories over in China for example, it is easy to copy U.S. designs without spending money for development.  5. Potential for instability within the U.S.

The big ad spend is a sign of a marginal value proposition and poor differentiation. Until they have figured out a sustainable business model, don't think about margins or scaling.

The BC Liberals encouraged the sale of RE overseas by taking with them representatives from the development industry on all their trade missions.

In many people's view, if research is valuable then companies should do it and monetize their research. This is a clear example to the contrary (and I think there are many other great examples) of research performed by the World Health Organization.  Companies do not find 3rd world health problems a sufficient incentive (some do get federal funding to work in these areas). And yet, Ebola is a disease of sufficient virulence to be a possible national security threat. Government research acts when the capitalist market does not, for the betterment of all.

The ONLY way to put more money into the lowest earners pockets is to raise the basic exemption limit, as Quebec just did.  No Liberal will ever do that in Ontario though, since it reduces government revenues instead of increasing them.  The Liberals have zero interest in helping the citizens of Ontario, as they've proven by their constant increases in taxes to pay for their debacles.

As  our children started thinking about working we suggested first choice was the federal government, good pay, great benefits and gold platted pension. Unfortunately none work there today, so they are on there own. Our suggestions is  still 10% of gross pay is saved for future, this includes what ever the work plan is, (if there is one) matched to get the company max contribution, load up the TSFA as future savings and use RRSP only to get the max wrt house payment.  What I would recommend is that we enhance CPP so everybody who works in Canada contribute as if it was the company plan and would draw out the DB value (supplemented by gov if there is not enough money). All other company and gov plans are cancelled.

The only way we have any chance of getting anything remotely bipartisan is if Obamacare is repealed first.  Get back to square one and start over.  Even then, the odds are slim.

And because of the new reality for the Ducks this season, with unprecedented hype and expectations, Final Four talk, the S.I. cover, etc., they face more pressure than ever before. Altman has said he's concerned about the team not making enough progress on defense and offensive efficiency, and mentioned how much he misses Elgin Cook and Dwight Benjamin for their toughness and leadership.  It might serve the Ducks well to be dropped in the rankings to the mid teens and make them really work to get back into the top ten. The Maui Invitational will be a real test. But I think the Pac-12 title will still be a race between Oregon and Arizona.

0,"North Korea just called Trump's bluff like I thought they would by saying they are planning a missile attack on Guam. I do not think Trump will respond with action-- he will just keep raising the rhetoric-- maybe more specific reference to use of US Nuclear power. At some point, there will need to be either even clearer and stronger message from the USA, but it requires some action as well. Some actions we might take would be to move another carrier group in range to attack, and/or moving military dependents-- I think there are about 10,000-- and securing US troops there. If we start to do those things or things like it, it will also convince the Chinese to step up their diplomatic efforts. Actions to watch out for from Russia and China would be their providing anti-missile and anti-aircraft defenses to North Korea-- as long as they do not, it would signal to us that they support our moving toward a military solution.

On the one hand it seems to be acceptable and even fashionable to try to erase from our public space those symbols that represent people or practices of repression in our distant and not too distant history. As a society we appear to be attempting to sanitize our language and are even prepared to jail offenders who do not adhere to what the police of political correctness mandate as acceptable or not acceptable. Allegedly, we are doing this as a society because of what those symbols or historical persons or entities or hurtful language represent to some members of our society.  In other words a minority of people who object to playing by the new rules can be demonized, sanctioned or jailed for not conforming.  Why is it then acceptable and defensible to allow these articles of clothing that also represent oppression and tyranny the freedom to offend?

Analysts at this stage of a party's life should be dispassionate. If they were they would be forced to admit that, Kellie Leitch aside, very little talk among the candidates has been about Canadian values and everything connected to that subject.  The focus has been on the deficit, on taxation, and on foreign policy.  The Globe editorialized that only Michael Chong has argued for an inclusive politics, but in fact most candidates—especially O'Toole, Raitt, Saxton, and Alexander—have gone out of their way to disavow anything that smacks of being anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim, and in this respect are indistinguishable from politicians in the other parties. Most Conservatives do want to tread carefully where climate change is concerned, but that is because progressive talk is cheaper than progressive action.

But feminists (like Trudeau) defend it.  I don't get it. 2. If it's ok to veil yourself when you receive public services then I guess it's ok to veil yourself when you deliver public services, e.g. if you're an elementary school teacher. 3. I suppose for liberals it's ok too if men veil themselves, or wear masks or otherwise cover their faces/identities when receiving public services. 4. Mr Trudeau is not telling the truth when he says it's about telling women what to wear.  He knows no-one's telling women what to wear (I suppose women can wear nothing if they really want to), it's really about everyone revealing their face when receiving public services, but he deliberately misstates the point. 5. As this is all about Muslims, I guess we can drop the argument that veils are not religious, that they're cultural.

0,"Having dealt with a large amount of real world science hiring, I have not found that equally qualified applicants have faced gender discrimination in terms of wages.  There have been cases where women were not hired for gender issues, but if hiring is done, the wage is consistent with qualifications.  It was not me making the gender-based hiring decisions but I have seen it happen and usually the reason given that women are very sensitive and because of this sensitivity would make existing male employees uncomfortable.  Now regarding the market issue brought up by Mr. Boggs, I do find it quite persuasive except perhaps in very large companies where gender issues are put under a microscope by government agencies and such.  In smaller companies, employers would be crazy to hire a man at a higher rate than a woman of equal quality would demand.  I don't know any market force for ordinary workers that would discourage employers from hiring the cheaper of two equally qualified applicants.

0,"to Dave (continued) Our human understanding of what is 'true' – or what is 'reality' – grows as we grow - both individually and collectively. Probably most of the time what we understood to be true is contained in our growing understanding; sometimes not. And what we are capable of knowing NOW might need to change as we grow in capacity to understand.  I personally think that applies to us as a Church, also. There was a - very long - time when we considered slavery to be quite moral and OK. Gradually we came to realize that treating a person as property was morally evil. Right now we are being asked to change opinion on the morality of capital punishment. We have always used it and approved of it. But is it really moral?  So, yes, it is possible that new knowledge may contradict a former teaching and doctrine. Usually the Church has wisdom enough to explain why and how our knowledge grew. But that is what being a 'Church' is all about. We are all in this 'seeking wisdom' task together.

If you have VSB in a non registred account you will earn 2.17% and also have a capital loss because the bonds have been bough at a premium and the etf will get only their face values when the bonds mature.

One thing about him is that he has experience leading from a position of power. We must remember that those under him will be running the country mostly. No question he will galvanize his staff and cabinet. Will he galvanize them in the right direction? Trump may end up being a complete disaster for the country.

0,"There is no duplication.  CCSO and WASO have NO ability to exercise law enforcement authority (including conducting investigations) in Olympic NP because it is under exclusive FEDERAL jurisdiction.  If the rangers didn't do it, you would need another FEDERAL LE agency to do it.  This was how the park was set up in its founding legislation.  Short of having Congress change its jurisdiction by amending the original law, there is no other option.  The park does not provide MVA investigation training.  It is done during basic academy training at FLETC and the seasonal academies.  There is no cost savings to be had.  MVA investigations are somewhat tedious and time intensive, especially when injuries/deaths occur, but the taxpayer is paying for the officer's (in this case ranger's) salary regardless of whether they are doing SAR, law enforcement (including working an MVA), EMS (yes, they do that too), etc.

0,"Sherry, you do not know what you are talking about, with salaries.  Canadian doctors earn MORE MONEY in Canada than they would in America in many cases, such as medical-school affiliated psychiatrists and family doctors and, in many cases, community-based internal medicine doctors.  Maybe you are somehow unaware that plenty of USA doctors in America have actually moved to Canada over the years? And South African doctors, to Canada? And overseas nurses, to Canada? And overseas engineers, to Canada?  The world is the market and Canada makes full use of taking in foreigners who received tax-subsidized educations in their home countries (USA, India, Pakistan, Iran, South Africa, United Kingdom, etc).  Your demand for massive penalties, if adopted by all countries, would quickly shoot Canada in the foot, drying up the massive inflow of foreign expertise into Canada. You might want to go talk to the chiefs of staff at major Canadian hospitals etc before invoking such a crippling approach.

0,"I do not see any mention of the US paying the international price for Canada oil instead of the 50 cents on a dollar made up in the US price. So we export 3 million barrels a day to the US and the price will now be up 30 bucks a barrel. This means the US will pay Canada 90 000 000$ that is 90 million Dollars a day, or 560 million a week. This is the same for Canada Natural Gas where we currently get 25 cents on the international price and Canada is the second largest exporter on Natural gas in the world. Why are we not putting these stakes in the ground instead of selling s few cars of better worker rights in Mexico, These actions will enrich Canada, have no carbon impact and drive work to Canada that is currently done in the US.

Before someone points out that the MLB is international because it has teams in two countries, I'll rebut by saying that MLB and all other professional leagues are glorified house leagues. The team and players have no connections to the city in which the team/game is located. It's all just business. If Coke owned a team, they might as well just play the Cocoa Cola song or maybe each league should develop a corporate/league anthem to be played at all their events regardless of the actual venue.

0,"From the article: """"The NDP plan would also increase the general corporate income tax fund by a percentage point, bringing it to 12 per cent from 11 per cent."""" ===========  For what it's worth B.C. is expecting to bring $3,413M in corporate tax revenue for the current 2017/18 fiscal year with an 11% tax rate.  If one were to take a straight percent-to-percent increase from 11% to 12% that would raise revenues to $3,723, or an extra $310M.  However historical evidence from Canada and other countries suggests that actual revenue increase will be SUBSTANTIALLY lower, probably between 1/3rd and 1/2 that amount even without looking at secondary effects (eg. reduced personal income tax due to higher corporate tax).  So at best they're looking at about $150M/year in extra revenue here.  In reality, adding in the secondary effects, it is probably closer to $0 in extra revenue.

Obama said in the past few days that he trusts Comey and that there is no intent to disrupt the election.  This is Hilliary's fault, plain and simple and to blame Comey, the Russians or the Martian's is simply not taking responsibility for your action.

Under Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the numbers of immigrants increased dramatically as did refugees  and in response to the 1985 Singh decision provided for  an oral hearing in the refugee status determination process for persons legally or illegally in Canada.

Nixon and war criminal Kissinger have the blood of a couple million Asian people and the majority of 58,785 Americans on their hands. Eventually what ended the war was not Nixon, but G.I.'s who refused to fight it, choosing instead to frag their officers, or otherwise mutiny.  Nixon would have kept the war going forever. if he could. Same with Johnson. I hope they're sharing a particularly humid spot in Hell. We live under a one-party system -- the Corporate War Party. Which is why we have two women senators (D-Boeing) that have never seen a military appropriations bill they didn't like.  A pox on both parties. Hillary was as big a warmonger as Trump. War is good business. We've borrowed $7 trillion on your kids dime for the current ones, which are no closer to ending than they were 15 years ago when we started them.

0,"Regarding the WACH caribou in GMU23: Annual harvest by locals has been 14,000 to 16,0000 Caribou, while non-subsistence hunters take less than 3% of the total. New regulations stop all harvest of calves and harvest of cows by nonresidents. Subsistence limit is now 5 Caribou/DAY. Non-Subsidence limit is 1 Caribou/YEAR. The current estimate of 235,000 (same as it was in 2013) is only 3% less than the 1972 high of 242,000, which is well within the range of normal population fluctuation. It seems there is no logical, biological justification for eliminating the non-subsistent harvest of Caribou from the WACH. Eliminating all but subsistence users from harvesting WACH caribou will place an enormous, unnecessary burden on those whose livelihoods depend on fall Caribou hunting, as well as attendant businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and airlines.

On the other hand they are not beholden to every yahoo who want a podium. That's fair. I don't think there was a responsibility for Berkley to host Ann Coulter or Milo Yiannapoulos. However, when people take issue with political correctness on campus it is often because students are out of line.  Milo is a crook. But starting a riot over his coming to speak his mind is not democratic behavior. And Milo--strictly speaking--did not start the riot. Milo is a troll! But the students--or the outside anarchists who egged them on--started the riot. Students, faculty, all of us don't have to listen to Milo. Shouldn't! But we also shouldn't throw massive hissy fits as if his existence and his views merited a violent reaction.  The threat of coddled college students is overstated these days. However, the reaction some campuses have had reflects poorly on all students.

If one took a snapshot of all the inv. available for sale in late March, there was only 3 weeks of inventory available for sale across the GTA - something the greedy banks undeniably would have known as eventually their mortgage business would have dried up completely.

At the risk of oversimplyfing, the Gospel speaks to us in the setting of what is really going on in our life and calls us to grow and act. The rules tend to protect the good order and prerogatives of the institution and its management. We have to do what we believe the Gospel calls us to do. Today's Story of the Woman at the Well shows Jesus doing this. Francis says the church cannot be """"self-referential"""" and still serve the Gospel. It has to go out and know real life as the folks live it. Management is not doing this now, but questioners are.  Of course all of this is based on a prayer life of some sort that leads us to be open to the Spirit in everything. Again IMHO, the fact that so many are questioning the church system these days shows the Spirit is doing things.

It has no hard-and-fast emission-reduction targets: Governments set their own targets based on what they think they can get away with with voters or what they think they have to give up to shut up the environmental lobby (which is huge and extremely well-funded) and its media pals.  For instance, in Paris, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed Canada to reducing its emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.  There is no way for us to do that without crippling our economy and putting millions out of work. That kind of emissions cut would require the equivalent of parking every car, truck, airplane, bus and train in the country – permanently – or shutting down every factory and non-nuclear power plant.  The hysterical reaction to Trump’s move, though, shows how much more importance “progressives” place on appearances over of results.

I've never understood why christians feel the need to proselytize and convert. They've found something great that satisfies their soul; why is it so important that I share in it? In other words, leave me alone. And in this case, leave the Assembly to pursue good government without this wholly unnecessary and illegal distraction.

0,"Actually, the dismantling of the ACA does not fulfill Donald Trump's campaign promise. He stated over and over again that he was going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something much better, much better and much cheaper. At no time did he say he was just going to undo it and toss millions of Americans into the ranks of the uninsured, which will certainly kill tens of thousands per year.  Once again, we have Trump lying to the American people. In fairness, this lie came out of his complete ignorance of health care policy (and a lot more). He wasn't helped by seven years of Republican lies about how health care access works. The reason the GOP had no alternative to Obamacare is because the only way to cover more Americans for less money is with single-payer, a non-starter for the GOP.  But that's all water under the bridge. Colin Powell's Pottery Barn Rule applies here: the GOP, especially Trump, broke health care access in America so they now own it.

0,"Thank you, Nathan as this issue is critical for individuals leaving acute care and are in need of placement.  Often times acute hospitals are rushed to transfer to whatever vacancy is available, which makes these OHCA reports critical.  You may want to check into training for these nursing positions.  It is not just a matter of taking any nurse off the street to do these reviews.  These nurses must know the rules and regulations (both state and federal) and are extensively trained and tested.  This is extremely important because when  one cites for violations...you need to know what rules and regs are pertinent, as well as be knowledgeable when any number of issues are amiss.  There are other health experts as well; e.g., social work, dietary.  The staff also travels to neighbor islands for reviews.  It would be important to see if staff have laptops, look at turn-around time for posting completed reports on-line, and give immediate on-line quick initial reports.

0,"Joan: It is indeed past time for the laity to become more involved with how the Church is run. It is past time for the patriarchal /monarchial system to be overturned. The question becomes how to get this done. Can it be done from the inside? Is that even possible? Can we expect those on the inside with all the power to voluntarily give up even a little bit of that power? Historically, that has rarely if ever happened. Myself, I have given up on the idea that change will ever come about from within. If change is to happen, it must happen from sources outside the Church. Most of the changes that have occurred within the last thirty years have come from outside the Church. The lawsuits against the Church, the changes in Statutes of Limitations, the work of organizations like SNAP have moved the needle very slightly. Even today with the very little that Francis has accomplished, there are calls on the right for his resignation. The Catholic Church has changed very little in its' history.

Each layer of profit simply pushes the cost as high as it can possibly be.   Only because of the inordinate influence corporations have through campaign donations are we the last developed country who provides medical care under a for profit system.    People rarely elect to get sick or injured, so it's an inappropriate market for free capitalism.   Would you rather pay a 3% medicaid tax to have full coverage for your family, or the present family insurance rate you pay now?   Britain, Canada, and others provide coverage to their people for about 3%.   And, they do it at a fraction of the cost that we do, with better outcomes.   A private health insurance model for health care delivery is a failure to all but the shareholders who profit off the illness and suffering of others.

I believe if viewership pools were taken when games start and again at half time there would be a dramatic decrease during half time because that is when many viewers head for the toilets, restock the beer coolers or cook a few burgers on a grill.  The NFL would save lots of money and get lots of good PR if it was to audition amateur or unknown professional entertainers from around the country during the regular season and select one or more of them to get some big-time exposure by perform at half time during the Super Bowl.

The bill was crafted in secrecy. Why were Republicans not using the public committee process to draft the repeal and replace?

The problem is that the alternative is that we have unelected and unaccountable judges meddling in church affairs--deciding when bishops may dismiss employees whose behavior might be a cause for scandal.  You might think that is a good idea.  It isn't.  This is because rights are enjoyed by everyone.  If a bishop cannot fire an employee who married his gay lover, than a bishop cannot remove a priest from ministry who frequents a gentlemen's club.  Just as there is nothing illegal about gay behavior, there is nothing illegal about visiting a gentlemen's club.  If bishops, then must tolerate immorality when it involves a gay couple, they must tolerate it when it involves a priest for the exact same reason.  (Assuming laws were not broken.)

0,"DD,  People who have encounters with Jesus can't keep quiet about it. Remember the Samaritan woman at the well? She couldn't keep quiet and when He returned, she brought the whole village with her. Remember the demoniac who was living in the cemetery and even breaking the chains people put on him to restrain him, and who was cleansed by Jesus? When Jesus returned, the man brought the entire village out to meet Him and hear His teaching.  Yes, what God teaches us in scripture is the foundation for what we believe and teach, but it is our testimony that gets attention first and draws people into wanting to know more about God. Having a testimony is proof positive that a person has had an encounter with Jesus and the absence of one is proof they haven't. So when a person can't share even a tidbit of a testimony, that is clear evidence the power of God is not in them, not even if they are quoting scripture.

There is a lot of truth to the lyrics in the “Ballard of the Green Beret,” which says “One hundred men we’ll test today, but only three win the Green Beret.”  Sgt. Johnson was one of the best.  Fourth, he most likely volunteered to go on the mission to Niger, which is typical for most Special Forces soldiers.  I am commenting from personal experience as a Special Forces A-Team commander in Vietnam, as Chief of U.S. Army Special Forces recruitment in 1965 and 1966, and as personnel management officer of the U.S. Special Forces Training Group who decided the specialties in which volunteers were trained.

0,"My suspicion is that he has a few trusted advisors, lay and priests, to help him keep up with the many issues he feels compelled to rule on.   The world is big, wide, complex and bishops don't have personal experience in looking at what parents would look for in groups that can help their kids.  Unfortunately, those chosen advisors are not also chosen by all the lay people to present different views to the bishop.  So, if he choses who to listen to, and doesn't seek widely, yes, he is apt to get led around by the nose.  I don't mean to imply that he is not responsible for the decisions he ends up making or to excuse his poor decisions or to say that those who advise him are the bad guys.  He is responsible.  Like you, I suspect pelvic issues, especially when it comes to women, are a primary concern.  After all, what does his training and experience lead him to expect of women?

0,"I'm a bit late to this discussion, but I'd like to make several observations.  First, there is too much ad hominem stuff in Gallagher's writing and in this set of comments.  Second, whether or not you embrace Cardinal Bernardin's consistent ethic of life, might we all agree that everyone who is pro-life is anti-abortion, but not everyone who is anti-abortion is pro-life?  And might we all agree that everyone who is pro-life is anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia, but not everyone who is anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia is pro-life?  But how about anti-capital punishment...anti-artificial birth control...?  And  farther down the path:  pro-gun control...pro-healthcare for everyone...pro-environmental regulation?  I'm a pretty simple thinker, so it seems to me that a consistent ethic of life would be a very helpful construct.  And that leads me to imagine that we ought to value life in a way that would lead us to oppose all those human activities that threaten innocent human life.

Over 90% of the literature I reviewed on crime prevention recommended quality child care as a viable strategy to reduce crime and studies have shown massive cost savings in the criminal justice system when kids are attended to in the right ways. Effective social policies offer multiple win-win-win scenarios across sectors which offer huge benefits and reduced costs in the long-term and this could reduce the need to fund expensive CVE programs to target adult outliers. In the scenario I present, the community would identify and address outliers in advance of any CVE program.

0,"I'd buy into the 'Vancouver area prices will drop a lot' hypothesis if there was an alternative, i.e. widely available, reasonably priced rentals. Looking at my assessment, I'm sorely tempted to sell and lock in a big gain, but alas, I have two unrepentant smokers in the household.  In earlier times, landlords anxious to rent would look the other way, but nowadays - forget it.  Try and find even a single rental that accepts smokers. Landlords don't need to take the risk with tenants lined up outside to view the place.  The same is true to a lesser degree for prospective tenants with pets, weak employment histories ( i.e, self employed) or maybe on welfare at the low end. Conclusion: home prices will hold or rise over the next few years. A big recession, a serious overbuilding boom or large reduction in immigration are about the only things that will change that situation, and none seem likely.  Interest rates aren't going anywhere until inflation rises first. Rules changes? Not much.

I certainly never had a problem and never had an application turned down or sent back. The big problem Canada has in hiring highly qualified people at the top of their field from abroad is a low Canadian dollar, weather, and distance from the rest of the world, not immigration rules. (I am not talking about low level tech people here.)

0,"Taxing the rich and corporations always hurts the rest of us. Blah, blah, blah. Unless you're a CEO or major stockholder in one of these concerns, the vote is easy: make these guys pay more. As it is, they pay next to nothing. American corporate rates are high, yes, but what they actually pay is very low, compared to all other developed nations. Note the key: actually pay. The corporate tax situation mirrors our private one: many deductions, many crafted specifically for specific corporate masters. Time for OR to return to decent school funding such as the current gray hairs experienced. No more divisiveness! Every time a minimum wage hike occurs, many scream it will collapse the economy. Nope. The US continues on, the world's greatest economy. The problem is exactly what this measure would address: we've crossed over to too little taxation, to the point our infrastructure and schools are becoming 3rd world.

The stories would be disproven, but the damage had been done.  Now, in a neat trick,  the term Fake News has been re-purposed by the right. They use it to question the legitimacy of stories that are damaging to their narrative. It's a perfect example of the post-truth environment we now inhabit.

Nothing says, I hate you, in Christianity, more than watching a parish needlessly close because the women God called to be ordained and lead those parishes are deemed obviously too unworthy and unsacred to be allowed to keep them alive, or even cause them to grow and gain more Christian souls to the fold and to God.  Married priests are not a bad idea, as long as they only come, after women being ordained priests, without any restriction to becoming Bishops, Cardinals and Popes.  Ordaining only married men to priesthood would be an extreme sin against Justice who is God and the Human Dignity of all women, as it would represent outright Gender Segregation in our church, giving all authority and sacred powers to all men over all women.

0,"You didn't answer my question. Independent of your personal opinion of Comey do you think a president should fire the person investigating them for admittedly investigating them?  If Hillary had won and the email investigation was ongoing and she fired him would you shrug?  You seem to be just as partisan as you are claiming me to be.  The Manning kid served 7 years.  Obama didn't pardon her before sentencing without consulting anyone.  Nor was it a signal to anyone that he might pardon them as has been speculated about Trump's pardon of Arpaio and those being investigated re: Russia. I don't have a problem with usage of the pardon power when it can be justified.  Pardoning a political ally b/c he was """"doing his job"""" is not the framers' intention.

0,"I shall reply to my own post for clarification  .-) I am an equal opportunity critic, liking neither the Clinton version nor Trump's of how to get elected. If you had followed my posts you will realize that my overarching criticism is with voters closely followed by the media. The candidates as such and their political positions are self evident and not news, the usual celebrity flacks. The voters expect everything for """"free"""" and the media chase after headline potential and the related propaganda. The ultimate issue is that the USA is something like $20 Trillion in debt  - all of it borowed to buy votes ( keeping it simple - like Ontariowe ). The details really don't matter and merely serve to obscure and divert a fundamental issue and flaw in our practice of democracy and governance. On the topic of Trump - nobody pointed a gun at the voter's heads, he merely spouted the usual political promise BS thus garnering more publicity from the MSM  than Clinton, and we know the outcome.

I said clearly that the first step is massive evacuation of South Korea, including the cities you name. Casualties are low when your enemy bombs your cities that have been previously emptied of people.  2. If China refuses to cooperate with the US invasion, then the US ought to move forward and invade on its own. And you can bet that China will become suddenly cooperative when they see South Korea being evacuated and US military assets arriving in the theater of operations.  3. You raise, vaguely, what North Korea might do with the atom bombs it presently has. And I say, take the risk. Using conventional weapons, bomb every suspicious item en masse. If North Korea does decide to use an atom bomb, so be it. It has happened twice in world history already. There is no need to nuke them back. Just take them out, already.

Instead, it's cause by the booming economy which prices some citizens out of the housing market.  Yet you then immediately identify vulnerable populations as those affected by poverty (employment), low educational levels, and substance abuse (which certainly contributes to changes in family composition).  The rest of the article then talks about what your org and others are doing in those areas.

We can think the answer is clear, but if it were clear, why is there this obvious deep disagreement?  In any case, I can't help but be curious how many Catholics side with Burke + 3 over Francis.  Since there are only 4 who have stood up against the Holy See, then the answer seems obvious.  But I suspect (from purely impressionistic readings of Catholic media) that a great many Western Catholics side with the 4 over Francis.

OHA's resources is better spent on sustaining governance of self using education, protecting the aina and economic sustainability so that the ohana and communities can thrive.  Though OHA has spent time, energy and monies on various health initiatives, and most recently obesity (core of illness), perhaps addressing education (beyond high school) is a way of addressing our health maladies along with protecting our aina.  Affordable housing (so multiple jobs by 1 person) and economic opportunities will also improve health.  No need to spend $ on improving OHA's image.  Just remove nation building as a core activity, and spend energies on sustaining people in the communities they live in.

When the Republican dropped out FusionGPS found Demnocrats with deeper pockets and he hooked up with Steele, who'd already started on his own, and that's when the only things that have been talked about got in the dossier.

You owe me an apology, but I don't expect one.  I agree that every president certainly has the authority (mandate) to make change.  However, there is a huge difference between Trump's extraordinarily weak mandate and the robust mandates of past presidents, such as Johnson's when he thumped Goldwater in '64 and Reagan's when he crushed Carter in '80.

That is nearly $300 million more than expected and comes despite the government having resource and investment income more than $3 billion higher than Finance Minister Joe Ceci predicted in his budget in April 2016. - Put  another way: The New Democrats received income last year from oil, gas and investments that was $3.3 billion higher than they and still they ran a deficit larger than planned. - NDP increases in personal and corporate income tax rates actually reduced the amount of tax collected. Personal income tax paid was off eight per cent and corporate taxes off nearly 15 per cent. - The NDP theory that if squeezing the golden goose produces more revenue, then wringing its neck will produce even more has proven to be incorrect. When taxes are raised substantially, revenues often fall off as individuals and corporations move investments elsewhere. - Lorne Gunter Edmonton Sun June 30/17

0,"To suggest that TWU as a 'private institution' is free to discriminate contrary to protected human rights is absurd. Were that the case any private institution offering services to the public, accepting government funding, employing staff, etc. could discriminate against anyone based on race, religion, nationality, colour, etc. If they can ignore human rights laws, then it follows that, regardless of the reasons, they could freely ignore any other laws such as employment standards. health and safety act, environmental laws... why not the criminal code? Obviously, they can't. Your argument doesn't hold water in the face of reality.  Furthermore, nobody is suggesting that institutions don't have rights - clearly they do. But rights, religious rights included, are limited - not absolute. Institutions operating in the public domain (as TWU does) are not entitled to discriminate against individuals in defiance of human rights legislation. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada says so.

0,"I repeat an observation and a question that I have asked many times before, and never received a reasoned answer to. Marijuana has been popular among teenagers in Canada and the US  for about 50 years. If it caused brain damage in teenage users, we should be seeing the effect in all age groups up to about 65. Where are the hordes of people suffering from brain damage due to teenage pot smoking?  By the same token, where are the hordes of dead and maimed people resulting from the carnage caused by stoned drivers? Where is there ANY visible indication that marijuana causes widespread harm? It's easy to point to the smokers with lung cancer, emphysema and COPD. It's easy to point to long-term alcoholics with cirrhosis of the liver, damaged brains, and motor control issues. I don't see clearly damaged pot smokers, outside of anti-drug commercials.

0,"Good grief Ms. Koestler, once again the governor sent a balanced set of proposals to the Legislature that would have darn near erased the deficit but the only part of that plan the legislature has had the courage to take on is the PFD restructuring part while leaving out the repeal of the oil industry subsidies, the income/sales tax and the increased taxes on mining and fishing. If you have taken the time to work the computer simulation set up by the state you will find, as most of the people did who took the time to run the numbers, that the solution to our budget dilemna is quite close to that entire package proposed many months ago by the Governor. What's very clear to me is that there is a concerted campaign to blame the lack of creative, constructive effort by the legislature entirely on the Governor. The legislature refused to look at any part of his plan except the restructuring  of the PFD which is a non-starter. Most people want the oil subsidies repealed before anything else.

There is a very old debate in the Church about whether people who made deathbed confessions were saved, or whether one had to have lived a converted life for a period of time that manifested one's commitment to Christ. There was also a longstanding debate about whether one could be saved by good works, even if one deviated from the """"true faith."""" This led to some suspicion about people who were """"fast-tracked"""" to sainthood through martyrdom precisely because the details of their former lives were either not known or not known to have been virtuous. If you know books like """"Butler's Lives of the Saints,"""" you will recall that the medieval idea of sanctity emphasized extraordinary virtue and lifelong self-abnegation, as opposed to good works. So the question raised over the centuries was whether people whose lives didn't conform to church teaching could be saints.

For instance, the proposed turn from fossil based fuels is not back to wood, but rather to new, emerging, not-yet perfected sustainable energy.  And those """"who rebel against the Church returning to its former state"""" in fact argue that we should pay full attention to our entire past, not just the last 500 years. For instance, the post-V2 liturgical reform is in fact built on a detailed understanding of our 2000 year old liturgical tradition.  There is a common denominator. Both of the stances you mock are utterly determined to base modern human decision on deep scholarship of  our past. Both are engaged in a war with those who prefer not to argue on the basis of  developments over time.  But nice try--""""true"""" irony can be instructive.

0,"The minority voters that need to be suppressed are the dead Democrats voting, the non-citizens voting, and those who vote more than once. Allowing voter fraud actually suppresses the vote of honest citizens by diluting the value of their vote. Democrats seem to be very tolerant of voter fraud since they don't even want it to be brought out into the open. Secrecy is the hallmark of totalitarian governments. Openness is the quest of a true democratic republican form of government.

For my spouse and I (with a combined income of over $42k), we are looking at just over a 10% increase next year to $1800.  At 42k that's 4.3% of an already low income. And  not even tax deductible. Add that to the monthly premiums paid for  extended healthcare (for partial coverage for prescription, optical, physio et al) and low income earners  can end up paying 10% of their income for medical insurance.  Note that BC rolled back an additional 4% increase to premiums for 2016 due to this being an election year.  No doubt that will be nicely tacked on come 2018 if the BC Liberals are re-elected.

0,"My first response to your comment was an Unholy fusillade of absolute venom. Unfortunately, 'Civil Comments' doesn't allow for a TRUE expression of my opinion concerning your comment, as the accusation of a 'drunken biker' made me quite -unhappy- So, I will instead say this: the article clearly states the car pulled out in front of the motorcyclist, a left-hand turn, pulling out across Southbound traffic. The motorcyclist likely had all of ONE second to react. That would be the Car Driver's fault. NOT a 'drunken motorcyclist'. And it is a Far Too Common traffic offense that ends up with the motorcyclist DEAD. So, instead of throwing out baseless accusations again two seriously injured persons, one of whom may DIE as a result of a careless car-driver not paying attention, how about we wait for the FACTS. I ride, and I have lost track over the years of how many people have tried to run me down, run over me, cut me off, or sideswipe me... because they weren't PAYING ATTENTION.

Quebec may have it's own political and cultural motivations, but if the rest of us were honest, we'd be following.

All they had to do was empower the folks at Elections BC to look and suggest bipartisan campaign reform rules and even electoral reforms for a fairer system for all participants (include businesses and labor unions as well) in a democratic system.  Probably should not completely banned businesses and unions outright but set stringent limits.   I think democracy is healthier if all participants have a degree of participation.

Nowhere in the Constitution can you find a provision that says health care is a Federal responsibility.  Amendment X of the Constitution says “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  Thus, Hawaii and other states who want to continue providing health insurance to its residents now provided by CHIP can simply tax their own residents.

It's the system of how things operate within the Vatican and clearly as miss Collins states, there are obstructionists in the Vatican on this issue. Pope Francis has made some head way but a lot more needs to be done, especially in light of the abuse cases now in the spotlight from Australia.  At the very least he should lift the Pontifical Secret but I think this goes beyond just Pope Francis. There needs to be a systemic overall of the system because you can have a well intentioned Pope(who i like) but if the system of doing things at a structural level isn't overhauled it doesn't matter who sits in the Papal chair.  I think part of the reason Francis has made headway on other issues other than this is because this issue is incredibly difficult because of institutional barriers that have to be completely thrown out and overhauled.

Ms. Wente's invented portrait of university campuses is a click-baiting caricature not based on fact.  I would agree to the very limited extent that many professors are now afraid to speak frankly to their classes, and be anything more than rather bland, because any somewhat unhinged student who hasn't been listening carefully can take to the internet and blacken a professor's reputation by misrepresenting what she or he actually said, and the professor has no means of recourse.

0,"Excommunication is more a means of vengeance by an exasperated member of the hierarchy---than any spiritual remedy.

The vast majority of them [sensus fidelium] do not agree with Paprocki's extreme pronouncements [or with other bishops who share his concepts].  His actions will do more to bolster people to stand against him---rather than not.  Secondly, Paprocki only speaks for his diocese.  Other arch/dioceses have not adopted his extreme pronouncements, and they probably never will. We have had too many cases in the Church's history where people have been threatened with excommunication or actually excommunicated.  Today, these people who were threatened with excommunication or actually excommunicated, are considered as great persons within the Church or revered as actual canonized saints.

Even if one accepts the notion that EE was always a contingent replacement for KXL which is now going ahead, Justin Trudeau's utter failure to advocate for a Canadian over American pipeline is inexplicable.

There is no way we can graduate very many students if the diploma represents the ability to compete at high level colleges, and many students aren't going for that.

Consider:  a complainant alleges a sexual assault; the police investigate and gather evidence; if the police think the evidence is not sufficient they close the file; otherwise they refer the file to Crown Counsel for review; if the Crown thinks that the evidence supports a reasonable or substantial likelihood of conviction, the matter proceeds to trial; at trial the Crown presents its evidence, which is subject to challenge by the defence, and the defence presents exculpatory evidence if it so chooses; the judge or jury weighs the evidence and renders a verdict.  How is the judiciary at fault here?  The fault, if there is one, lies in the nature of the alleged offence not producing credible evidence or in the police not gathering the correct or sufficient evidence (if it exists).

Here's where the nuance comes in - that production portrayed """"Obama"""" in a sympathetic manner (https://tinyurl.com/y7jyk42a) whereas the current Julius Caesar production is a literal caricature of Donald Trump.

0,"As the muslim community in Canada grows due to our high immigration policies, and does not integrate any more (the high numbers ensure that integration and moderation do not happen), people are seeing the beginnings of a tribal divide that exists without resolve in the middle east (which will never be resolved). We don't want to be a country of sociopolitical factions in isolation but that is exactly what is happening due to high immigration. It creates a new competition-based society that makes people care less about other people because their own survival is threatened. It is changing our values: we are valuing diversity less because it is threatening survival due to economic harm created by labour oversupply and abuse of taxpayers.  The only government policy response should be to drastically decrease immigration levels, to balance the labour equation, to encourage integration and moderation and maintenance of values.

1,"Just to state the obvious: Even though the author takes the Pope's retelling of the joke about the 'woman-like' young priest with the saturno as indicative of """"a disturbing resentment of women and gay men who seek to serve the church,"""" neither group was the obvious primary intended target.  Instead, the butt of the joke were really young trad priests.  I generally agree that repeating the joke was ill conceived.  Immediately upon hearing it, I remembered an article I read here, in which Fr.

0,"And by the way...  Homosexuality is what homosexuality does.  Our passions and appetites, sexual or otherwise do not define us.  What defines us is our choices.  Hence--someone who is attracted to members of the same sex isn't homosexual--until they decide to act on that attraction--and thus define themselves--through their choice to act as homosexual.  The Church does not like labels--homosexual vs. heterosexual because we cannot reduce ourselves to our sexual appetites.  It is granted that a person cannot choose their orientation--that is who they are attracted to.  People can choose how to act.  Our choices define us.  When our appetites and passions draw us to act in ways that are contrary to reason we do not have to respond to them.  We are not animals. We can control our behavior. We can choose to master our passions---or allow our passions to master us.  The idea of self control, however, is abhorrent to liberals.

Ask yourself this: is it sane behavior to take a loaded gun to threaten youngsters at a rowdy party? Is it responsible to approach and threaten them with that gun? The placement of the shots leads one to think the """"fight"""" was over and the victims were shot when their backs were turned. Did he in cold blood shoot them when they were leaving?

0,"Recycled material has some value, even in Alaska.  If it didn't, you wouldn't be allowed to drop it off for free at the recycling center off Dowling.  I suspect all the empty barges heading south have plenty of capacity to haul it out of here.  Since the material has value, Alaska Waste must get something for it when they dispose of it.  So, in theory, they would be happy to collect more of it.  Whatever they get for the material is obviously offset by the cost to sort and transport the material.  Judging by the $14/month fee, the sorting/transport costs must vastly exceed the value of the material.  So, from an economic standpoint, Alaska Waste is offerring the following:  1) the potential to rent a smaller garbage can (offset by the $14/month charge) 2) save time for do-gooders who would recycle on their own anyway  For everyone else, it's much cheaper to just chuck everything in the garbage.

Women are perfectly able to choose their career fields, they now make up almost 60 per cent of undergrads at large universities, and there are going to be statistical disparities, including professions (veterinary, family medicine., editing etc.) where they are hugely predominant, percentage-wise.  Nothing wrong with that.

0,"President Trump is forcing all of us to find reasons to support our current institutions. that's not an inherently a bad thing.  Unless you want violent revolution, we should encourage our nation to 'stir the pot' every so often.  The problem is that President Trump feels he should be the only American (with his elite friends), to determine the course of the country and our institutions.    Personally, he's the last person I want representing my family and our values.  President Trump is overtly and without a tinge of shame, willing to denigrate the work of leadership that in some cases provided great results for the nation, including leadership of the Republican party.     It's a frightening display of arrogance and a clear grab for power from a man who has always used the power of wealth to get what he wants.  Democrats have to get off their seats and stop expecting the government to speak for them and solve all problems.  Independents will listen when Dem's have a vision.

The being driven to activities is fairly new as well - we had to make our own games and teams when we wanted to play.

About 170 exploration rigs are currently operating in Alberta (double the number of operating rigs at this time last year). Where the exploration rigs go the service rigs soon follow.  A young woman just down the road from my place is raising goats. Initially she was selling the milk to a cheese manufacturer for feta and some milk went to the lactose intolerant market.

If original sin is blame and not disobedience (there were no """"first parents"""" who went from Bushmen to some golden age of human perfection), the doctrine is not necessary. Platonic sexuality is not necessary, indeed, it arises from the take over of the Church by people who would now be called Asexuals. Not holy, just different.

Phone lines in congress were jammed up by angry constituent calls according to reports today (see the Washington Post) and even GOP congress members have stated that they were taken aback by how quickly the public soured on the proposed amendment. Pretty sure that was what caused the GOP backtracking, not some vaguely worded tweet by Trump that only criticized the timing of the amendment, not the amendment itself. The victory today belongs to the American public and their vigilance, yet the media and the pundits seems hellbent on the narrative that a late morning tweet was what caused Congress to change its mind.

0,"""""Randal Wilson"""" Those of us who have been reading your posts on this issue over the last several months have learned a lot about immigration law and practice.  Your posts have been a very valuable addition to the discussions.  From your earlier posts, I know that you do not believe that parliamentarians should use the notwithstanding clause to suspend, at least temporarily, the Supreme Court's 1985 decision in the Singh case, but readers should be aware that that is an option which is spelled out in our Constitution.  And the notwithstanding clause is not simply symbolic. It was put into the Constitution for precisely this type of situation - to allow Parliament to override, at least temporarily, a Court finding on Charter rights.  If Parliament were to invoke the notwithstanding clause in the case of the Singh decision, the Safe Third Country Agreement could be applied to those who enter Canada at locations which are not Ports of Entry.

It makes no difference as to weather the funding comes from the general excise tax, transient accommodation tax or property taxes.   In total, they all do not produce the income stream to cover the costs necessary to pay off the public workers long-term liabilities to both the pension fund and the post employment benefits fund while simultaneously paying for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of their respective governments. The only way they have stayed afloat to date is by going yet deeper into debt through the issuance of  general obligation bonds which are used more to pay off older bonds and less to build a better future for the people they govern.

Trump is dealing with potential terrorists from the immigrant ranks while Trudeau bows and scrapes to the Aga Khan.

If they had wanted to they could have voted based on the results of the popular vote and elected Hilary Clinton. That's how the electoral college works. They may have cast their votes according to which party they represented, but it was not incumbent for them to do so. It was """"designed that way"""" to ensure at the time that the constitution was written, that the northern states, which had a larger population, did not dominate over the southern states, which they would have if there had there been a direct vote. Since slaves could not vote, by using an electoral college, the south was able to count them as part of their population base (albeit at a rate of 2/3 of a person) and increase their number of electoral college votes.

It should be initially and nominally revenue negative, to allow markets time to adjust, and to account for carbon taxation hitting certain supply chains multiple times.  As it stands, this could be one of the riskiest tax hikes in Canadian history.

But when your political beliefs take on the characteristics of religious values, and you start using the Bible to support those values, the distinction is pretty tough to see and maintain.  This dangerous proclivity is conservative in the sense that political powers tend to stamp out religion as a source of legitimate authority and/or invoke religious symbols to reinforce their values. Those who seek radical transformation sound quite liberal until they have succeeded. Then they become quite repressive and conservative when the roots and fruits of what they have planted are threatened.

There are no more restrictions on the ability of Americans with pre-existing conditions to buy a plan under the ACA but there will be under the new GOP AHCA. Pre ACA medical bankruptcies were the most common cause of bankruptcy in America because insurance corps were protected by yearly and lifetime limits of how much they were obligated to pay for your care or via the recision clause they could legally drop your coverage completely if you ever incurred major medical expenses. Even if you had paid premiums for years or decades you could legally be dropped once you needed to actually use the policy. No more under the ACA but it's back in the ACHA.

Mortgages are sold all the time.  The new owner of the debt is certainly owed the money.  It depends on the original debt instrument.  In this case, the Santander was the serviced the debts for the original lender and ultimately purchased the loans from the original lender. Santander is not a third-part debt-collector, they are a financing company that makes loans and services loans.  These loans were not assigned to Santander to collect debts - Santander was collecting payments on a portfolio of loans and forwarding the payments to the lenders.  Santander purchased the loans from Citi and continued to collect payments for the loans that it now owned.  I'm struggling to see how this makes them a third-part debt collector vs. the financing company that they are.

Where I work, the underfunded DB pension plan is more than 30% of the employer's cost, with both the employer and the employee paying more than 15% of gross income (which reduces take home pay by at least 25%).  Between the taxes, various deductions and the PP, your paycheque can be surprisingly small.  A word of advice.   If you have a plan and you go to buy a house, the bank is going to tell you you can afford WAY MORE house than you can actually afford.  Incredibly, they look at your gross income more closely than your actual take home pay.  Personally, I'd rather have 32% more pay, but that's not an option.

The fact that North Korea is aggressively working on development of nuclear weapons is caused by USA policy in the region. Americans through their fear of communism could not let go of Korea. Perhaps now is a good time. If they can tolerate a communist China they should be able to accept the free expression of the 2 Koreas whatever form that would take. Russia was big enough to let go of Germany.

0,"Hi, John. This very question came up in a Catholic medical ethics class I took a few years ago. The principle of double effect comes into play here. It states that one can participate in an act that causes an intrinsic evil if their actual intention is to bring about a greater good. (An example would be the passengers of the plane that crashed in the field on 9/11. They caused the crash, but their real intent was to prevent greater loss of life.)  In the case of giving a dying person painkilling drugs, it is justifiable from a Catholic moral perspective if the intent is not to kill but to ease their suffering. This is true even if the amount necessary turns out to be a lethal dose.  Of course, """"intent"""" is tricky and people can talk themselves into anything, especially under stress. That's why it's good for such decisions to be made thoughtfully in dialogue with family members, doctors and pastoral care personnel. Nobody should be alone when they have to make life and death decisions.

0,"To this writer, Mr. Spacey's response to the allegation is intended to protect him from any legal action against any potential lawsuits that could arise from the allegation. The accused has sincerely apologized and on its face one could easily agree that he is genuinely remorseful for something. However, citing memory loss as a result of being inebriated at the time under question is more of a legal defense than a sign of contrition. In court, its difficult to prove what a witness can or can not remember. Therefore its impossible to admit to what did or did not happen. Its a standard legal defense. One thing for certain, sex crimes have an enormous psychological impact on victims which is why the Justice system treats sexual offences differently than other violent crimes.  To downplay sexual offences with word play definitions demonstrates a lack of maturity and misinformation about human relations. The law in 2017 is trying to change those misconceptions.

I was thinking of a situation I know where a mother reported abuse of her child by a priest and  few people supported her, even when it became known that a member of the hierarchy warned the priest that the police were on their way to arrest him so presumably evidence could be destroyed.  Why didn't we show more support for this hurting family when the news broke? Why didn't we demand action?  I wish I had stood on the church steps with a protest sign, I wished that there was some way to withhold donations until the church showed some accountability and remorse.  I think that the hierarchy used the lack of response from the townspeople to delay any action.  So I blame myself being a guilty bystander and doing nothing.   The courts did the right thing and placed the offender in prison. The mother who took on the church against all odds and her child are the heroes here.

0,"AshaK, The """"anti-Hinduism"""" pointed at the Gabbards by Case is a little more specific, directly towards the Gabbards because of the """"Hindu"""" religion they follow. The Gabbards are not traditional Hindu's in a sense, they are a part of a specific sect of Krishna or whatever it is officially defined as .The Gabbards are followers of the self proclaimed guru Chris Butler and his sect is often referred too as a cult [ private, closed off, only accepts members through indoctrination, most people are born into it, no official church, guru with god complex, etc]. Butler and his religious group have been in the islands for decades. I'm going to assume that Ed Case wanted to expose the cult (the assumption cults are bad), but no-one (media) took the bait. The issue with the Gabbards is brought up time and time again, but frankly, no-one cares anymore. The Butler cult followers are generally good people. Google Chris Butler and you will find all the info., including the Gabbards involvement.

The true fact is we have lots of investors buying up all the properties and turning them around and making big profits.  The state and city should have stopped this a long time ago and started taxing speculators that are doing this.  Higher taxes are needed for owners that are not occupying the property. One more thing, the State should be talking to the Mayor and City Council on permitting owner occupied vacation rentals, thats the only way this is going to be fixed.

0,"The problem with this letter is that it is all one-sided. Women also bear responsibilities, of course, as far as generalities go. There is no easy slogan that possibly could apply to all situations, i.e. date rape, stranger assault, family abuse. Each situation must be weighed and decided upon its own facts. There are risks associated with certain lifestyles, certain behaviors, certain actions. To engage in them is to decide the risks are warranted. Certainly, that doesn't affect whether or not a crime is committed, but it does imply that the victim had some volition, some responsibility in the outcome. A woman that dresses in provocative clothing, goes to a bar at 3 a. m., gets drunk, and then walks to her car several blocks away (alone or with a stranger she has just met) isn't necessarily """"asking"""" for anything.

To say you empathize implies that you get where the other person is coming from, you 'feel their pain'.  Come now, do you really?

Eisenhower rebuffed a conciliatory Khrushchev in similar fashion, and then Ike had the gall to warn us all about the """"Military Industrial Complex.""""  Grrrr.

She was raised entirely in the U.S. speaking English and attending school in America.  Unfortunately her adoptive parents neglected to apply for U.S. citizenship for her.  When she was about 20 she got in some minor legal trouble (I can't remember exactly what - smoking pot or something similar), and because she couldn't prove citizenship (and up to this point, I'm pretty sure that she had no idea she WASN'T a U.S. citizen), she was deported to Niger (which I think may be the poorest country in the world) in the middle of Africa.  She didn't speak French or any other local languages, nor did she have any friends or known relatives in the country.  Try to imagine how you would be able to fare if this happened to you?

The problem with gauging performance to a """"debt:GDP ratio"""" is that that metric is so highly distort-able as to be meaningless.  GDP is being pumped up via a housing bubble and therefore isn't *honestly* as big as it is being purported.  And Debt is being massively understated courtesy of historic and depressed interest rates.  The government of the day (to a large degree this applied to the Cons but needs to be owned by Libs and their supporters) is actively managing these to keep the numbers appearing not-dire.  The reality is that the housing market is moving towards making people homeless and/or penniless, and if the interest rates aren't tightly manipulated, the entire house of cards falls down.

Finally, its also within the Pope’s remit to break off the Holy See’s diplomatic relationship with the order, suppress the knights or abrogate their constitution - all three of which would be the equivalent of pressing the nuclear button.

The thing is, to take some one from """"not qualified"""" to """"fully qualified"""" would be 5 or 6 years. Foreign trained individuals can, in many cases, jump right in - i.e., they do not need the 5 or 6 years of training because they have had it elsewhere. The Canadian worker, however, has never had that """"training"""" and so simply cannot compete. If the available jobs could be filled by """"existing Canadians"""" they would be.

The second best step is to abolish the farcically undemocratic First-Past-the-Post system, and bring in PR. .

0,"No, it actually doesn't. The Canadian government doesn't OWN Bombadier. Considering the interdependent nature of the Canadian economy I would imagine that Canadian citizens don't own even the majority of a company like Bombadier.  But think of it this way. If a Canadian goes to a country where cocaine use is legal, can the Canadian government press criminal charges against him for using cocaine? No, the Canadian legal authority ends at its border.  Now there are many countries that have made agreements with Canada that they will work together to prosecute crimes that both countries have agreed upon. (And BTW this is ALL that is considered international law). But this requires an agreement, and I presume that in all the instances above there are no such bi-lateral legal agreements.

0,"The Presidents response of """"not that I know of,"""" is just legalize that shouts, 'I knew about it but you can't prove it'.  Know it or not, the President is responsible for the behavior of his appointed staff.     We've certainly had civilians intercede in the past with foreign nations.   Jesse Jackson and President Carter come to mind as private citizens who have volunteered to help American interest.    I'm sure Flynn felt he was doing the same.  The point of contention for me is not Flynn's transgression, it's trying to discern the intent of the Trump administration and how they plan on interacting with Russia in the future.   It seems pretty clear that they promised, through Flynn, that the Obama sanctions would be eased under a Trump administration.  Linked or not, it makes their release of information against Clinton appear to be politically motivated.  I have a big problem with that.    It must be investigated.  We need to know if that was done with American partners.

0,"I don't know how calling someone """"brave"""" could be construed as criticism or derogatory, but I suppose insults are often in the eye of the beholder. Makahs in general are brave people. Why they even have the courage to push women off docks and shoot friendly young whale cows (is that an insult to whales? Sorry, again, but it's another convention of language I was taught) with a .50 caliber anti-tank gun from an outboard-powered speedboat (to preserve their culture and tradition, of course).  No, I don't have a lot of respect for their whale hunt, in general. I have known a few good Makahs, like an old guy (my age) who told me his grandmother's oral history of the 1700 tsunami, and the friendly woman who gave me a tour of their incredible senior center (huge overhead logs that are larger than their support pillars -- not a place to be in an earthquake, perhaps). So if any tribal members want to chime in and explain to me how being called """"brave"""" is an insult, I will learn, at least.

0,"Not completely true Hank. I remember Parnell acknowledging as he signed SB21 into law that it would mean an immediate loss of revenue and we would need to tighten our belts. Oil was still around $100/bbl when he signed the new tax law into being and that is why under SB21 we were immediately collecting less production tax revenue. The collapse in oil prices only exacerbated the deficit that was brought on by the implementation of SB21. The difference in what SB21 is bringing into the state coffers and what would have happened had ACES still been in effect at these low oil prices is minimal compared to what will be the effect on oil revenue when prices go back up. We will receive such a low production tax on the new projects we are paying 65% of the cost of when they finally come online that the state will forever be in deficit spending mode. The promise of SB21 was that vastly more oil would be produced to make up for the lost revenue everyone acknowledged would happen  under SB21.

In the apocalyptic worldview that the historical Jesus and the writers of the NT shared, warfare and military activity of any kind belong to the world of sin and death, ruled over by this world's """"prince""""; and the gospel message, the heart of the new-born church, was that this world was now transcended. There is nowhere in the NT any expectation that the followers of Jesus should take up weapons and imitate the example of Barabbas and his ilk, sectarians of the so-called Fourth Philosophy. If it were ever your interest to find in either the historical Jesus or the multiform literary character of the same name in the NT some sort of divine authority favoring militarism and military activities, of any kind, you do so in vain.  2.

0,"It is certainly possible to question the wisdom of Merkel's recent refugee policies, and many thoughtful people have done that. Allowing huge numbers of refugees into Germany in a very short period of time can cause a variety of rather predictable short and long term problems. In addition to causing problems for the local population, this also creates problems for other European countries which had nothing to do with these policies, and encourages more and more refugees to come, from more and more countries. This, in turn, leads to social unrest, and may actually encourage more refugees to risk their lives by attempting unsafe passage to Europe. So, actually, Merkel's reckless and poorly thought out policies can have a negative impact on many people in several countries for years to come and are not above criticism. I actually find it refreshing that Trump actually says what he thinks on these major issues, rather than hiding his thoughts behind meaningless """"diplomatic"""" language.

Those of us with enough income to care about these things get tax advice from the Financial Planning Industry (which includes Banks, of course). They find this or that little loop-hole, occasionally illegal (off shore accounts) and probably more frequently embedded in the legal language.

It could include a 150 to 200 room hotel and concert venues. Perhaps it could be of a modest size with 1000 to 1200 slot machines and 25 or so table games. Of course it would include a nightclub and several food services/restaurants. If we got more ambitious, double the hotel to a full service one with conference center. Let the corporations like Harrahs, Hard Rock or Boyd gaming bid on the liscense.  If this idea were to come to fruition in a couple years, it could be a stimulus to a depressed construction industry that would be rife with layoffs in every sector by 2018.  Locate the casino in the east end of downtown. Open 2 smaller casinos of about half the size in Fairbanks and Mat-Su.  This idea has worked for cities like Sioux City Iowa and others.  Oh no! The tomatoes. Gotta run and duck now!

For that matter when did you last see a major politician visiting a small rural community in Oregon.  The only thing they did in Iowa was stick a weed stalk in their mouth and sit on a bale of hay for photographers.  *Oh, they did pay attention to corporate farmers, their crop subsidies and their tax offsets.  Most Republican candidates  'equal rights' concerns, are often nothing more than protecting their own economic privilege.  I don't expect anymore than that, they general live up to my low expectation.  What hurts is Democratic lip service that has yet to transform these area's of great need.   They could try spending time in these homes, on these streets, talking with these families, but it's so much easier to make promises on TV or, send a check.  Sucks to be poor.

Most chronic drug users are self-medicating emotional and psychological problems such as ADHD and PTSD, typically stemming from childhood trauma.

Q) What is the feeling like on the ground at the moment?  Depressing.

But accounting isn't the same as cost management.  Organizations that excel in the latter tie goals to the activities that must be performed to achieve them, and then link those activities to specific operating and capital costs. I've never seen a school district in Colorado that does that. For example, ask a Supe or School Board Member how much they spend on teacher professional development (including direct costs and the value of professionals' time), what metric(s) they use to assess its effectiveness and efficiency, and what return taxpayers are getting on this investment.

To become an enduring force in BC politics, the Greens need a change to proportional representation and to show the public that our parliamentary system can work well in the BC context when no Party has the majority of MLAs. This will require the current accord to operate effectively for at least 2 years.  Likewise, the NDP wants to break the historic pattern whereunder they are with rare exception always the Loyal Opposition and their rare opportunities as Government are short and end badly (and constant dust-ups with the Greens will not promote this objective).  The key is for both Parties to show the public through their conduct that they can have differences but manage these difference in ways that allow ongoing good administration and progress in BC's affairs.

0,"Meyer was president of Cheniere a decade ago when he oversaw the development of the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal in Louisiana, the largest such LNG facility in North America. The question that needs to be asked is """"How much natural gas has been imported through that facility"""". The answer is """"None"""".  In effect we hired Meyer who oversaw a failed project to guide our project and tell us it will work. Chenier has spent a lot of money to convert the facility to now EXPORT natural gas. Glad Peter Micciche identified this failure.  The market changed, just as it did for Palin's LNG Pipeline . Times have changed for Alaska LNG as well.  A couple of years ago Asia LNG was upwards of $16 per million BTU, now it is approximately $4 per million BTU.  Much less than our cost to get LNG there. We should have no more interest in this project than the oil companies. If they bail, time to stop wasting money on a project that has the potential to lose significant money year after year.

Canada is the largest oil product supplier to the U.S. 70% of the oil we produce goes to the U.S.  40% of the oil they rely upon comes from Canada. The trade value between nations is $1.4 trillion.  Canada's trade relationship with Michigan is larger than its' trade with the EU.  Both countries have had prosperous trade relations even before Canada was a nation.  There is no country that even remotely comes close to the size and scope of this economic relationship. Unfortunately, matters of economy seem not to be taken seriously by our government.  As with the EU trade deal, the government presents as unprepared and not taking this trade relationship seriously as seen with their presentation of issues to be addressed that have nothing to do with trade.  Canada is dealing with a nationalist populist American government. It needs to remind the U.S. of our 150 years of trade.

0,"bog hog - In fact the RCMP are enforcing the law. Section 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act prohibits charges being laid against people entering the country illegally until their protection claim is decided. The section is part of the immigration law as it is part of an international treaty on refugees from 1951 that Canada has agreed to uphold since 1967.  Are people being arrested by the RCMP for crossing the border illegally? Of course they are. The RCMP then hands them to the CBSA who deals with them according to the immigration law. In some cases people are kept in detention until their claim is decided. Most are released after they have been vetted for identity and criminal records. If they fail their refugee claim, they get removed from Canada. There is no story here, just a lot of misinformation and lack of knowledge about the issue.

There are exceptions, Tom Doyle and Bishop Thomas of Helena come to mind, but again, the exceptions only serve to prove the rule.  In the end, I think EPBenedict had it right, the Church will shrink to a small remnant of true believers because the reality is that humanity is moving beyond the need for the absolute security the Church is still trying to sell.

The Liberals were Canadian and had a lock on Canadian values, and the Conservatives weren't and so were the people who voted for them. Similar sentiments were expressed by Trudeau in London. The phrase was dropped after much ridicule and more then a little commentary on how even after being away from government, the Liberals clung to their Toronto elitism and arrogant ways.

And Christ is saying: Come on! Turn around! Return to me with all your heart!’  “…It is time for each one of us to recognize that he is being urged on by Jesus Christ. Those of us who sometimes feel inclined to put off this decision should know that, now, the moment has come.

0,"Bob-thank you for the kind words.  Unfortunately, fund balances are not the result of intentionally collecting more taxes while knowing that expenses will be a lesser amount. Fund balances grow when warm winters resulting in less spent on snow removal and heating costs than budgeted, or because an entity experiences increased employee attrition.  Fund balances are not the result of simply asking for money than expected need.  Financial plans require expenditures to equal revenues, so in essence, a spending cap already exists with the current tax cap.  A new, unnecessary spending cap encourages short term waste of fund balances as government pumps up budgeted spending levels, using fund balances as a revenue source to enhance the level of future spending cap calculations.  I know that's not the intent, but that's what will happen.

0,"Thank you Susan. I have lived in Canada for twenty-eight years and have been a dual citizen for nearly five years.  I have often been in the in and out phase you describe. The questions of identity and self determination posed are wrenching ones at times. When one has responsibilities for elderly relatives south of the 49th yet feels less and less able to navigate their environment, well, it gets even more complicated. Nevertheless, your story has helped me forge ahead into my next chapter(s), as purely and simply, a very proud Canadian.

0,"Sigh! How unfortunate that the wont of the human condition is to measure prosperity in terms economic growth, which is achieved by an increasing human population consuming more and more natural resources ... and polluting what's left. It doesn't take rocket science to realize that the bubble will burst sooner or later; we will either all perish from famine and pestilence or from wars fighting over increasingly fewer resources. I'd say there are maybe two or three human generations left on Earth, which further goes to make me wonder why humans are still popping kids. But, then, we aren't very good at seeing further than next quarter's profits ... or learning from our historical mistakes.

It steals and settles land for decades, it brutalizes and oppresses the local population, making daily humiliation of the Palestinians part of its state policy, it is constantly warned that the world does not accept its illegal claims, yet it is so privileged that it expects the US to constantly shield it from any consequences for its illegal activities. The US has enabled Israel for decades. Under Trump, this will get worse. Hopefully, however, this is the beginning of more concerted and organized action by the rest of the world community against Israel's injustices. The level of hubris and entitlement that Netanyahu displays here is truly disgusting.

What is novel now is that those opinions are no longer being dismissed. He was not a widely respected man in his own time, but his image was brushed up by the Orange Lodge, his allies, and Tories who had few successes, and later by a need to emulate the worship of founders in other countries.  He was an embarrassment to the country, then as now, and it is claiming otherwise that is revisionism.

While you may look at what happened to insurance companies and doctors and the economic impacts of such, one thing you are overlooking are the millions of individuals who now had access to healthcare, thus helping them get jobs, stay healthy enough to retain jobs, and help rebuild the economy.  A free and open health care marketplace is a decent idea, but just in principle. When you factor in greed, corruption, and the lust for more money what you get is companies offering great care for steep prices while others will join the game by offering cheap, crappy care, hoping to scrape the bottom of the barrel for a dollar.

That's why they have Secret Archives at the Vatican and a safe for secret documents, in every Bishop's Palace. and that was also a secret ..... up to now.

0,"As 'Airdog' correctly notes on this thread, the US is underestimating NK.  No expert denies that by 2020 NK will have thermonuclear ICBMs capable of annihilating the US. Indeed, many experts believe that NK could kill hundreds of millions of Americans now with the WMDs they definitely have.  NK is closely allied with other tyrannical police states such as Syria & Iran with whom they have cooperated on WMD weaponry.  Sanctions/diplomacy are not going to halt NK's acquisition of H-bombs and ICBMS.  Russia & China may well want NK to have WMD capability and destroy the US so that a Sino-Russian alliance could expand throughout the world.  The best option for the US now is to develop boost-phase interceptors to counter enemy ICBMs and to inform Americans that the enemies who may well kill 100s of millions of Americans are not named """"Trump.""""  These NK threads are incredible for the lack of criticism bloodthirsty tyrants like KJU receive while always heaping abuse on our """"man in the arena.""""

As shown below, in the climateforyou.com graph, long term global sea levels have not shown any significant change from the long term trend. So it will be safe to walk in NYC Battery Park for many years to come.  Climate is incredibly complex, and a very long term issue, involving time periods from decades to millions of years. It not only involves the earth alone, but solar activity, as well as orbital variations, as the earth moves about the sun, and even stars (cosmic rays), well beyond our sun.  From the limited amount of data humans have accumulated to date, there has yet to be a definite answer to how much are human influencing climate. Like somewhere between 0.01% & 99.9%

While we're at it, let's eliminate the loopholes that cost the federal government the most money:  1.  The standard deduction and personal exemptions. 2.  Tax free treatment of welfare payments and benefits. 3.  Tax free treatment of the employer-paid portion of health insurance premiums.  If you look up the list of top corporate welfare recipients, as I recall, 7 or 8 of the top ten are unionized.  Boeing is far and away the leader, and they're making billions a year.  BTW, the federal government is making more money on oil than the oil companies are.  Same goes for tobacco.

0,"<Antifa is going to have to rethink their own strategy of confrontation because the next battle may very easily move beyond pepper spray and baseball bats.> I totally agree.  Violence is not the answer, and the resistance does not need to rely on it.  Resistance demonstrators would do well to undergo training in non-violence techniques to help them to think deeply about what they are doing and how they are doing it.  We also need police and law enforcement to be well trained and well staffed in order to respond quickly and effectively.  All eyes will be on Boston this weekend.  Let us pray for peace -- for peaceful, non-violent witness against the filth of Nazis, fascists and the KKK.

0,"I believe that the majority of people in Canada, the US and, indeed, the world are decent. They have likes and dislikes but they are not haters nor do they have much tolerance for haters. There are fringe haters on both sides of the political spectrum but their influence is not significant. Unfortunately they can advertise their views (or have their views advertised) in the media very readily but the spread of their influence is minimal. Today, the Liberal/left/progressive element of our society has taken to labelling vast numbers of people who do not agree with their social narratives as being lesser human beings than themselves - less able to determine legitimate values, less educated and less noble. Having lost the patience and respect of the people they denigrate, progressives are shocked by the fact there is scant enthusiasm for them or their social diktats. The simple fact is that they have offended a great many people with their affectation of moral and intellectual superiority.

0,"Those mortgages are bundled and sold to investors, and most have either individual CMHC on the underlying deals, or portfolio insurance covering them in bunches.  OR they are explicitly/implicitly government-backed due to being under the Canada Mortgage Bond program (or whatever it is called now). Even normal, uninsured bank mortgages effectively are taxpayer-subsidized, since everyone knows that in a Canadian bank failure taxpayers would pay off every penny that bank owed.  (We are only legally obliged to pay deposit insurance, but in the 80's we paid every penny on such failures, and the US did the same in their crisis.  Investors know all this.  Too-big to fail must die!!)

0,"Your attempt fails, of trying to argue that rich immigration-buyers from China of recent decades are somehow comparable to immigrants a century ago from China who paid a head tax.  You say a century ago they had to fork out the equivalent of about ten months of a B.C. sawmill worker's income. Hello? With investor immigration programs of recent decades, folks have been shelling out about TEN YEARS of a BC sawmill worker's income. You are comparing kayaks to aircraft carriers, the relative wealth of recent immigrants is way, way higher than the historical example you raise.  More pertinent is that those folks from China a century ago, they had to work at jobs locally, earning wages that did not hyper-inflate house prices. I have written many times that Vancouver would not have had its house price mess if Canada had simply taken in the same number of folks from China in recent decades, but from strata of wealth (middle class, lower middle class etc.) representative of Canada's levels.

Resist, however and wherever you can.

0,"Thanks Keiran, I knew you would at least reply. I believe it was indeed both, but the 'systemic' aspect was one which was based not on clericalism or conservatism, but on liberal sexual views about clergy and homosexuality which was and still is to a lesser extent, seeking to be the norm in the Church as opposed to traditional or conservative sexual approaches. And that's my point. Of course many chose not ot offend, but many do. Again, I say it: unless we accept that offending occurs because of errors in both conservative AND liberal thinking, agendas and approaches, the issue of clergy sexual abuse of both children and adults, will not be solved. I must admit that my emphasis is on abuse of adults and while there are definite parallels, there are also differences, especially in the general population of those who offend. Its a sweeping generalization but I have seen a trend in conservative clergy being child abusers, and liberal clergy being adult abusers. We have to address both.

0,"Sharon Winner - As long as Alaska's education establishment plays the """"Washington Monument"""" card every time there is talk about a minor cut to education nobody in his right mind can take them seriously.  After all, we can easily cut 15% or even 20% from the education budget without any impact on the class room, but Alaska's education establishment, with their public union leading the way, refuses to cut overhead and administration positions and insist on class room cuts.  The education establishment should work with the people of Alaska to find solutions to the budget problems by cutting overhead and administration positions and combining half-empty schools rather than acting like they have their heads in the sand.
