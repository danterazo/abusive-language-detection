0,"Hillary is guilty.  The investigation into her email servers found gross negligence, inept mishandling of classified document, criminal sharing of sensitive classified information and exposed national secrets and probably intelligence assets to discovery by foreign govts.  The facts are evident. The FBI chose not to prosecute for political reasons that only they know (speculation).  The question is, does someone have to be charged and  prosecuted to be guilty?  Legally before sending them away to do time, yes; however how many times have each of us determined whether we trust someone based on their actions?  Don't we make decisions about whether we trust someone around or children, spouses, our homes, etc without out waiting for a criminal indictment?  Don't we protect ourselves from the criminal element even though they are not under indictment? We know Hillary is guilty.  Her non-indictment mean the Rule of Law is not applied equally, Obama's (Hillary's) USA is a Banana Republic.

0,"Tactics of Rebuttal: The 4D Approach  Russia’s narrative can be viewed as an offensive weapon.  When it comes to defending Russia, different tactics are used. They can be summed up in four words: dismiss, distort, distract, dismay.  Dismiss: The first Russian approach to negative reporting or comment is to dismiss it, either by denying the allegations on the ground, or denigrating the one who makes them.  Distort: Russian officials and media have also developed a strong tendency to distort information to serve their overall narrative.  Distract: A further tool in Russia’s information arsenal is distraction: turning attention away from the activities of Russia and its allies by launching accusations elsewhere.  Dismay: The final key tool in Russia’s communications arsenal is to spread dismay, by warning that moves which Russia opposes will have disastrous consequences for those planning them.  It’s a brand of information warfare, known as dezinformatsiya.
"
0,"Prevention can be approached from the perspective of preventing people from becoming victims, or of preventing people from becoming perpetrators. You are focusing on potential victims; I believe the social preference is to focus on potential perpetrators. In an ideal society, you don't have to protect yourself from crime, because there are no criminals; while that ideal is not achievable, we should certainly try to get as close to it as possible.

0,"Just more of the looting of the nation by the Trump empire to protect the worst president in the history of the nation devoted to the destruction of the Constitutional Republic and all human rights and freedom contained therein.

0,"Finally, this is not a turf issue. Our study suggested division among psychologists in the state. Nationally, some of the strongest opponents are psychologists, like me, who believe that the lack of evidence and growing concerns about safety suggest we should be slowing legislative efforts to pass the minimal training standards we think we can pass in order to actually understand how to safely and effectively train psychologists to expand their tool kit to include medications. In point of fact, proponents have produced no credible evidence to suggest they are prescribing safely or effectively. Recent data from the Part D Prescriber Public Use File (PUF) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) suggests that some medical psychologists from Louisiana and prescribing psychologists from New Mexico have been prescribing beyond the legislative bounds of their licenses. Lawsuits in Louisiana also suggest caution, not hubris should guide the RxP movements.

0,"Schembri’s speech showed how the Bank of Canada is constrained, quite appropriately, by its need to be politically impartial. Business investment, as the Conservative opposition has repeatedly said, is being stymied by the Liberal government raising business costs with higher taxes and their socialist lite threats to raise taxes on the rich. These weren’t acted on in this budget but the continued warnings from Morneau raise business anxieties. It would have been better to get all such measures implemented in the first budget, so the business community knew what kind of business environment they would have to operate in. And now the Trudeau government’s grossly irresponsible refugee policies are threatening to thicken the border between Canada and the US when the Trump regime inevitably responds. That must be another disincentive for businesses to invest in this country.

0,"You were saying it's impossible to edit an amendment. Then you narrowed the field to the bill of rights, now you're narrowing it to just the second. At this moment - it certainly isn't on the cards, there's no movement currently with any chance of achieving it. The majority may favour it - but they aren't a large enough majority to get an amendment through. But you're still wrong if you think it's impossible - it's decidedly not. Article 6 of the constitution explicitely allows the possibility.  Politically feasible is an entirely different thing.  Ironically though - America seems to be filled with rightwingers who seriously think that this is something the democrats could do. In the run-up to the 2016 election gun sales soared everytime somebody said """"Hillary wants to take your guns"""". Considering that a gun ban was nowhere in her platform - why would that be ? They used to say the same about Obama, and spike sales everytime. He came, served, went, without taking a single gun.
"
0,"Not true at all.  I was made stateless due to section 8.  I moved to Canada with my family as an infant.  My parents secured citizenship for themselves and their five children, I'm the youngest and I'm the only one in the family to lose citizenship.  My entire life is and has always been here in Canada and I'm not a dual citizen.  I attended public schools, paid taxes, voted, etc.  Had my family been informed of the need to retain my citizenship prior to my 28th birthday, I would have, but we were not informed.  Many MP's and Senators know about this ongoing injustice.  We (The Lost Canadians) are waiting with bated breath for this government to fix the remaining issues in our citizenship act.  Hopefully before our 150th .

0,"That is incorrect AR. Mueller's attorney didn't do his homework. Ms. Swift never said a word to anyone and the Judge dismissed her on Friday. It was her mom and promoter?agent? that spoke with Mueller's Boss and neither works for Ms. Swift but instead a third party company that Ms. Swift also works for. Ms. Swift's attorney's new they had won the minute they received the complaint. Mueller's attorney blew any chance of his having any chance of winning the case. I wouldn't be surprised if Mueller goes after him for malpractice. And the typical tactic for the filing of appeal is countered by a Motion for attorneys fees which Mueller can't afford so he will try to agree to drop the appeal if Swift will drop the attorney fees. She may not do it because of the rude comment that Mueller's attorney made in his closing argument that obviously provoked Ms. Swift.

0,"A Democratic congresswoman from Texas, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, stated today that the women were responsible for the situation they create with the attire and behavior they exhibit.  So it appears Ms. Bialik was more right than most people who criticized her.  In another story in the NY Post, a former waitress, Jade Budowski, at Robert Di Niro's restaurant, stated the constant use of the restaurant by Mr. Weinstein to carry out his deviant activities with the full knowledge of the staff and owner of the restaurant for many years.  The description by Ms. Budowski of the women who were subject to Mr. Weinstein's attention surely met the descriptions and attire that Ms. Bialek addressed in her posted comments.  So with the truth and facts coming to light as time moves on, many of those who are being thrown under the bus by their Hollywood compatriots are going to get the last laugh when the dust settles on the """"casting couch"""" environment fostered in the film industry.

Do you want to drive these companies away and jeopardize our own manufacturing overseas?  We have a global economy and it is not going away. Get use to it.

For goodness sake, why cannot everyone accept & say publicly & with pride, that the ANC was part of this struggle not the excusive vehicle.

""""..It is our priority to definitively regain the loyalty ... of the people."""" This is classic - why should the ANC depend on the loyalty of anyone?? Either their policies to unite the people, to uplift the poor and to create wealth in SA from which we will all benefit work  or they do not!. If not, then another party will/should be voted in to take over from the ANC government. That is how actual democracy works - not on the basis of """"loyalty""""!!

0,"You touch on PSG and Inter not having great recognition here in the US.  That factor warrants more attention on your part.  Scanning through the event's list of matches played in the US this summer, the PSG/Inter match-up warrants a place in the bottom two.  There's no doubt Real/ManU would have sold out Autzen.  Tonight's Chelsea/Liverpool match in the Rose Bowl would have doubled the attendance.  Why?  Relocated Brits say the Barclay's Premier League is more accessible now on TV/tablets for American viewers than it is in England.

He talked about the growth in awareness of ways in which we discriminate, or """"othering"""", seeing those who are not part of the dominant group as """"other"""" - to use Mikulich's story line, as Muslim, farmer, African American, Jew.  And as Fr. Peter says:  """"These and many more are not the """"other"""" to be feared and kept at arm's length, but people to be included and honoured and valued as sisters and brothers.""""

0,"Thanks Christa.  Just as an FYI, when I'm trying to read threads, I find it quite useful to have the name of the person to whom i'm replying available, for several reasons.  Obviously, many of us who have been here a while know a lot about where we each come from.  In this new system, we've given the first few lines of the post, but often the response is to something further into that prior post.  With this system, we've gotta scroll back up, and reread the original posts to find what they're talking about.   And history suggests this will get even more complex, for thoughts can develop over multiple posts in a thread.  So for me, having this isn't about """"voting,"""" as much as it is a matter of maintaining a high quality of dialog.  Not having that ability (either to see who a poster was responding to, or for that matter, what they were responding to) without having to search and connect dots seems odd.  Maybe as this all goes forward, it'll all get to make more sense for me.

You are continually telling us that you subject Catholic doctrine to the test of your own intellect and accept it or reject it according to your own lights, which renders what you believe no more than a personal, individual credo. Are you seriously proposing that apostasy from the Catholic Faith has no eternal consequences? If you are then let's have some back up and not just careful selections from various Church documents. When has the Church ever condoned apostasy? It is well-known that most of your posts misrepresent the comments of those you reply to; we all know the 'devices', 'what he is really saying', 'what he really means is'; the continual creation of strawmen which you then proceed to knock down.It is so easy to tilt at windmills of your own creation.

But if it is true, it shows a poor thought process on the city's part. Antifa is bad news. Some cities in the west have started making them remove their masks before they allow them in. Weapons are taken away, and I suspect photos are taken. That should be a minimum requirement for anywhere they meet. Same thing for the KKK if they were to arrive with hoods on. Yes, Antifa should have been arrested.

1,"Understand the Democrats are upset they lost and probably still in shock since ALL the media said Clinton was going to win in a landslide. President Trump Condemned the Hate, KKK, Natzi, what is wrong with that ? What the heck do you people want him to do ? He is NOT a racist and He does NOT support the KKK or ANY Hate group. And YES there were TWO groups fighting, which he stated and its a FACT.  FYI - The Democrats had a KKK leader in the senate for 4 decades who was Clinton and Obama friend. And the truth is the Democrats are the party of hate. There were a few hundred white nut jobs out there and they DO NOT represent the GOP, Americans or myself or any sain person. We are not RACIST !!  Please STOP the B$, you people who HATE the President should GET A LIFE and let him do his job. Sick of the Media claiming him a racist and anyone who supports him a racist, its a LIE and DISTORTING the facts. CNN and the main stream media = Propaganda for the left !

0,"Loosing the stairs is not really a big deal in my opinion--not only are there other peaks with equivalent views there are also several other ways to access the peak. I strongly sympathize with the neighborhood that has to deal with a huge increase in traffic and often unconscientious hikers.  Mr. Goody's comment that the stairs can handle 60-80 people a day is laughable. The trail is wilding popular with not just locals, who might follow the rules, but also the tourist and transient set. Yay instagram and the internet I guess.  There is little reason to think that the a parking lot and opening the stairs would any better allow us to mitigate hiker traffic. I cannot think of a single other area on Oahu where any attempt to regulate and reduce visitor traffic has been successful.  A solution that does not properly address the concerns of the neighborhood is not in my mind a solution.  Also I don't live there.

Dr Patterson has shown us one serious contradiction in GC Working Policy.  There are probably others.  In these cases the wisest course is to remove the contradiction, and permit lower-level entities to determine the appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.

In return, the RAF initially wanted either 167 or 144 aircraft, later 100, then 67. . After Suez, that deal went sideways: Canada had let the side down by agreeing with Eisenhower.  Britain ended its interest. Nobody ever said those events were linked, but clearly, they were. . Suddenly the production run was cut by 60%, and Canada would also have to absorb the cost of building a brand new, state-of-the-art, gas turbine engine development program from scratch. . The cost per unit eventually sextupled over the original estimate. . The Iroquois engine was a world-beater. So was the Arrow's airframe. . We couldn't afford it. . But it is criminal that the program was cancelled after 5 prototypes were flying, and everybody knew it was a winner, technologically.  The money had already been spent.

Another point that has curiously not been discussed in this case is that it is reported that a phone signal was received from his cell phone up until about 10:30 PM, and presumably ceased at that time.  WHY did his cell phone signal cease at that time?  My first thought here is that if he had fallen into the gorge of one of the creeks along this trail system, it would explain both his disappearance as well as the disappearance of his cell phone signal.  I can't help but notice that it would take approximately 45 minutes to reach the precipitous gorge of either Glacier or Winner Creek from the trailhead from which he apparently started his hike.

0,"Judge Matsch is one of the fairest judges that has ever been on the bench & while I respect his decision, I have seen the other side of this equation. I had a guy working for me that had molested a 12 & 14 year old daughters of his girlfriend. From what I witnessed, no amount of treatment ever cures them. They had to stay in groups to try and control their actions. One guy lured his prey into isolated places on the premise of making candles; another guy was sent back to prison after it was found out he had sex with a dog while two other guys watched; all in therapy. I am convinced the only thing that kept them civil was the stringent rules that keep them accountable. If these are decided to be unconstitutional; then the courts need to stringently hand down sentences that keep these guys off the streets. The guy that worked for me is depicted on the net as a predator. I am still convinced he will strike again. If we can't protect our children, let other prisoners help deter their acts.

He just admitted to molesting boys decades ago and is proof that the sexual abuse of children is still being hidden in the church. Another victim of Marsicek came forward two months ago. The courageous girl is now 16 and the family found out after the girls mother invited the priest over for dinner. There will be many more victims coming forward from the acts of this sick man who were needlessly molested because both Listecki and Dolan knew about the many complaints of this man. They choose to call them boundary violations and continue the same rhetoric.

0,"Imagine with me. The US goes to the UN and works to gain a new comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, and a treaty that obligates all nations to abolish nuclear weapons by 2050. That treaty allows the UN to stop nuclear proliferation in the entire world, from Korea to Israel, from Pakistan to, well, India. As long as the US has thousands of nuclear weapons it is hardly able to jawbone other countries who want the same level of protection. The US sends tens of billions of dollars to Israel, which introduced the same weapons into the Middle East and has them pointed at Iran. Reason would have a chance to prevail if we used reason and common sense as a weapon of State. I suspect we would have a better chance of prying all the rifles from the fingers of Texans than we would have a chance to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I suspect the only way the world will get rid of those weapons is after a regional war that kills tens of millions in a flash. Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

However since virtually all our needs and services are provided by the private sector, we know that the private sector is very capable. Health care in the private sector.

Further there was/is no real connection between the US poor and the excellent medical, not health care, system.  That connection can be made with a Guaranteed Annual Income for the poor.

0,"I like the thinking behind this article, but it leaves out what I see as a significant political risk they have. These bankers are hugely coddled by our federal governments and regulatory climate. And their greed for profits are driving them to ever more aggressive exploitation of their customers - note all the news about investment advisors under pressure to mislead and dupe their customers. Long bubbling public dissatisfaction can turn to hot rage as these guys keep pushing over historic boundaries. At some point we might see enough public pressure to bring the government into a mood to introduce some real competition in this sector which is sorely sorely needed plus some real measures to stop the ongoing games . Behind it all we have markets utterly dominated and characterized by speculation leading to inherent instability as well as unlimited cheating through the very large and anonymous offshore system of hideaways.  Rage at the whole financial system may yet explode.

So absent an observable special case like the brave person who posted earlier, recording an accurate fact is not discriminatory.  Similarly, the birth certificate should not be altered retroactively, as that would  falsifying a public record.  However, for any other piece of ID, health card, driver's license etc, a 3rd, neutral category should not present an issue.  About the only time that a birth certificate is presented is during the application process for a Canadian passport -- it's not something that's used on a regular basis.

0,"Rudy Budesky I do not choose to share a bathroom with men with whom I am not in a sexual relationship. I don't urinate at home while my son is brushing his teeth at the sink next to the toilet, either.  What part of this don't you understand? The reason bathrooms have traditionally been segregated is that the vast majority of people don't want to be sexually harassed or ogled while going to the bathroom. Believe it or not, human beings have sexual drives and those sexual drives (usually aimed at the opposite biological gender) are (in men, particularly) driven by the sight of a naked human body. Some of us care whether our state of undress elicits a sexual response in a stranger and we choose to prevent that by not disrobing in public, but it is almost impossible for women to not expose private areas while going to the bathroom.  I know, it doesn't bother you. You like to get your jollies off. I don't and my feelings and those who think likewise should matter in this discussion.

0,"I'm a high school teacher, and I agree with you.  Not just because they worked well before, but also because I'm convinced those activities (cursive writing, memorization, etc.) build important neural connections that are important to learning.  Cursive writing forces the mind to concentrate and slow down, which helps wire the attention sections of the brain.  Memorizing builds important neural connections, consolidating learning into long-term, more easily-retrievable memory.  Research also needs to be done as to the effects of diet and technology on learning.  I shudder when I see the amount of sugar and processed food many students eat; how a brain can function effectively on such a diet is beyond me.  The effects of technology (and the decreased attention span caused by it) also need to be studied.  The answer to the math problem is highly faceted....to just blame teachers (and I work with many really incredible ones) just delays real solutions to this increasingly dire situation.

0,"I think the importance of socialist style programs is often diminished. Aside from the military (the single largest component of our budget), the critical importance of public education, public transportation and infrastructure projects, public research, and public protections against the interests of wealthy elites are the absolute cornerstones of our freedom and economic power.  A good example for me is always water in the front range. A crazy high percentage of the water that eastern Colorado relies upon for agriculture and to support the booming economy comes from public reservoirs in western Colorado through a publicly funded tunnel underneath Rocky Mountain National Park. Without that socialist infrastructure the large towns and the vibrant agriculture of the front range/eastern Colorado would simply not be possible. It is foundational to our economy and vibrancy. Private industry never would have done that.

But experts in economics from all sides have said his numbers don't pencil out. Those economists aren't parasites, they are smart and educated super accountants we should all listen to.  Everyone on the right screamed when the debt shot up while Obama was president. I wonder what the response will be when that debt doubles under Trump? So far, his budget hints (more military spending, deportations with 30 thousand new officers, new courts and jails, a 20-billion wall that Mexico won't pay for, infrastructure jobs and increased military spending) indicate that we will spend far more than we take in as revenue. It doesn't pencil out, not at all.

Men who do this don't share it with all other men, just others they think are like minded. I, for example, happily married young (and still happily married) was spared the leering, bragging, ***hole behavior of the sexual bullies.

0,"The words """"white privilege"""" are badly chosen, and raise hackles unnecessarily. The creators of the term were looking for a shorthand way of summarizing things like the fact that identical resumes, one named Jamal and the other John, get substantially different response rates from potential employers. That can be tested as often as you like, both by sending the test resumes to real employers or by having volunteers in labs review sample resumes. The people doing the reviews honestly believe that they have no bias -- but the bias is experimentally provable over and over again. If the bias can be triggered by a name on paper, it can certainly be triggered by a face. Whiteness helps you get a job, or in any other social situation involving white decision makers. The difficulty of getting people to accept this fact (and it is a fact) is that any individual case of white privilege is invisible, both to the employer conferring it and to the recipient. It is not deliberate, but it's there.

0,"Mr. York,  Your sources are misleading you, or you mislead yourself. The so-called Trump dossier is verified in part, and unverified in part. None of it has been proven false.  None.  The arguments against veracity originate with two hastily written articles published shortly after the dossier hit the front pages. What is the veracity of these articles?  Owen Matthews: """"Thirteen Things That Don’t Add Up In The Russia-Trump Intelligence Dossier."""" It is Matthew's assertions that fall apart. Not one holds water. Paul Roderick Gregory, a pro-Russian, anti-American """"economist"""": “The Trump Dossier Is Fake -- And Here Are The Reasons Why.” Gregory is, to be kind, a Russian stooge. His article is Russian disinformation without substance. Drop me a line if would like more details.  """"Unverified"""" is a neutral term. """"Verified"""" is positive. So far, everything in the dossier falls into those two categories. All else is speculation based on nothing but the biases of the writer.  Cheers

It creates a phantom enemy to rally its citizens against, to have a common enemy to keep the ruling family and its henchman in power   Past discussions to reduce this problem have only made it worse, as North Korea merely uses the time to continue down the path  toward nuclear feasibility.  Trump has at least tried harder to do the one diplomatic thing that really has any chance at success, that is to convince China to put more economic and political pressure on North Korea.  This may be the only hope of a peaceful solution.  But  I am not convinced that KJU cares about economic sanctions that only hurt the average citizen of NK.

We are a pro-immigrant country and I think that President Trump is simply saying we need to do it legally. Additionally, he must.

0,"Indeed, athletic scholarships are a huge opportunity for many young men and women.  They may lead to a professional career, but only for about 1% of the recipients.  However, they can also lead to a college education, a degree and a better life 'after college athletics.'  We read about that 1% who turn pro.  We read about that 5 or so percent who """"screw up"""", lose their scholarships and sometimes go to jail or prison.  Over my 46 years in the area Oregon has had its share in both categories.....great success stories and some very very sad tales... Marcus Mariota and Colt Lyeria times X.

Though classified as a comedy in the First Folio and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is perhaps most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and is best known for Shylock and the famous """"Hath not a Jew eyes?"""" speech.

There are far greater spiritual topics on which to focus our energies and our spiritual health should not be affected by the vocal arguing of a few. IMHO, those who argue against WO do so from a very literalist view of scripture and Paul did tell the women to keep silent in church. At the same time, we must consider that the culture of that place and time was far different than today. God transcends culture because the Gospel is based on the principles of God's love, not human interpretation of them. Just as in that time, we must learn to apply spiritual principles to our lives today and stop trying to live in another time.

Get out and vote for folks who hold the interests of Alaskans over the interest of corporate greed.  Coffee time!

0,"The French system is largely a single-payer, government-funded system.  The government reimburses citizens for most health care costs, on an income-related scale.  As for American's views on health care, they are obtuse, blinded by the words """"socialized medicine"""".  Rant and rave all you want about my point of view, but they've managed to create the most expensive health care system in the world with one of the lowest life expectancies, highest infant mortality rates and the highest rate of personal bankruptcy due to catastrophic illness in the G20.  Not exactly a ringing endorsement of their handling of this issue.  .
"
0,"A key point to that story  is that Jesus is God. The embodiment of God on earth. So, the focus isn't just atonement but is that God dwelt among the people and experienced rejection and death. Some Christian groups (non trinitarian especially) focus on the atonement of sins heavily, and some - not as much. There are as many ways to interpret it as there are denominations (and likely more). So it is hard to paint it all with one broad stroke.

There is no guarantee that lowering the rate will result in jobs or US economic benefit. Corporations could simply take the savings and invest elsewhere.

Let’s enact policy that isn’t based on “a wing and prayer”. Who knows, if the carrot trick works for Trump maybe we could do the same with Alaska oil. ;)

The warm period we are in now has lasted for about 10 thousand years and I don't believe there are many scientist that can guarantee that there will be no more cold periods. I believe it is good to limit harmful pollutants but to spend billions to scrub CO2 which is  not harmful to living things seems a waste since it would necessarily cause energy cost to skyrocket. Just look at how much CO2 an acre of trees can remove from the atmosphere. There have been people invested in companies dealing in carbon credits who kept pushing this climate change narrative possibly for financial gain.

You don't meet violence with violence, you let the far right exhibit the behaviours they are known for, such as intolerance, stupidity  and hatred.   That is enough to have them relegated to the fringe where they belong.  However, the msm as usual makes little to no effort to overcome their tendency to speak only in politically correct terms instead of delving into the issues.  Corporate think. Problem with terming too many people as left is that it renders the word meaningless.  Feminists are not left; BLM is not left; etc. Also, I have no issue with dismantling these statues of these barbaric men, but again Trump is right, why not Washington (largest land owner at the time and slave owner) and Lincoln (big time slave owner)?

We have no religious test for political office, and shouldn't; but I do like to try to understand what a candidate thinks and believes about the world.

0,"I don't necessarily disagree with what your saying.  However, home ice advantage hasn't been a factor for the Sens in either of their series..  They had road victories in both series which eliminated the need to have a game 7 on home ice.  Plus they played better on the road in the first series.  Regarding GF and GA, the team's GA was third lowest in the Atlantic division and fifth lowest in the Eastern conference.  Sens struggled for offence most nights during the regular season (you can thank a bad PP for that). I'd have to review all the final game scores but I think they had quite a few low scoring wins and several losses where they got blown out.  As a fan I would have been more worried about that statistic had they scored a lot of goals and the differential was still negative.

The huge cut in the corporate tax rate will mostly flow back to wealthy shareholders and because the US taxes investment income at a lower rate than wage income, they’ll pay low tax rates on new income from Corp tax cuts. The bill will also eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is in place to ensure that wealthy people can’t use loopholes to avoid paying any tax at all. Republicans also plan to get rid of the estate tax, which right now is levied only on estates with values in excess of $5.5 million, meaning only rich heirs pay it on their inheritances. Trump, the lying conman, stands to personally gain millions, maybe hundreds of millions from the changes conservatives want to make to the tax code.

Handguns, the #1 murder weapon, were the subject of this decision. 2) Weapons not in common use, are not protected. 3) In order to be banned, a weapon must be both unusual and dangerous.  Since this ruling, most courts have simply ruled as if it did not exist - but other have used it to expand gun rights

Fox News is absolutely essential, the the blue collar Republican MUST live in the delusion of trickle down for the coalition to hang together.  In this election, the most astonishing thing is that the free trade deals Trump told the Republican blue collars were the cause of their pain, were pushed by the Republican wealthy.

The advocate therefore puts before the court the clients version, even if unlikely. Should the clients version however be so unlikely one expect the advocate to confront the client. If the client acknowledge that its version does not represent the truth the advocate would be in breach of his oath to present it to court knowing it is not the truth. In such case there can be no consequence for the advocate refusing to knowingly be party to misleading the court. If the client however insist that his version is the truth the advocate must present the case to the court. This is how I understand the issue.

God never punishes to destroy, but to restore.  We have a choice to accept this or not 3) Do you see Jesus' soul as a separate entity from his body and life? [how could Jesus suffer if he saw the Beatific Vision?]. 4) I stated that as the plot was thickening, Jesus could certainly perceive what the religious hierarchy was planning for him, and he certainly understood it perfectly in the Garden.  And yes, Jesus knew that this Cup of suffering would not pass from him. 5) God writes 'straight with all the crooked lines' that humanity uses.  On the Cross, the Trinity was present---Jesus, with faith and trust, offered his life and all that he did to the Father, and the Spirit infusing the Love/Forgiveness of God back to us.

0,"Gary, your analysis is both brilliant and obvious to those few of us who have been paying attention. Unfortunately...the shortage of comments in this space so far, and the lack of any politicians or media pundits ever putting such fundamental ideas into public discussion, suggest your plausible scenario is going up in smoke. Eminent domain to capture land and consolidate small parcels in the city, followed by construction of well-planned dense, affordable housing for residents is a no-brainer, but somehow our leaders don't get it. Instead they have been obsessed with wasting billions on rail and evicting homeless without providing livable places for poor people to go.  Our """"leaders"""" are afraid to offend big business and land-holding powers that yank their chains. Your one-shot essay in itself will do nothing.  The only way for your ideas to gain  traction is for you to run, run, run for governor. Hanaboo, Ige and others splitting the primary vote offers progressives a golden chance.

0,"""""...as Catholics, I do think we can and should look at everything differently....""""  Happy birthday, Michael.  I believe without a doubt that religions, including Catholicism, can provide a gateway to a more sensitive, aware, holy, and integrated way of being alive. I do doubt, however, whether any one particular religion can be that gateway for everyone. People vary in their temperamental constitution and in the experiences they have lived through and learned from. A religion that serves one person perfectly might be the wrong thing for another; it would not bring sensitivity, awareness, holiness, or integration, or it might bring them in a faltering way. I think it is good for us to be mindful of the truly substantive differences among us in terms of our spiritual needs and proclivities. Some people are Catholics for a valid reason. Some are heathens for a valid reason. Some are Protestants for a valid reason. Some fill their spiritual lives with music for a valid reason. And so on.

The key is that everyone follows the rules. Cyclists aren't racing in and out of traffic or pedestrians or running red or yellow lights,  but ride at a commuting speed, the same as the aforementioned mothers, pedestrians don't jaywalk or think that the equivalent of the flashing red hand means """"go"""", and cars defer to pedestrians and cyclists and don't run the equivalent of yellow lights.

0,"There is no question that better hygiene and sanitation along with better living conditions were instrumental in bringing down the number of cases of polio and diphtheria, but vaccination itself, finally, was probably responsible for dispatching the final blows to both diseases.  For example, the Red Cross estimated 200,000 cases of diphtheria in the former Soviet Union in 1998 due to a massive drop in vaccination rates resulting in 5000 deaths. In 1991, only 2,000 cases of diphtheria occurred in the USSR. In other words, the disease still exists and immunization is keeping it at bay.  Yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes. There is no cure only prevention through immunization. How successful are you in getting rid of all mosquitoes in your backyard in the summer?  Smallpox was spread via contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces, or exposure to aerosolized particles. There was no prevention except quarantine which explains why it was so deadly.

HAL has 20 Boeing 717s for their interisland routes, but I think they only use 14 of them for normal operations.  SW would also have to devote capital for a maintenance hanger, maintenance equipment, maintenance, ground and gate personnel, and gate and counter space.

Well we brought in and cared for some 30,000 Syrians, hired multiple nannies for Justin, paid for Justin's holidays, paid for the largest contingent of Canadians to attend the Paris conference to save the environment (note the humor in likely being the biggest polluters by flying so many for no added benefit to the taxpayers),  $400,000,000 to Bombardier (apparently to fund executive bonuses), and $600,000,000 to Ford both of which are really more Federal transfers to Ontario and Quebec that fly in the face of promoting a better environment (how would those Easterners feel if it was $1,000,000,000 to Suncor? - of course it's not cars or jets that pollute...).

AGDC under Parnell wasted at least $200million on bogus slick-hustler consultants studying how to build a stupid pipeline between Fairbanks and Nikiski ignoring the fact the railroad is already built. A simple quick and CHEAP flexpipe Stub2Hub between Deadhorse & FBX can immediately put AKRR to work hauling (2)-90car trainloads per day of LPG-propane for export to the premium Japan markets. LPG provides a much higher profit margin for Alaskans than LNG or stupid CRUDE. Currently all of our LPGpropane is called """"missable""""-injectant and is smuggled out with the CRUDE providing ZERO BENEFIT for Alaskans.

However, I do like blessings, giving thanks and benediction for what we have.   What is problematic in paeans is what is missing or not addressed.  Many have through the passing years commented on a topical avoidance of death and suffering allowed by an all loving God...how can this be despite the daily prayers and offerings.  So often it is proclaimed as one has avoided and escaped a disaster;  thank God.  But there are so many others not fortunate to have escaped.  This world is filled with pain and suffering a much heavier weight of burden than joys experienced.

Market mechanisms for benenfits are not, provided there is adequate income distribution to replace these programs, however I doubt the capitalists are suggesting that.  Solidarity will fix the problems of internationalism, but only if employee-owned firms go global and work in solidarity with their counterparts in the global supply chain. Sadly, few talk about that. That solidarity also makes technology safe for the planet, allowing for the building of individual habitats to grow food and stop corporate agriculture and the development of fusion power to end global warminng.

After you read it, go back and read it again and again until not only do you understand what Jesus commanded of you, but until you put his commandment into practice.  If you cannot do so, or willfully refuse to, please do not call yourself a Christian because regardless of what ISIS is or stands for, Jesus did not condone what Ms. Peterson is suggesting.  As for me, I am Christian and faithfully try to follow all of Jesus' teachings; this doesn't make me better than anyone else as I fail somewhere along the way each day but try with Grace to go forward and amend myself daily.

When we send our kids to private school we also help fund a public school system while not using a dime of it. The property tax we pay for one house is more than three houses that are valued at our one house when added together but use 3 times the resources, roads etc. Anyone that know the tax laws of this Country also know there are no tax loop holes left. The main one being a receipt that we can claim for donating money to a registered charity. Capital gains are already taxed just not at income levels but the money used to buy the stock was taxed money. How many times should one $ be taxed? If you want to be outraged go after the foreign buyers flipping real estate that they list as their primary residence when they don't even live in the country and don't pay a dime in tax upon the sale. The problems of this country are not because the 1% dont pay enough tax😳

Managing a shelter is far cry from managing a colony of feral cats. Your shelter sounds like death row for cats. Those who do care and manage stray (abandon/unwanted) cats know that without TNRM the problem would be 20 times worse than it is.  Do the math; If using Mr. Eagle's false estimate of 300,000 free roaming cats on Oahu, let's assume half of them are female and fertile.  So if we have 150,000 female and fertile cats, and if every one of those female cats had an average of 10 litters in a five year period (with an average of 5 kittens per,  then an estimated 7.5 million cats would be roaming free on Oahu in five years.  Because of TNRM, over 100 thousand cats have been neutered and returned to their colonies in that same 5 year span.  Again do the math, and the next time you want to spout off how TNRM doesn't work, get a calculator.

The minister and SASSA must tell SAPO in which areas they doubt their capacities and what evidence is required to allay their doubts - she can't just rush to issue tenders on the assumption that SAPO does not have sufficient capacity.

Some, if not all, of the average differences could be due to socialization rather than biology, several experts said.""""  And then the article goes on to list many examples of said socialization, in terms of math, reading, science and tech: """" ... more patriarchal societies show a much larger gap in these test scores, while egalitarian cultures show only a tiny gap, he added. That suggests that culture, rather than brain differences, explains most of the gap, he added.""""

I was a science student with little interest in such things up to that point, but he really inspired in me an appreciation of classic literary works by Thomas Hardy, James Joyce and others. I did not know him personally outside of the classes of that single semester, but I remember a couple of occasions when he offered his words of encouragement and praise regarding my writing and his expectations of me for the future, and I have carried them with me through the years as a personal touchstone. He likely doesn’t remember me, but I was, in no small way, impacted by him as I am sure were countless others. I am deeply sorry to hear of his untimely passing.

Oh well, those who work for government unions and collect welfare for a living will be celebrating - but then again, the bedrock of any strong economy is bloated public sector union entitlements. And $15/hr minimum wage so companies can layoff 30% of their workforce (BC's unemployment is too low anyway) - but at least the welfare will be up for the laid-off employees.

0,"Sorry, but a progressive income tax is not a 'fair' tax within any determination of the descriptor.  One either pays unto a 'fair' tax, or one does not.  'Fair' as within its term, means an equatable garnishment from all taxation by all individuals that retain services within said tax.  Therefore, the only 'fair' tax is not a progressive income tax, unto which only a minority of wage earners pay unto said tax, supporting a majority that does not, but is a tax upon sales, so that all may, equally, pay unto what they themselves purchase.  Of course, that said, there is no need of ANY tax, within this regard, should the supposed lawmakers within Juneau, hidden away within their own enclave, actually do their own jobs, and represent the citizens of this State, rather than represent their own self interests.  Budget unto the current price of oil, and cut everything else off as fat, which of course they shall not do, as fat, well, is their own lifeblood.  They are leeches.  Nothing more.

So while poverty is detrimental to kids, it is no explanation as to why Oregon is so bad off in terms of graduation rate - sloppy thinking on your part.   Your attitude of living life to the fullest is representative of why Oregon's dropout rate is so high.  Achievement requires commitment and willingness to forgo living life to the fullest and instead doing boring schoolwork.  Preach maximal fulfillment to kids and many with drop out to have fun and live on the streets.  Who wants to put their nose to the grindstone to achieve if life is to be lived to the fullest.  Some of us believe that life is given to us so that we can achieve and leave something, a mark, that is seen as good.  It drove me to the best schools and a PhD.

JPII and BXVI tried to close the door on the Holy Spirit speaking inside the patriarchal/hierarchal structure of Church.  Of course, that doesn't really work, not in the long run.  And, there were some inside that structure who did not close themselves off to the Holy Spirit and tens of millions of the faithful who continued to listen to the Spirit.  Doctrine developed over 2000 years and will continue to develop.  Our understanding of creation and the Creator grows.  Confusion and ambiguity are conditions of being human.  God is not orthodoxy.

They would have to be idiots to not know exactly who the shooter was.  Yes, more time will be spent viewing the tapes to ensure other people were not involved.  However, there would be no delay in know exactly who the shooter was.  Now, let's assume that they only had one person working to view security footage (an unlikely scenario).  They still know exactly which camera to check first.  That's pretty obvious.  It should have also been obvious exactly who the shooter was.

Most of the callers clearly had a good idea of the Syria crisis: the real causes, the reality, the problem of western-backed/Saudi-backed Islamist violence/terrorism, etc.  Totally different information from callers to CBC Cross Country Checkup than what we receive in CIA/CBC news/fake-news broadcasts every day.  I think it's time a lot of so-called liberals in Canada and USA admitted that their support for regime-change in Syria, i.e. support for Islamist terrorists such as ISIS and al-Quaida, was based on propaganda...and they (most of them) fell for this propaganda hook, line & sinker. They should be ashamed of that.

The idea that a swinging pendulum is the equal and opposite reaction to a ball weighing 1000 trillion metric tons and rotating faster than the speed of sound, traveling 67,000 mi per hr. around the sun is dubious.  The model has been revised over and over with many theoretical forces added to account for what is observed (dark matter, dark energy).

It would effectively create two Palestinian states which is why the Palestinians insist on it.  Consider what happened to the Jews in other Arab countries. Where are they now?  The settlements would likely be given up if the Palestinians were serious about peace. Israel did this in Gaza and got the Hamas Charter as a reward. Besides, the Palestinians were committing acts of terror against Israel prior to 1967.  Arab-Israelis enjoy full rights including local Sharia law within Israel.  Ask any of them if they would prefer living in another Arab country or the West Bank. The Druze in the Golan Heights readily admit their life is much better in Israel than in Syria.  BDS is viewed as simple antisemitism by the average Israeli and is having no real effect on Israel's economy. It is affecting the Palestinian economy however.  Good luck with that.

For one, the bankruptcies of various parts of his business were, by and large, the result of a fall in the real estate market, and a decline in gaming in Atlantic City.  Only once was it the result of a bad economic decision, and that was when he purchased the Plaza Hotel - a decision he recognized was bad, but that was made out of emotion and love for the hotel.  Furthermore, the bankruptcies were all within the law, and designed to keep the businesses operating and people employed, which would not have been the case had bankruptcy not been sought; real people would have lost their jobs.  Also, in each bankruptcy, Trump was required to surrender assets and ownership stakes worth considerable amounts of money.  So, the claim that he """"personally profited at everyone else's expense"""" is an obvious lie.

HB 247, which the legislature passed, eliminated credits in Cook Inlet (65 % percent of the credits go to companies operating outside the North Slope), imposed an oil tax on Cook Inlet, and raised the tax rate on new North Slope fields. This bill will save the state billions and will generate additional revenue. The effort to find a balanced and sensible approach to oil taxes and credits was led by republicans.

0,"Well, I am glad that some folks out there are thinking about helping ex-cons get a chance at making it outside of prison.  They talk about recidivism, but the way we treat ex-cons generally, they have little recourse but to fall back into the dark side.  With nearly universal background checks and non-hiring based thereon, an ex-con has little recourse except to sit on a street corner with a sign.  With the exception of murderers, I personally, believe that after a first prison term, records should be expunged so that the dude has a chance to make it as a contributing citizen, get a job, and settle down.

0,"Both of the foster daughters were young adults at the time and had already had kids plus abortions. My point was that while a project like the Colorado one or even the great access teens have here in Alaska as well as """"poor women"""", there are the pregnant teens and adults who repeatedly get pregnant not because of lack of birth control or education but because they have an emotional need that they think can be met by having a child. It's not a put down on them it's realizing that some girls and women have repeated pregnancies because of emotional needs of their own. There are girls and women who get pregnant due to other circumstances, religious or cultural, do not use birth control. They have fewer options because birth control or sex is forbidden. But a far great problem is kids were prenatally exposed to alcohol and/or drugs. Two of the three kids we adopted were born with the effects of prenatal exposure. Their mother was born prenatally exposed as was her mother. 3 generations !

Today thanks to government raising taxes, tobacco competes with pot as one of the largest black market smuggled products in America. Tobacco is also a billion dollar mom and pops, along with many terrorist organizations and organized crime syndicates involved, black market today as well. New York City is the biggest payday, millions in profit just for one smuggled truck load of cigarettes today!

0,"Well-said by the G & M. And good for John Kerry and the Democrats. But they're all decades too late.  There's always been a parallel about the homelessness of the Palestinians and the homelessness of Canadians on our streets. One is the result of a bad international war, the other is a result of the class war against the poor underclasses. Building settlements in the West Bank precludes a home for Palestinians; razing old cheap housing and condominium gentrification in Canada preclude a home for Canadians living on our streets. The refusal of the US and Israel to negotiate a state for Palestinians parallels the refusal of Canadian governments to supply sufficient stocks of affordable housing. Both serve the purpose of the wealthy powerful Establishment by scaring low-income people into submission to injustice, This announcement by Kerry seems like a sad afterthought decades late but welcome nonetheless.

The 13th Cavalry  commander launched a spirited defense of Columbus NM when 1500 Mexicans under Pancho Villa attacked in search of supplies.  Col Slocum even authorized a squadron under Major Tompkins to pursue Villa into Mexico, providing a foreshadowing of the Punitive Expedition under Gen Pershing.

It is to his enormous credit that he got any bill even approaching universal health care, which is, or ought to be, a human right, through our bloody-minded and pandering Congress.  """"That would have taken a lot longer..(with) no guarantee of success."""" Exactly right. You have hindsight, but Obama had foresight, knowing that he had only a small temporal window in which to accomplish that great step forward, which has extended health care coverage to 24 million people who had never had it before. Now, you and too many people in power want to take that away. You should be ashamed.

When asked why he was running much higher deficits than he promised during the 2015 election campaign, Trudeau said: “If you actually want to do the math, we talked about $10 billion worth of deficit in our first year. It became $30 billion. But there were still only about $10 billion or $11 billion worth of new spending. It was the economic situation that fell out.” Actually, the current backcast for the 2016-17 deficit is $23B, but Trudeau is probably too clueless to know this. Anyway, his contention that only the deterioration of the economic situation kept him from fulfilling his promise is groundless.

Any teaching of the church or tradition can be referred to as a dogma but most can be changed and many have been.  Your highly defensive final statement regarding women being ordained priests is proof you are not convinced yourself that this rule excluding women from priesthood can't be changed.  And definitely proof Christ wanted women discriminated against is necessary to continue excluding women because otherwise we sin continually and continue to weaken.  There is no proof Christ desired Bishops to treat or ordain women any differently than men so we do sin while we continue this bias.  And the Gospels are my proof.

I know it bothers people to hear the unvarnished truth, but I'd sooner be the bearer of inconvenient truths than the purveyor of comforting falsehoods.  What I have written is true and verifiable. Macroeconomics is far more complex than people realize, and far more subtle. There is indeed a time for the Keynesian approach, and we are in such a time in Canada.  On the other hand, that time has passed in the US, so the idea of deficit financed economic stimulus in the form of infrastructure investment is sheer folly. The US needs a dose of Hayek and a freeing up of the markets at a time when the government there is getting too hands on.  It's ok to disagree, but for now I'm going to claim the authority on this matter since I see little else here that speaks to sound countervailing economic theory.  Most disagreements here seem to be based on a dislike of Trudeau rather than anything I'd consider rational.

In addition to walking his district, he randomly calls constituents on the phone, to stay in touch and see if everything is okay or if they need assistance. In the Downtown/Chinatown area he works with private companies and government agencies to reduce noise pollution, a serious health issue in this area.

I am sure the state agency knew of this law but decided with reason to allow the city to do it in phases, which would allow the city to start construction.  so to say that the city totally ignored the state law is totally erroneous and false.  a good judge would look at the facts and rule based on the reasonableness of the issue and if there was any evil intent.  if no, the judges should come to a reasonable conclusion to mitigate any damage as a result of their decision.  this the judges did not do. their misguided decision cost the city a lot of money.  further kaleikini did not really have a standing in bringing the lawsuit.

That money should go into public goods like education, the arts, healthcare, basic research and infrastructure. Something has to be done about child poverty as well.

We are discussing what the Senate is being asked to do as an institution, regardless of which party controls the House of Commons. As Mr. Harder construes it, the Senate in its role as the chamber of sober second thought is primarily advisory. House of Commons bills go to the Senate, which tidies them up, makes detail changes, and if it appears that the House has acted in a burst of excessive and unwise enthusiasm, delays until the fervor dies down. It is not the job of the Senate to force change, but rather to push the House of Commons to rethink.

You don't like Trump's presidency? Fine. Be civilly disobedient. Protest your angst against the government all the way to the White House.  Know this though... that the moment you do anything other than to stand at attention and render reverence to the Flag and our national anthem when the bugle sounds, is the moment that liberty dies.

And also amend the laws such that illegal sales are linked to tax evasion etc.  i.e. increase the measure of the crime.

Conservatives have a floor of 25% and ceiling of 40% (unless they breakthrough in Quebec whereby the ceiling rises to 50%) while for the NDP, unless they breakthrough in Quebec, their floor is 10% and ceiling 20% so if the Conservatives chose a moderate like Chong or Raitt, depending on how Trudeau does they might get near the ceiling, but if they choose an ideologue like Leitch or Trost they will probably be closer to the floor as will the NDP due to strategic voting.

I order for schools to truly be allowed to compete and function in a market-based system, then here's what needs to happen:  1) Get rid of compulsory education.  If you're so hot on choice, then you should include the option of not going to school at all.  2) Allow ALL schools to reject substandard raw materials (i.e. students that have no desire to be at school, those that lack natural ability, etc.).

0,"Mr. Dobbs, since China is basically exempted from the Paris agreement, how are they a big part of it outside of agreeing to their low standards?  In fact, the U.S. is already a leader in renewable energies. Europe simply is much more permissive in nuclear power usage, as is Japan, than the U.S. is. The world's two largest polluters, China, and India, which has favorable terms in the Paris agreement, are nowhere close to being held to the same standard as we are. We'd also have to subsidize other countries while taking a hit ourselves.  Why? When a utility is goverment owned, upgrades can be slow. When they're privately owned, the company is fast to upgrade, charge it to taxpayers, and profit off of the upgrades. XCEL, for example, makes over half it's profits from their Colorado residents, despite them being a multi-state energy company.  Is it possible Merkel's displeased due to the loss of subsidies? Our country will not stop making improvements in the absence of an agreement.

Human rights legislation is as flawed as any other laws. You only need to look at some of the decisions of the human rights tribunal which are wacky in the extreme. And it is because human rights are the legal Holy Grail, not to be questioned and to be worshiped above all else that injustices occur. Human rights cannot be separated from society and its values because if you were the last human on earth you would have no rights at all. They are defined by society and if that leads to decisions that are unjust, the laws need to be revisited. Like it or not, the people think this stinks, and it is they who decide on the laws of society, not lawyers.

An apology, maybe was justified, but Kahdr's father and family put him into this situation.

Trudeau should have let the courts decide whatever compensation might have had to be given, but Trudeau's expediency to resolve this issue seems like a rush to get this matter 'swept under the carpet' and hopefully forgotten by the time the next election rolls round.

0,"Measurement in the health care system is a double edged sword. On one side the information that results can help make better decisions. However, healthcare is laden with subjective human experience and intangibles which massively impact the data in unpredictable ways and can severely damage its value. Secondly, the collection of data is a labour intensive process, one which I suspect accounts for a significant portion of the 28.3% of the hospital budget. More data is not the answer, carefully measuring the correct information in a controlled environment is.  If I was setting up a measurement system, I would restrict most data measurement to specific study hospitals that were designed to be research intensive. The vast majority of hospitals do have neither the personnel or resources to do that now, meaning most of the data collected from them is often meaningless.

1,"You clearly do not understand French society and culture. In France, just as in Quebec (Canada) mass attendance does not accurately describe Catholic identity. Being Catholic refers to a much deeper sense of identity than showing up on Sundays.  The French have significantly more common sense about social issues than populations of other countries manipulated by political correctness.  France was one of the first countries allowing same-sex unions, but it (the population) was consistently against same-sex marriage. French sensitivity for life issues got it right. Marriage is something unique, and as it is clearly indicated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is not an absolute right.  Hollande, the typical dumb ideologue, by sheer power, forced the redefinition of marriage on the people. He and his party got what he deserved: 6% support.

Yes, all campaigns will make errors and there are many ways to point blame when one loses. However, I think the meddling of a foreign govt. is a different and much more insidious issue. This is an issue that threaten our democracy. The mishaps of a candidate or their campaign are not. We must come together to confront what threatens our election process.  Pan, being fair is difficult and, I believe, not fully possible, but we have to try. If not it won't be any hostile foreign govt. that will destroy our country, it we be our very selves.

Then the county again has to waste the tax payers time and money by more serious crime to be sent to prison while the police and the county attorney, district judge presiding the case along with the great public pretenders office works against defendants... So the question why add more charges to send someone to prison??? Lets ask chief kerns why he thinks its ok to allow his officers to stack on bogus charges... Lets ask ourselfs the conmunity would the late Ofc.Chris Kilcullen allow this miscarriage of justice to continue... I think not we need to get new officers in the department who cares...

The tax break that goes to the wealthy will amount to $187,000 per year on average. It will not only cut a lot of people out of insurance and reduce the benefits you currently get, it will reduce the tax revenue going to Medicare (it was in the ACA which is being cancelled including the tax revenue measure).

0,"Sure, Doc, the same numbers as historically would be fine!. But they are using the open 10-year visas, birth tourism, investor-class spots, and students to take a larger share of our immigration target than the system intends.  People from South, Central and S.E. Asia, Latin America, E. Europe, and especially Africa don't have an equal shot at getting in here because they simply don't have as much money.  So, do the economic measures to return the property market back to reality - but you also have to cut back all these methods by which people queue-jump the immigration system.  Provide funding to get students from Africa, etc., since not many can afford the triple tuition.  Nuke the investor programs, enforce all tax laws with no reference to ethnicity (but don't shy away because of it!), end the 10-year visas.

So I am and will be a witness who is loud in my protest of it. To many white people, my loud protest, by itself, is called “reverse racism.” So, to many I am a racist just because I protest.  Whites can’t be witnesses against such things because they don’t know what racism and bigotry from other whites feels like. So even a little protest is seen as a monstrous act of reverse racism. They can empathize. They can march. They can voice vocal protests. And that’s all good. It needs to be done.  So even in the face of racist killings in our country and bigotry of the Trump kind, whites have to drum up the courage to make a stand against something they can't and don't and won't understand. People of color already have that kind of courage because it is a built-in mechanism for survival in America as we know it.

0,"Virtually all the railroad track between Anchorage and the MATSU is at or has a lower speed limit than the roads.  A train on that section of track will not get you there quicker. The diesel cars you mention came from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.  They were maintenance nightmares, not capable of speeds of modern locomotives and not suited for cold weather. It is a fact that every passenger service requires a subsidy (ie, operating costs above operating revenue). If customers had to shoulder operating costs through ticket prices there would be no passenger trains.  Seems to me that state support of the Alaska Railroad in whatever form benefits all citizens using railroad services.

Compared to for profits, there are no differences in health outcomes or satisfaction experiences among patients. Also, nonprofit hospitals serve larger range of patients and offer more health services, even those that private orgs consider nonprofitable (i.e. mental health). 2. The VA is an example of an universal health care system, not single payer (at least not the U.S. type of single payer). In the VA, the govt serves as the sole payer and provider of all services. In the """"American single payer system"""", or more commonly known as Medicare for All, the government would pay for all health services but delivery of care (hospitals and providers) would remain largely private. 3. Over the years, more providers have been accepting Medicare. In fact, reimbursing providers at Medicare rates (75% of commercial rates) allows them to continue making very high salaries, albeit reduced.

0,"UA penchant for excessive administration has come home to roost.  Even when UA claimed in the 1990's that it was merging the community colleges into the 3 branches to reduce CC administration, it lied.   CC presidents were retitled directors usually with pay increases.  At the same time all administrators at dean level and above  got huge pay increases.  The pay for deans went from about 68k to 92k -- the former level of chancellors. Everyone above dean got similar jumps.  Even worse was that over the following years an already bloated administration grew even more with more administration levels added  Greedy administrators have finally caused the disaster they started.

Clearly your not a parent, as a father I can tell you that if a child twice my child's age attacked my child and the child's mother told me to fuck off I would bitch slap her no matter what her race, and if my son hit a girl in the face and the parent confronted me, my son would be on the receiving end of my anger not the parent. Had the mother done the right thing and taken her son to task for the bullying this matter would never have occurred thus SHE is the guilty one.

You are telling a GOVERNMENT to step in and RESTRICT with the market economy, don’t you understand? That’s a dangerous slippery slope.  Instead of giving the government arbitrary power to meddle with the economy, why don’t you ask for stronger laws against REAL ISSUES like elder abuse.

0,"More impactful than those seniors bumped over the top of GIS are those who will receive substantially less GIS due to higher CPP payments.  GIS gets clawed back at 50 cents on the dollar. Then they might have to pay tax on that CPP, or they might have their GST/HST credits clawed back, or have their Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit clawed back (for Ontario seniors, other Provinces may have similar credits), or possibly have their GAINS clawed back, or whatever.  The net benefit of the expanded CPP for low income seniors is almost certain to be well under 50 cents for every dollar of contributions.  On the flip side their tax reduction while working was probably only 20 cents on the dollar and the accrued benefit probably only adds up to 20 to 30 cents.  ... or, put another way, low income seniors would literally be better off stuffing their money under their mattress.

This issue also divides Israel, as hardliners want to continue to land grab while those who seek a peaceful solution want them stopped. We have long supported Israel - blindly even - and have looked past transgressions and their obstacles to peace because we want them to succeed and bring some sort of western normalty to the middle east - but 50 years later they still have been unable to make that peaceful assemblance with the Palestenians.

Although the proportional approach might initially seem to offer the possibility of making every voter in every state equal and relevant in presidential elections, it would not do this in practice.  The system sharply increases the odds of no candidate getting the majority of electoral votes needed, leading to selection by the U.S. House of Representatives, regardless of the popular vote anywhere.  It would not accurately reflect the nationwide popular vote;  It would reduce the influence of any state, if not all states adopted.  It would not improve upon the current situation in which four out of five states and four out of five voters in the country are ignored by campaigns. It would create a very small set of states in which only one electoral vote is in play (while making most states politically irrelevant),  It would not guarantee the Presidency to the candidate with the most popular votes in the country.

One couldn't deal with it and committed suicide.  Many of us, also, have made mistakes, failed.  But looking at those mistakes, owning them, and working untiringly to do better---the horrible experiences of our own errors CAN make us better.  Let's hope that all of these mistakes made in the past will grant true compunction of heart and wisdom to those who must root out the terrible abuses of the past [and present], render justice to the accused and for the victims, and set into place actual, tangible results to protect the young.

It was right here in the comments section of Willamette Week that Lukens declared he was a Libertarian.  But he wasn't a true Libertarian.  He was a corporate shill for Portland Business Alliance and the paper's advertisers.   His many editorials unthinkingly supporting a $3 to $4 billion  Columbia River Crossing, a government project, would not have been written by a true Libertarian.   Lukens was also, like Christian Anderson, a bully.  He told Brad Avakian in an editorial interview  that he would destroy Avakian's political career.   Whether or not you are a Democrat or Republican, that's not the way you want the Oregonian editorial editor to bully people around.    Lukens felt bully-like after he helped to end Jefferson Smith's candidacy for Mayor, and virtually ran Charlie Hales from office.   He can help take the Bulletin down.

Trump condemned them.  3) Authorities and police which did not do their jobs.  The authorities should have ordered the police to separate the the groups.  Instead, tragically, the police were ordered to stand down while the extremists fought.

But that aside in the written Gospels Christ is very clear about adultery being prohibited and since the very early days of the Church (as reflected in St. Paul's letters)  this has included all forms of unchastity, including homosexual acts.  Naturally Christ didn't use the word """"homosexuality"""" as the word and the concept (of an inclination toward this being somehow constitutive) are products of modern fads.  But even searching for prohibitions or excusing sin by reference to absence in the New Testament is wrong and un-Christian.  Christianity isn't Islam or Judaism founded on a book that lists naughty and nice things to do. We avoid these things--and remember that the ancients considered homosexual relations a universal temptation--and all sins because they are contrary to love of God and love of neighbor.

As for the deficits and debt? More nonsense. Trudeau and Mulroney both dealt with interest and inflation rates that far greater than Harper (in some cases 10 times larger).

You are correct in stating that electrical energy is a small part of current global energy consumption. However, electrical energy will become more important as we move forward. The reasons for this are varied. Computers and data centers are using more power. The sales of EVs, starting from a small base, are doubling about every 20 months and, in a growing number of cases, people are starting to charge their EVs using power generated on their own roof tops.  Solar power is hundreds of times cheaper now than it was in 1980 and the price will continue to drop. Storage costs, lithium ion batteries and so on, continue to drop.

1,"Blacks are always suspect and can be shot on sight by police for mere suspicion of being armed. This happens in even open carry states. It happens hundreds of times a year nation wide. Many criminals get their guns by way of gun shows in red states, sometimes using """"straw"""" purchasers. The NRA has helped facilitate these sales by fighting every gun control law. For example, most guns in Chicago are bought in Indiana where the gun laws are much more lax than in Chicago. BTW, The NRA even fights research into why we have so many gun deaths. The police live in  fear because they know there are enough guns in the population for every man, woman, and child.

And, given that just about everything I propose gets a sad face from you, why do you invite me to propose something about an evil lunatic.? I can only continue to do what I've always done, not go to Las Vegas, or Chicago, or Orlando, or Charlotte, or San Bernardino, etc. They have enough problems without me getting involved in their mess.

0,"The whole idea that Catholic hospitals can disregard laws enacted to help the working person and the working poor (look at some of the hospital wages) is immoral. That the Becket group filed a friend of the court argument and was probably partially funded by the K of C is also immoral. Makes me want to avoid Catholic Hospitals from here on out. Good Lord, what is the Church thinking?
"
0,"Not necessarily. 6 inches of dry soil won't retain moisture the same as 18 inches of soil a bit moist.  Detention ponds flood. A contained roof, with no drainage or with reduced drainage capabilities, will flood. Heavy rainfalls flooding the streets, or several days of heavy rain, will increase the probability roofs under this requirement may end up with problems. I saw it, on one green roof downtown, with several inches of standing water.  It seriously makes more sense to have surface level vegetation, especially trees that can reduce heat on concrete or pavement, and use light materials instead on roofs. Many pavement parking lots don't have trees producing shade and reducing surface heat.

Every Scientific Academy has reviewed the history of the planet and the changes that have occurred now with unusual speed, matching the speed of the Industrial Revolution.  Not one single academy of sciences holds a different position.  Science is evidence based.  We must change to recycle, reuse, re-purpose and rapidly switch to non fossil fuel energy sources, including trucks and trains in all of the world.  New industries will move the economies forward unless the government refuses to embrace the technologies.  Those countries will be the new poor countries.

0,"When ballistic missiles are launched in the general direction of North America, it is nearly impossible to determine if their target will be Seattle, or Vancouver, Toronto or Detroit, and so on, since most targets in Canada are close to the US border.  And in general the ability of anyone to """"hit a bullet with a bullet"""" has been disputed, but this is not like Iraq firing Scuds at Israel, if a country fires more than one missile it might still be hard to know what it is or what the intention is with enough time to react, and a country with as many missiles as Russia or China would be able to overwhelm and missile defense system.  Canada, as a member of Norad and Nato, is already in a relationship with the US that commits them to come to our defense. Who is going to fire one or two nuclear missiles at Canada, and why?  In short, our participation had little practical benefit for our defense, was unlikely to work, and sent the wrong message to the world.

0,"Interesting viewpoint. Last week in this newspaper the state legislator said the current prison population in this state is busting the state budget yet some say here that addicts who have committed no crimes should go to prison because federal """"tax"""" money should not be used to treat addictions. The point that I am making is that addiction is a huge financial burden on society, some addicts do not hold jobs, they get divorced, do not support their kids and sell drugs and commit crimes to get money to fuel their addiction and tie up our court system which costs a lot of state money. So no matter how society deals with addicts they costs a lot of money to the communities and the states they live in. Better to spend my tax money on treating them and giving them an opportunity to live a useful life rather than spend decades in the """"system"""" on the state dime.  I know addicts who have been treated and they do reclaim their lives, it happens all the time.

Perhaps one of the reasons you seem unaware of this is that they deliberately attempted to sink a US intelligence vessel in international waters, and murder the survivors as they took to their lifeboats, to cover up their mobilization for perhaps their biggest unprovoked attack, the six-day war against Egypt and Syria.  And our own traitorous leaders then attempted to cover up this heinous war crime by our """"ally in the middle-east"""".

0,"http://barnhardt.biz/  On Francis Posted by Ann Barnhardt - March 14, AD 2013 10:34 AM MST Let me start with a positive comment. Remember, this is the best I could come up with: If we had gotten the pope we DESERVE, we would now have Pope Snoop Dogg.  And thus ends the positivity.  Francis, like his homeland of Argentina, is a total disaster. He has overseen the near-total destruction of the Church in Argentina. He hates and despises the Tridentine Mass, which is to say that he hates the Mass - let's not mince words, and is a rabid persecutor of anyone in Argentina who shows ANY signs of tradition. A priest in Argentina literally risks the end of his career if he wears a cassock in public. He has forbidden the Tridentine Mass in Argentina, which is an act of direct disobedience, specifically against the papal decree Summorum Pontificum, but embraces horrific """"charismatic"""" and """"Superfun Rockband""""-type liturgical sacrilege.

0,"It's lovely to see the partisan divide continuing on this thread. Just to point out that EVERY administration since Woodrow Wilson created the domestic spy agencies has aggressively controlled the information that the American people have access to and they have jailed those who have leaked that information. Hillary Clinton would have been just as harsh as Trump is being, as Obama and Bush were, as ... well, just keep going back and back and back.  This story shouldn't be so much about the content of the leak or the leaker herself, but about the Deep State and all the information they are and have been keeping from us that we have a right to know. That's what really ought to concern us.  Instead, you draw up in your partisan lines and hurl invective at one another, insisting that if """"the other party"""" was in charge this wouldn't be happening. Yes, it would, because it has and will continue unless we the people choose to stop it. This is not how you do that.

0,"I mentioned one case- that I know of.  Saying """"clergy"""" is neutral - it does not give a number because I do not know. The author states with some surprise the many Catholic woman, against personal interest, support Trump - I gave a plausible hypothesis - and a clue to something that should be investigated further, that is if the RCC had interest of stopping such shameful behavior. Many readers of the NCR have lived through similar """"indoctrination"""" at the hands of clergy, and grew up to regret the unfortunate incident. It is one experience that unite us. It is an experience that makes it credible that the experience of this one woman may reflect a trend of some clergy - be it by directly saying the name Trump or by not so subtle allusions. We all know about the wafer wars -another  shameful incident - Priests can NOT judge people, either can you. I will not explain again.

The study of school wells can be found here   https://public.health.oregon.gov/HealthyEnvironments/DrinkingWater/SourceWater/Pages/pdp-schools.aspx There were 22 schools in the State of Oregon that had their wells tested.  The purpose of this sampling project was to collect data on the national prevalence of pesticides and pesticide breakdown products in school well water. Participation in this project was voluntary and analytical results were provided to participating schools. The data collected in this project will be used for national research and risk assessments of these chemicals to specifically address the drinking water component for children during their developmental years. The data will be published by the USDA. The summary described and reported on the collective test results in Oregon.  CONCLUSION   None of the pesticides or their breakdown products were found at levels of concern for public health.

The commission is hauling in millions in income, but it's 14 years later and we still don't have a gasline because Big Oil and the Republican majority are blocking the 14-year-old initiative without a fight from the voters.  Secondly, voters also passed a ballot measure to tax the cruise ship passengers a $50 head tax, but when Parnell was voted into office, and in the first six months, he flew to Florida and met with the cruise ship CEOs and pledge to not only roll back the head tax, but water down Alaska's Clean Water legislation.  Apparently governors can do what they want with citizens' initiatives without a voter fight.  And don't forget that it was the Republican majority that passed legislation years ago upping the ante on making it more difficult for voters to collect signatures.

The 'fat cats'  with incomes between $103,000 and $137,000 a year can easily suck up the $751 less they will get per year.  """"It's fer the childrun"""".  (And the Portland, Salem, Eugene, Lane County,  University bureaucrats and other Union members this bill was designed to pay off for being Union members, at the expense of the rest of us.  The Unions have always known  that this tax will be passed through to the consumer.  My grocery store example tells it all.   When all the grocery stores have the same in-State profit margin, they would be stupid not to pass it on.

In fact, many of the new deal programs were almost identical to fascist programs from Germany and Italy because FDR used them as models for his own programs. By the way, fascist is a term that Mussolini and his group created in Italy in the early 30's and that FDR widely approved of and admired.

It would be great if everyone would disarm!  But the only way to make that happen is for the powerful to make it so, and if we disarm first, we lose that chance.

This strategy works every time and why?

What I use the full service broker for is access to the firm's investment research reports.  I have no interest in doing that sort of work myself.  So I consider trading commissions as the price I pay for access to the research, and the broker I have been dealing with for many years knows me well enough to bring appropriate stuff to my attention.   I use the discount broker for things I own/buy without wanting research input etc. from a broker - low trading costs are a relevant issue on these holdings.

That theory just doesn't hold water... there is no truth to it. Julian Assange (WikiLeaks) has stated that the e-mails did not come from the Russians... there's no incentive whatsoever for him to lie about that. Interestingly...

0,"The big mistake the government made was its failure to dismantle the National Energy Board immediately after its election and setting up a new NEB located in Ottawa rather than Calgary. In Calgary, the NEB was a captive of industry and not an independent regulator.  For details, see the resignation letter of Robyn Allan, an economist and intervenor in the Kinder Morgan NEB process. The link is:  https://dogwoodinitiative.org/robyn-allan-withdraws  One of the reasons for approving Line 3 is its age which is over 50 years as well as increasing pipeline capacity.  With the transmountain pipeline, the existing pipeline has been operating since 1953. If the Liberal government believed it had to approve the Transmountain proposal, it should have had the assessment done for the full capacity of the new pipeline and it should have ordered the ancient pipeline now in use to be shut down as soon as the new pipeline had been completed. It still would’ve increased capacity but not as much.

Is it legal for the state to take retirement benefits now from employees who were promised benefits as part of their compensation, and then worked for 30 years,  having planned their financial lives and their old age based on the retirement contract they made with their employer? The Court has said """"no"""" to that very consistently. In my book, it would also be unfair and unjust. It seems to me absolutely right to uphold those contracts.  So what are we arguing about? We should be arguing about what kind of state we are going to have, how we are going to pay our bills, and how we are going to build a future.

And they remember that Obama cut them right out of even any inputs or information on the Iran Nuclear Deal which puts Israel in great peril.

0,"Planned Parenthood keeps the doors open through government grants for providing contraception and female health services. Take those grants away and they cannot afford to provide abortions. Therefore, those grants are funding abortions.  Planned Parenthood can keep those grants if it agrees to stop providing abortions. Since it won't do that, those grant dollars can go to the many organizations that offer those contraception and female health services but do not perform abortions. I know of at least two here in Fairbanks. I'd bet there are a half-dozen to a dozen in Anchorage.  Problem solved. My tax dollars are no longer funding murder. A private doctor can take payment to abort babies. That's his/her choice and those of us who consider abortion to be murder are not paying for it, so our opinion is just that, an opinion.  If you don't want me to stand against your lifestyle, don't ask me to participate in it.

0,"The Church does not think women are inferior.  You incorrectly infer that from the fact that the priesthood is restricted to men.  Read Edith Stein, and you may come to a different understanding.  As for sensus fidelium changing, my position stands:  The exclusion of women from the priesthood was the accepted sensus fidelium, sanctioned by the Holy Spirit.  If it implied the inferiority of women, then that was sanctioned by the Holy Spirit.   Do you really contend that?  Or do you contend what is far more reasonable:  That there is no stigma of inferiority in the Church's seeing an ontological difference between men and women, and giving to men the role of """"father.""""

One of the main reasons why Bush Sr suckered Iraq into invading Kuwait was to get Iraqi oil off the market to bail out the bankrupt former USSR and get money flowing there before their nukes ended up on the black market, and bonus dude, it bailed out Mexico that saw runaway inflation turn their peso from 30 to $1 to 3000 to $1. Reaganomics 101 had more to do with trickle up than anything, but we'll debate that on another issue.

Deputy District Attorney Zoe Smith is “on board” with “the anti-politically correct movement to support Trump,” Smith wrote recently on her Facebook page. She added, “If you’re looking for a terrorist, look at a young Muslim male. If you’re looking for a gang shooter, look for a young black guy. If you’re looking for a child molester or a mass shooter, look for a white guy. That’s just common sense.”  So it makes sense that they'd be soft on someone who acts just like the candidate they support.

From being evicted for dubious reasons, to pressure for monthly leases, to slumlords threatening tenants to keep quiet regarding broken appliances and mold.  It's a circus.  Finding a place is just as bad if not worse.  Many nationalities will only rent to their own people, some demand certain diets only be allowed with their appliances, numerous illegal rentals, and others discriminate based on sex.  The system is completely out of whack and it's the renters who lose.  If Toronto keeps up such stupidity I wouldn't be surprised if there was a generational exodus from Canada's largest city.  Perhaps educated and skilled individuals should start looking at emigrating to other countries where they are appreciated.

There is no evidence we know of that Trump people colluded in this way but this is still under investigation. There is sufficient evidence on the Russian hacking and fake news and social media sites that our intelligence officers have concluded that it happened. Trump and his people are being investigated, so he should not fire the investigator-- this is why people recuse themselves (Sessions recusal is an example).

Coaches and players spend hours watching film and looking for cracks where 1/10th of a second makes the difference. Ever since I was a little kid the game always comes down to who blocks and tackles the best. Who can cause turnovers. Who can keep away from stupid penalties and mistakes. It's really pretty basic. Only the strong survive, not only physically but mentally.  I think coaches need to back off and let the players play. Let the QB call the majority of plays. Let the defensive linebackers call the formations. Let the coaches run players in and out keeping them fresh. Once you can establish field position, then open things up and strike when odds are in your favor. Teams need more discipline including the coaches. That's why the Patriots are favored.Denver can beat these guys if they play together and keep focus. This team isn't used to having butts kicked.

Everybody is on to you on this one, Western woods.  You pay for your public sector pension by returning some of your excessive income which is only made possible by the NET TAXPAYERS in the market sector but you pay much less into and get much more out of your pension plan than equivalent market employees.  As Detroit and some California cities have learned too late, funding the excessive retirement pensions and benefits of former public employees is the most difficult financial challenge they are facing.

UT (5) generated a margin of 385,000 """"wasted"""" votes for Bush. 8 small western states, with less than 1/3 of CA’s population, provided Bush with a bigger margin (1,283,076) than CA provided Kerry (1,235,659).  In the 4 battleground states (OH, VA, IA, and FL) that got 2/3rds (176 of 253) of the 2012 general-election campaign events, and a similar fraction of campaign expenditures, campaigns were proportional-to-population in various parts of the states.

There are other studies out there which agree that, no, she doesn't have an unfair advantage.  Another thing you should know is that trans women tend to have lower than normal T levels. Cisgender women naturally produce more testosterone than they do. Trans women's means for producing T are disabled or removed.  It's pretty telling that no one seems to care when a cisgender woman has higher than normal T level, which does occur naturally, but without any evidence of an advantage, it is assumed that a trans woman has an advantage and 3 times as much T as a cis woman. The T limit set by the IOC is actually for all women though, cis or trans. And many ciswomen are higher than average. But people would rather hate on trans women.

Thomas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit both recognized and criticized Buck v. Bell by writing """"as Justice Holmes pointed out in the only part of Buck v. Bell that remains unrepudiated, a claim of a violation of the Equal Protection Clause based upon selective enforcement 'is the usual last resort of constitutional arguments.'"""" In 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit cited Buck v. Bell to protect the constitutional rights of a woman coerced into sterilization without procedural due process. The court stated that error and abuse will result if the State does not follow the procedural requirements, established by Buck v. Bell, for performing an involuntary sterilization.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_v._Bell

While suturing a cut on the hand of a 75 year old rancher, whos' hand was caught in the gate while working cattle, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually the topic got around to Obama being elected by a mass of media led, brainless liberals to be our president.  The old rancher said, """"Well, ya know, Obama is a 'Post Turtle'"""". Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a 'post turtle' was. The old rancher said, """"When you're driving down a country road on you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a 'post turtle"""".  The old rancher saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain. """"You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, and he doesn't know what to do while he's up there, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with"""".

0,"Since 1970 US spending on K-12 education has increased 4 times more than the rate of inflation while student performance has flat-lined or declined. The poor performance is part of the Democrat war on children. The US spends more money on K-12 education than all other countries in the world, except maybe Switzerland and most of the developed countries out-perform the US on student achievement. If more money is the answer, it was a very stupid question. Instead of increasing spending on education as a knee-jerk reaction, one should ask themselves why countries that spend less get better results. One might even adopt the techniques those countries use to get the better results. Clallam’s state legislators get 90% of their campaign contributions from the I-5 corridor, where median household income is 55% higher. Are they looking out for you or their donors?

I realize that in reality it doesn't matter, and if someone has to write a check for $1,000 (or a 5% sales tax on everything they buy...) and then gets a PFD for $1,000 later it's a wash.  But the psychological effect is a whole lot different.  More important than getting the revenue is getting engagement from Alaska citizens (voters).  Until then the politicians won't change their corrupt and wasteful habits.

During the war, the Swiss banks kept funds for American and other multinational companies for goods and services rendered to the Nazis after treating with the enemy laws came into effect.

Those things are secured by an asset even if it's a depreciating one like a car.  For many people in financial  trouble, use of the credit card is the only remaining way to sustain an unaffordable lifestyle.   They've exhausted their savings. They have no assets to sell.  They can't borrow money through a conventional loan, and they can't get a line of credit.  No easy fix to this problem.  People need to be more financially literate when it comes to saving and budgeting and spending money but that doesn't  help a struggling consumer very much..  It may be for many of these people that personal bankruptcy or some sort of creditor arrangement is the only solution.

In the 41 red, blue, and purple states surveyed, overall support has been in the 67-81% range - in rural states, in small states, in Southern and border states, in big states, and in other states polled.

Under the ACA, I have a great policy that costs only $3k/year. It can't be canceled if I use it, it covers more and it's much cheaper. What's not to like?

And another important point is that it's these private companies, not Honolulu government or our residents who would be putting most, if not all the money into the project. So we won't be bearing the $3-billion more needed to finish the project.  Honolulu Rail, on the other hand, will need us to come up with  $3-billion more just to finish building it.

As to banning them, people who own fully automatic firearms legally go through extensive background checks before the sale is permitted. What more do you want?

1,"This is just one more illustration, added to numerous others this week, of how totally incompetent Donald Trump is for the office of President of the USA.  Trump has YUGE ideas backed up by absolutely zero attention to the details of implementation.  Trump authorises military action that promises to make him look like a hero and then has to apologise for the death of a soldier and wounding of others.  Trump places a ban on Muslim travel to USA and chaos and condemnation erupts around the globe and USA allies are faced with the choice between stroking Trumps ego or opposition within their own governing parties.  All of this will not end well for Donald Trump or for the USA.

But they have hitched their wagon to him  and cutting the harness at this point would merely leave them stranded. Contrary to the hopes and dreams of the left I doubt that Trump is going to do or say something so egregious that the GOP will move to impeach him.  The Post and Democrats need to start thinking in realistic terms about the future. The key to change is coming up with candidates for office who represent moderate viewpoints and are not dragging around a ton of baggage. It terrifies me that Hillary is clearly thinking of running again. Almost as bad would be Joe Biden or Liz Warren. Where are Democrats to defeat Mike Coffman and Cory Gardner?  Time to quit whining about Trump and start taking useful actions.

So far, Raitt's platform focuses on balanced budget and lower taxes but still improving health care and the innovation agenda, while preserving or advancing women's causes.  The hook in her platform is a 'taxpayer protection act' to protect Canadians from future Trudeau-like governments.  It does all sound a bit optimistic, but who wouldn't agree there is federal government waste that adds little value, which most Canadians would not even notice if it were reduced or eliminated?  I don't see anything in her platform that is not inclusive.

From all reports, Mr. Christian was a right-wing unhinged individual who killed two men (and seriously wounded another) who attempted to intercede as he accosted two young women.

It will likely also energize hard-core left-wing activists to oppose it.  These are two groups with little restraint regarding physical violence.  I think it's highly likely that """"street demonstrations"""" will get quite ugly.  That said, I am a strong advocate for First Amendment rights.. Like the ACLU and their defense of the American Nazi Party's march in Skokie, Illinois, I defend the Trump folks' right to hold an event in Portland.

0,"I don't think he ignores violent and dangerous people at all.   It's certainly something that I have to accept as a non-violent person.    But I think he rightly concludes that love and compassion are a stronger and more enduring bond of community than are hate and violence.  If you want a bar fight, the haters will win.    They can act without reservation, they can't be reasoned with.   That is not a conservative trait nor is it a liberal trait.  The urge to violence is part of our nature.  Non-violence does work, does overcome, does have power.    It is not fast, it is seldom overpowering.  While human military power is always a great asset if you believe violent conflict in inevitable, some people live their life with a continuity that looks past the fear of death.  The values of their life mean as much as the gold they have accumulated.  If you are non violent in a violent world, you must accept the possibility of a shortened time on earth.    That's a choice.

Allowing visitor lodging businesses to proliferate in residential zoning would only add more harm to an already very bad situation. Airbnb didn't care about collecting taxes.

Since FAA nor other regulators will intervene when these sometimes overpowered loud under-muffled aircraft wheel about senselessly for hours, over pristine valleys where their racket echos off the mountains for miles, one thing the prudent outdoor lover, be it hiking, hunting, nature photography, wildlife studies, & so on, can do is make note of the plane's identification and hours of operation on those days.  Instead of citing an unregulated noise factor, the prudent can record, take images, & file safety complaints. FAA will investigate those. ;)

I read quite a bit out of Australia (Catholica and Eureka Street) and at the Irish Association of Catholic Priests - because they have people who are seeking ...what?.... """"the Jesus way"""", a way to ground what it means to live a moral life and seek to explore who, what, where, how God is.  Here, I think the short comments allowed are a real problem to presenting an argument or viewpoint that can invite discussion.

0,"Moral caution is a good argument. It is persuasive, and properly so.  But  it is not conclusive.  The woman may think it is or isn't murder, and be correct, or not, and the fetus will or won't have whatever degree of consciousness of its end, but the only one who knows definitively is God.  I think that suggests the matter is best left to the woman and her conscience.  The belief that a zygote is morally indistinguishable from a delivered baby is not conclusively upheld by the argument for moral caution, or the argument from biological continuity, as long as we hold that a person is more than flesh.  It is therefore a personal belief, held by many people. Some are so swayed by the belief that they hold it as a moral certainty, not just for themselves, but for all women.  They proclaim abortion murder, and women who abort murderers,  when the principle of moral caution itself would suggest they ought to hesitate at leveling such a grievous charge, given the lack of objective certainty.

It is shameful to me that popes have required the bishops to pledge obedience to them, even when the popes have chosen to ignore the command of Jesus to protect the innocence of children. Why should we, the people of God, listen to these pompous men who never listen to us? Sadly, the leaders of my Church worship the man-made institution of the Church with all of its rules and regulations, I do not think many of them know Jesus or listen to the Holy Spirit in their lives. Our Congress is full of self-righteous Christians who want to take away any support for our most marginalized. Very sad!

The port brings in most of the state's goods, which are then trucked or taken by rail to other parts of the state, including the Kenai, Fairbanks and Mat-Su where they are bought and sold.

Women work now, have careers now, get advanced degrees now, participate in decision making, have growing influence in politics.  And yet, the Church sidelines women.  I think we have also learned a great deal more about humans, creation, evolution - and we need to deal with non-heterosexuals as equally beautiful creations of God  What I do believe is the process of change is messy and we are in the process of change.  If the church does not change it will fade into a cult like sect, not the tool of evangelization that is their charge from God Himself.

After the Morgentaler saga had finally made the SCC realise in 1988 that banning choice contravened the CCRF, the federal government tried to re-criminalise it in 1989 - defeated in the Senate.  Various provinces then tried obstructionist tactics, such as refusing payment for abortions, led by Bill Vander Zalm in BC. There are still provinces where women are unable to have abortions or must have them in a hospital.  Making MAID economically unviable for doctors is just a backdoor attempt to thwart the will of the public, as with abortions, and the ruling of the SCC.

That's called a dog whistle, and his dogs heard it loud and clear as they tore down grave markers at Jewish cemeteries all over the country. His dogs continue to heed his call.

From a statist point of view he is absolutely correct in his analysis of the oil and gas industry. I believe that he and others are correct that in the short-run, the state can garner more revenue from this industry.  That the Alaskan people are just now beginning to feel exposed (the dead of winter is a damn good time to start thinking in these terms) proves the point that what happened during our oil period was a mistaken strategy on the part of our people: The Democrats in power at the inception of this period of our history are a big part of the blame.  Many believe the new house coalition will bring relief and fairness: I think not as these are the same ilk as the rascals who set this mess up in the first place; they believe in big government which the numbers say we can't support.

This article seems almost desperate to paper over vanishing knowledge and failing prophesy by advocating a retrograde post-truth denominationalism for Seventh-day Adventists.  There is “a more excellent way,” compared with vanishing knowledge, failing prophesy, and tongues gone silent (1 Cor 13).  In the end as well as the beginning there is faith, hope and love.

"
0,"Absolutely true - we should be moving to pro-slow immigration and recognizing like an intelligent society that a vast labour oversupply is far more damaging than labour scarcity (because of the social benefits uptake and the drag on the economy). Business wants the labour oversupply as it suppresses wages and social benefits ensure that each new body is still a consumer - it is a massive corporate welfare scheme nowhere more visible than refugees taking in thousands of dollars a month. If the social benefits were not available, people would stop coming here en masse.  But the politicians only have ears for business, not the cries of their citizens who are footing the bill, so expect prices to go up another million like happened in Vancouver and the tax base to be further hollowed out.  The hundreds of thousands of foreign students being recruited to proxy buy housing (displacing domestic applicants and taking youth jobs) are part of the problem as well.

It is the Jewish land, and the Jews did not need the Europeans to give it to them. A few weeks ago UN's Unesco made it clear that they did not recognize Jewish rights to the Temple area, only Muslim rights. As Netanyahu always points out, this non-recognition of the Jewish connection to the land is the source of the IsraelPalestinian conflict.

0,"""""... the Affordable Care Act, which has played no small role in the reduction in the abortion rate to its lowest level in more than forty years.""""  And why is that?  In large part because the Affordable Care Act made sure forms of effective contraceptives were made widely available and affordable.  Are you ready to admit that now?  More, are you ready to admit that even Catholic universities, hospitals and other Catholic affiliated organizations that hire people for their job skills and not for their religious observance, should be required to cover contraceptives in health insurance?  The Little Sisters of the Poor should not be able to make up the minds of their employees regarding contraceptives but let the employees make up their own minds.  Making abortion illegal without making effective contraceptives available is just going to drive abortions into back alleys, where it was thriving prior to making abortions legal.  It is going to kill women.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Israel can utterly dictate US foreign policy but that's all fine and dandy because it wasn't a direct, quid pro quo cash payment.  Instead, some vague and circumstantial business deal that can in some way be remotely tied to Trump is taken as evidence of corruption, even though nobody can demonstrate how this has affected his position or policy in any measurable way, or that it's even a bad policy in the first place (peace with Russia).

0,"While in her own mind Denise Dresser can equate legitimate refugee status to that of economic migrant status, others do not see it that way. Those legitimate refugee's which Canada does accept, come from area's of the world which are devastated by war, persecutions and uncontrolled violence. Economic and social migrants on the other hand, are accepted upon certain conditions of education and wealth creation. These conditions are related to Canada's own economic and social needs. In this sense, a refugee has a need to be here, while an economic migrant does have other viable options. If Ms. Dresser is so outraged at the US sanctions, perhaps she should return her degree to Princeton. After all at her age it is her peer group which has set those conditions of NAFTA. I don't think anyone has the right to have it both ways, so to speak. Either Mexico is a sovereign nation and trading partner or, it is a country of such concern that it's citizens may be deemed to be refugee's elsewhere.

They included 570 black bears, 322 gray wolves, 61,702 coyotes, 2,930 foxes, and 305 mountain lions. In 2015 they killed 3.2 million animals, including 68,905 coyotes, 731 bobcats, 480 bears, 385 wolves, and 284 mountain lions.  Methods include but are not limited to traps, snares, poisons, gas, and aerial gunning (both from planes and helicopters).  Hate to tell you this Mike, but you don't know what you are talking about.  The Feds do use federal tax dollars for predator control.

0,"The environmental problems have been known for decades along with solutions.  While new data refines estimates the projections are no longer the question.  The question is now how do we change outcomes which must involve the whole world to be effective. Many countries do not have the capital for the initial changes so finding financial means is the new problem.  Economic projections are not as well developed as traditional science so there is controversy about the best way to proceed but not about the need for change. Take Puerto Rico as an example of GDP capital drain of fossil fuels. About 8.6% of GDP goes for fuel imports most of which is diesel for power generation which is inefficient and expensive. The problem is the initial capital to move toward a renewable zero fuel cost economy.  They may be helped by high tech companies, not so much because they are nice guys but because they are developing a future customer base.

However, by keeping weed illegal and overpriced, a user will elect to smoke it since that is the cheapest way to get high.  If the gov't is concerned about the health effects, then allowing users to leaglly grow their own would be a better option. If we were able to grow our own, we could harvest enough to experiment with edible and alcohol infused options that would greatly reduce health effects.

As taxpayers, you will lose the ability to offset your expenses via itemized deductions.  Talk to your tax consultants about the proposed changes and how they could seriously impact your retirement years. The horizon for all of us is less medical insurance coverage, higher medical expenses, rising property taxes that we cannot deduct because housing market is going through the roof.

I found it totally distasteful , demeaning to women and many other segments of our society. Donald Trump was a frequent visitor on the show. Him and Stern yucked it up, describing their many conquests of women. Eventually, I became the manager in charge and started to receive complaints from the few women who arrived early in the morning. Eventually after talking to upper management, we were able to shut down the Stern show at the store. It truly amazed me that after the Access Hollywood tapes were released and many women came forward to talk about Trump and his sexual assaults, he still got elected president. Many of the women coming forward now were silent at the time. The women who came forward were threatened by Trump with lawsuits, which never came about. This has been going on too long.

Socialism always requires force (violence) to gain compliance.  As socialist systems (all) fail to produce at levels desired by the users, the system must ration its output.  Rationing can be done by price or availability.  The US has used price (huge profits for doctors etc), while countries like Canada and Europe have used availability (wait in line).  I don't support either system.  I would support a free market system; free of detailed government oversight from top to bottom.  The original comment was about the idea that people """"deserve"""" healthcare, and since care has costs, the cost must be born by either the user or another.

0,"I wrote on this on Sunday on my blog and will reprint in the comments.  Leviticus was not so much revelation as natural law reasoning with authority attributed to revelation, although the quoted passages do capture the why of morality.  So does the saying of Jesus that he is gentle and humble of heart, his yoke is easy and his burden light.  This demands a humanistic morality, one that does not try to make us angels but more fully human - including in the economic realm.  If we remember we are brothers, we will not make each other slaves as the capitalist does.  Nor will we persecute our brothers and sisters for expressing the sexuality they were born with.  Indeed, we will celebrate it in a Church wedding.  Instead of condemning either doctors or mothers to the criminal justice system for abortion, we will make it economically possible to not only continue the pregnancy, but see the child through to college.  The Dogma of Mercy must define what is sin as well as forgiveness.

0,"There is a natural inclination to think that way - but the science doesn't support it. Numerous studies, including a Canadian study of breast cancer over a quarter century, show little if any benefit from early diagnosis. And that doesn't factor in the impact of what is an alarming rate of false positives.  The 30 percent figure, I suspect, is extremely conservative. We all know people who, though seemingly healthy, spend an inordinate amount of time in the health care system. I think it's partly because it's free and partly because our culture is more preoccupied with disease than health. Women seem especially inclined to engage the medical profession for themselves and their children when the circumstances don't really warrant it.  I warn them - not completely in jest - that if they keep looking for something wrong, the medical establishment will eventually oblige them.

0,"Well said. 1) Beyak was never muzzled. She made her comments in the Senate and to various media outlets from coast to coast. No one refused to broadcast or print her statements. People simply objected to her odious attempt to rewrite history. That is OUR right. 2) Now, just as reprehensible, is her attempt to cast herself as a victim.  And, of course, by invoking the """"silent majority"""" (as if such an animal is even possible in the internet age) she aligns herself with another sleazeball in history -- Richard Nixon. When the whole country was going up in flames protesting against the barbarities and death toll inflicted by U.S. troops in Vietnam, President Nixon went on air in 1969 and claimed a """"silent majority"""" was actually in favour of the war. It was only the media and a vocal minority causing the uproar, according to Nixon. Tricky Dicky and his devious ways were eventually booted to the political curb. The same thing should happen to Bayek.

0,"No, I don't expect a personal call back from my senator. I do expect his staff to call me back when I ask a question on voicemail. They are no doubt swamped. So many people with questions... Probably something that a few carefully planned public forums could help with.  Oh and by the way, Indivisible groups from January onward have privately attempted to meet Gardner and other GOP reps on their own grounds. Ie, tell us how you WOULD want to meet and we will be there, agree to terms, etc.  Nothing from Gardner. He is not interested. And yes, we are still his constituents even if we definitely aren't his voting base. We still deserve to be served, listened to, and represented.

No one deserves to die, if it's true the victim punched the old man while seaed in the car, he may have picked on the wrong old guy. Not saying the old guy had the right to shoot  but the victim kind of played the odds with his life.  on another topix, I understand and live with the going to and fro from work type of driving habits. But during regular work hours I do get upset with punk drivers who pull in front of me sqeeezing in between the front car and me. It pisses me off and give em the finger. One of these days I'll do it to the wrong person and I may pay with my life but I stand up for what I believe the driver(s) shouldn't have done and let them know it.

We do not want too proceed with expensive and divisive recall elections each time we disagree.  We hope to proceed by listening to those we elected, not some anonymous post made on a social media site.

We aren't talking about foreign insurgencies and enemies that are indistinguishable from civilians - the US has no equal when it comes to the conventional power - especially in the air and in the seas, where it counts if all hell breaks loose. The F-22 Raptor is unparalleled, not to mention the bomber groups. It's not a secret, the US doesn't hide their capabilities, the North Koreans can hear the sonic booms of fighters on the border and they can see the naval battle groups operate seamlessly with each other and with their allies (specifically Japan and South Korea). Kim Jong Un is using the same playbook as his father in terms of trying to get concessions under the threat of military confrontation.

0,"So what was the regular growth rate in the world prior to the industrial revolution?  My recollection of Europe was that growth barely matched population growth, which was constrained by food production - a very Malthusian situation.  You couldn't grow richer, so yes you """"stole richer"""" - wars and looting.   England took advantage of those technologies that made it possible for growth rates faster than population growth.  Should England have exported those technologies to India?  Maybe.  Would anything have changed in India if England never came by?  Maybe if India discovered those same technologies and employed them he same way.  India was richer than England at the time so why didn't Indians discover them first?  Would India have shared those technologies with England if they had?  It is all very contingent on historical events.    As for 1943, there was this thing called WW2 going on at the time and the British were losing - perhaps tht distracted them?

0,"I agree with much of your post except the part about not allowing younger siblings to enroll.  As a practical matter, having all one's children in the school your family has chosen is important.  I have had my kids in a charter school although for various reasons including age difference, both went through the lottery.  Observing that school's enrollment over the years, the admission of siblings did not significantly reduce the spots available for the lottery. Some siblings were placed in public or private because the school wasn't a good fit for that particular child.  But it was the parent's choice.  I do agree that schools should not be able to charge increased tuition because there are vouchers.  That's part of what has caused obscene inflation in higher education once the government started paying for it. As far as contributing time - many private schools are successful in part because of the community aspect created by parents working on projects together.

0,"About 30 years ago I gave evidence at an inquest into the death of Lester Donaldson, a mentally-ill man who was shot by police. The jury came out with the same recommendations that have been repeated by every jury since then, yet the deaths are still happening. What we are doing is simply not working. The one common factor with all of these deaths is that the person involved has either refused treatment or has stopped medication. As any relative of a person suffering from schizophrenia can tell you, people with a serious mental illness often have no insight into their illness and do not believe that they are ill. Yet they are allowed to make medical decisions on the false assumption that they are competent. A way must be found to treat people before they become so agitated and confused that they become violent. Unfortunately our society is so hung up on individual rights above all else that the mentally-ill are allowed to destroy themselves rather than submit to treatment.

0,"For a basic income grant, the treasury has to raise tax. Obviously from the people who already have jobs - this is clear. The majority of taxpayers, both individual and corporate have very little problem with paying their fair share of tax provided that the tax collected is put to work for the common good. If the common good includes welfare payments to the unemployed that is generally seen as being fair and reasonable.  What is not fair, or reasonable, is for the money collected to be spent on bureaucrats who are paid large sums, produce nothing and leave very little for the unemployed.  South Africa is no more a capitalist society than China. Vast platoons of central and local government """"workers"""" being paid unrealistically high salaries, siphon off the taxes and rates collected from the payers and the results of their efforts are pathetic.

While we need to increase production, SB 21 subsidizes production from existing fields. That's a short term band-aid at best.

That British MP's sit silent in their seats without demanding to debate - and vote on - the most important national decision since WW2 is unbelievable.  By any standard this is a Parliament and government that has lost its legitimacy, both because of its pre-referendum position and its post-referendum about-face. Britons have a perfect right to jump off the Brexit cliff if they want to.  But this is exactly the kind of issue that requires an election in the Westminster system. As it is, the supremacy of Parliament is now shown to be just a hollow concept. If British MP's had integrity they would demand a vote to dissolve Parliament, and let the British people elect a new Parliament and government specifically on this issue - one with a clear mandate to proceed one way or another.

Those who've followed the digital v. analog recorded music debate ongoing for decades now, are familiar with a phenomenon that appears counter-intuitive: 'Loss type' digital (compressed MP3, for instance) loses nuances and background ambience, but in doing so, can reveal the wanted information in a clearer way.  Learning old tunes from a digital medium is often easier than from the original vinyl itself! What appears to be happening is a (intended or otherwise) clarity of information rendered by disregarding the superfluous information from the rendition.  The psyche must be capable of doing similar if not same. It is known to neurologists and psychoacousticians that along neural pathways, a carrier frequency is used, and so information is *somewhat* sorted and rationalised into bits, whether that be digital or not is another question, but abuse of the system will render *intelligibility* compromised by missing bits.

That does not give them the tools to help us understand the Scriptures or the over-all message of Jesus.  Most are not sufficiently trained in psychology or counseling to provide needed support to people.

If Jesus did not secure for us a way of knowing with certainty who He is and what is required of us then He is profoundly unjust as our salvation is gravely at stake because we can't be sure about what God desires from us.  If you don't then you are by definition not a Christian and you can carry on saying what you like.

0,"I dislike the idea of a Netflix tax to fund Canadian content. My concern is that it would become a slush fund for make-work projects for bad Canadian actors , directors and writers. Canada has such a long record of producing junk. True, Canada has produced a bit of good TV but few good movies. Sadly, the good is hugely underproportionate to the bad. Quebec is producing good directors. Let's learn from them.

0,"Well, yes, if it is dreck.  There seems to be some consensus in the Church that a Eucharistic Prayer be a Eucharistic Prayer, not a paean to hovering.  Theologically it has some serious flaws. For example, he alleges the Holy Spirit:  """"made us temples of your love""""  Well, if He made us """"temples of your love"""", we can pull up a chair, prop up our feet, and have a smoke. """"Temples of your love""""is the goal, not our current state.  The Holy Spirit is invoked in Eucharistic Prayers east and west for the epiclesis, the making of bread and wine into the Body and Blood, and nothing else.  In addition, we ask the Father to make us (we aren't made yet) worthy to enter heaven, and to fill us with the Holy Spirit.  And we ask this through the merit of his Son, not our own worthiness.

Get local companies involved.  Provide training and employment opportunities.  Provide tax incentives.  Have rules to live in the facilities, and if you don't follow them you have to leave Portland city limits. The city really doesn't want to get their hands dirty by actually taking care of these people.  That is why they are trying to hand the situation off to the county.  I'm sure the spreadsheet types will show how financial impossible this is, but not really taking this matter in hand and getting these people real help is going to cost this city plenty.  The schools are just sitting there waiting for the city to make big bucks off of them.  That is what the mayor and city council is really all about.

That might change if many thousands of young Canadians got after their MPs, making it clear they would like to have a chance at a home someday.  If Justin came to believe his re-election was at risk, he might do what he should do anyway: (1) limit foreign buyers via big, national purchase taxes, quantity limits, big taxes on vacancies, and enforcement of income tax laws and money-laundering rules; (2) go further in limiting domestic mortgage loan guarantees; (3) help local governments to enforce zoning rules; and (4) above all, quit letting people who come in under visitor's visas buy property, have babies and stay forever (income-tax free!).  He could allow previous foreign buyers to keep their properties, but limit the future flow, and the market would still go way down if such measures were implemented.

0,"Even leading up to 1973, abortion numbers are extremely low until 1970, the first year in which abortions surpassed 100k.  Of course, anyone who understands the history of the 1960's knows that the sexual revolution - free love and sex without consequences - ushered in a contraceptive mentality, which conservatives and religious leaders warned would, in turn, beget an abortive mentality.  That is exactly what the abortion statistics of the 1960's and '70's suggest happened. Let's be honest, the left is not concerned about children born to poor parents or to single, teen-aged mothers; they just don't want to have to control their libidos, and making abortion illegal, recognizing that human lives begin at conception, would force them to accept the responsibilities of their unbridled sex lives. Make no mistake about it, the pro-abortion mentality is the result of a culture of cheap sex.  Changing that culture is what will reduce abortions.

This would give them both a reprieve because most Venezuelans hate the US gov't more than they hate their own. Until now, whenever they would make these claims people in South America would just shake their heads in disbelief. Now POTUS just gave Maduro fuel for his fire. As someone who ran on getting us out of wars this President likes to threaten everybody with invasion.

But hundreds of thousand workers were left behind - suffering the 'boom' years with no increase in wages while paying the high housing prices that the oil industry created.

This is also at the bottom of the Spadaro article, which is part of why many people objected to it.  One theory describes a dialectical imagination and an analogical imagination. Dialectical, from dialogue, implies a belief that God has spoken and we rely on written accounts of that speech. Faith is in a set of propositions that we adhere to. The emphasis is on taking something in from another, on books and writing.  The analogical, or sacramental, imagination sees things as like, or unlike, other things.

For example, the US subsidizes its Agricultural industries big time albeit not through supply management to the extent Canada does.

An income tax would be the incentive needed to stop wasteful spending and collect from all the out-of-state employees in the oil & gas, mining, fishing and tourist industries. Someone needs to develop a sustainable strategy that is not built on the concept of infinite, non-renewable resources.

Someone here says that no firearm should have a chambered cartridge until the target is in sight.  This is false.  I have hunted large game for almost 60 years, and I have hunted safely.  When the target comes into sight, the hunter doesn't have time to chamber a cartridge, the time frame is a matter of seconds.  The rifle is carried loaded and cocked, with the safety engaged.  The hunter takes his stance, disengages the safety, takes final aim, and fires.  This should be done in three seconds, and if the hunter is competent, the first shot will result in the animal's death within another ten seconds.  After the kill, the firearm should have been unloaded.  Too bad.

Women did a much better job of making sure girls got the equal attention that they deserved in school.  Once girls had their horizon's opened through changes in schooling, they started to excel, with equal support.    For whatever reason, I think young women grew up more motivated and most boys/men still lived with the 'knowledge' that they were superior and it would stay that way.  (I did).  Maybe women, free from the role of breadwinner, but tired of their limited choices, just worked harder in school - a big bonus in an era where brains and relationship are more important in the workplace than the blue color skills men counted on.

The idea that someone could sprinkle income as dividends to their adult children to save taxes but not their children under 18 OR couldn't sprinkle income at all if their legal circumstance allowed incorporation speaks to the inherent unfairness of the existing rules.

Like the Kochs, Trump essentially wants to have the billionaire class exempted from any responsibility to maintain public services.  Obama inherited an economy that was on the verge of collapse, but I don't expect your memory goes back as far as eight years. Whatever your personal situation has been, the country recovered without undergoing a depression and perhaps helping to precipitate a worldwide crash.

0,"The media was wrong but still won't admit it. Nielsen says over 31 million watched the Inauguration in the U.S. alone. But it was also broadcast worldwide. Obama TV audience in 2009 was 40 million. But livestreaming via TV networks, Youtube, Twitter and other media also provided tens of millions of viewers -- a source that did not exist in 2009.  Indeed, CNN alone says they had over 16 million online viewers. So Spicer's statement is unassailable. He had no reason to back down and didn't. After calling him a liar for two days, the media owed him an apology. They had characterized his remarks as referring solely to those present in person. But he had clearly said “both in person and around the globe”. The media can no longer be trusted. Even after todays' press conference where he walked the media through an understanding of exactly what he said, TIME magazine has a headline that shows its despicability: """"Sean Spicer Stands By False Inauguration Claim"""". His claim was not false. TIME is.

The CDC is the governmental agency most capable of performing an unbiased study of the incidence and causes of those deaths, categories of circumstances and other data which would be very helpful in understanding firearm deaths.  The NRA controlled GOP Congress has pass legislation specifically prohibiting the CDC from engaging in such studies.

The NRA is afraid that such information might somehow support increased control of firearm sales, possession or use, so they use their considerable muscle to block such research.

0,"Another significant factor delaying discharge: the funding process for home care, assisted living, or skilled facility care. Once a patient is ready to transition (or very close), many patients need to apply for specific insurance to cover that kind of care, which is not automatic under most plans. (Just because it was considered medically necessary by a multidisciplinary team doesn't mean it was covered... but your hospital stay? That's definitely decertified now, because the team is recommending transfer to a different level of care.) The state can take 30 days to review that application once all the materials are pulled together - and it essentially -always- takes 28-30 days.  Assisted living and skilled nursing applications aren't reviewed until that funding is in place as they are in no position to hold beds indefinitely. This leads to a 2-4 week extension of hospital time on these stays, & it's not something anyone wants.

Yet, you can go to a shooting range there, which boasts literally centuries of operation without an incident, and even get a beer while you're shooting.  Ownership of firearms does not mean more violent crime. The UK, they moved to knife-problems after their gun laws came into effect. Australia saw gun crime go down, but violent crime go up.  Violent crime has actually been on a downward trend for well over a decade in the US, incidents like this are getting more and more rare on a per-capita basis. That doesn't seem to stop people like you from placing blame on the tool that was used, and not the person using it.

0,"I thought it was Carter during the fabricated fuel shortages that first went to 55,  but it doesn't matter.    Republicans used to be very pragmatic problems solvers, often grounded in private leadership roles.   (I pulled for George Romney) They weren't 'warm' enough for those who couldn't look past the problem to the solution.  I had a deep respect for those Republicans who I always viewed as more consistent in leadership skills.    I respect the empathy for others that i personally see in liberalism,, but we need a viable, fact based Republican party of problem solvers.     All seems lost at the moment, but that leaves an opening for a man or woman, to step into the gap.   I hope I recongize that person when they appear.    *I believe Pres Bush was sincere in his hopes for compasionate conservatism, but the engrained structures were tough and his hope for peacetime was taken down by the 9/11 attack and being caught up in war/security.

0,"Ibittson misses the whole point of how Putin, the FBI and fake news purveyors influenced the election and concludes Clinton's failure was her own fault.  Clinton's support went on a roller coaster ride every time a new allegation hit the media. All of these stories later proved to be false. The vote was close enough in four key states (Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida) that swing voters made a difference. Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of 2.3 million voters. Without all the fake news and interference her margin of victory would have been double that and these states would have gone to her.  Ibbitson is clearly a fawning disciple of whichever conservative is in power or about to gain power and a foe of anything liberal. He is correct that Trump will most likely prevail in the electoral college despite all the reports of dissent but that does not prove the rest of his argument.

I said that redistricting can and should be done scientifically because you asked how it should be done instead. I never said the court used it as an argument. It remains that the same science which tells us how it SHOULD be done, also told us it was done wrong now.  2) Your point is flagrantly false. There is an obvious way to do it, and there definitely IS an obviously WRONG way to do it. Anytime you have two parts of the same district which are not in any way connected to each other physically (but do share demographics) - that's obvious gerrymandering. By the way- the republicans better HOPE they lose this case. The democrats have been doing very well in state-level special elections this year.

They are spewing extremely hot materials into the seas. One must wonder if these volcanos have a significant impact on the earth's climate as they warm the waters, which in turn impact the weather, which in turn impacts the overall climate. Perhaps we are focusing on the wrong major cause of climate change by not putting the correct amount of weight on the impact of these volcanos. Just because we cannot see them does not mean they are not heavily impacting our climate. We really cannot do anything about the volcanos, but we would know not to waste money trying to mitigate some other suspected causes.

Mr Gui's false identity didn't emerge in traffic court because bribes were taken to conceal it: but the case kept being reopened so more could be demanded; and eventually he fled. With no incentive for further concealment, the court discovered he was a Tiananmnen renunciate; thereupon finding him solely responsible for the accident, and liable to penalty. As he was no longer there to imprison, it supposedly bailed him on two years' probation, from which he was then said to have absconded.  When abducted from Thailand eleven years later, he was forced to say in a tv confession video that he'd voluntarily returned to China to fulfill this sentence. And four of his colleagues were arrested, then bailed to Hong Kong; so that they'd very publicly return to probation of their own.

The government should eliminate the following non-refundable tax credits: volunteer firefighters, search and rescue volunteers, Canada employment, Public Transit, Children's Arts, Home Accessibility Expenses, Home buyers, Adoption Expenses and Pension Income.  I'm fine with family caregiver, tuition, education and textbook, medical expenses and donations and gifts also being eliminated. Then either increase the Basic Personal amount, lower the tax rates and/or bump up the taxable income brackets.  Simplify the tax system. People forget that every tax credit opens you to a new point of audit by CRA. Simplification usually leads to more compliance.

Backing out Energy then, that would leave us with a $30bln deficit with the US in all others markets.  Seems like they either want to try to squeeze blood out of a stone, which is insulting, or more likely have decided to use this to distract the public from the $347bln deficit problem they have with China for which they aren't taking any action.

0,"A single-payer system would build on Obamacare's successes. It would create a federal healthcare infrastructure that every citizen pays into and is covered by, which would allow the government to negotiate the prices of medications and medical services, thereby bringing the overall cost of healthcare down while providing coverage for everyone. Insuring the entire population lowers the costs too – with everyone paying into the system, people who need a lot of care aren’t burdened with higher premiums and healthier people have coverage when they need it. Every other industrialized nation has single-payer healthcare and pays between one and two thirds what we do for it while covering everyone. Obamacare improved our medical system, but the only way to truly fix it is to take one last step and make healthcare universal. And if nothing else, from a moral standpoint, should whether you live or die really be determined by the benefits your job gives you or how much money you have in the bank?

This suggests the often tendency of some motorists to focus on their own goals at the expense of the larger benefit. I roughly categorize motorists between two extremes: On one side: Those who honestly believe they know what is best for our roads. They see poor design and think that even though they have no technical training, they know more than planners and engineers. This is part of a larger view that government cannot match their own personal expertise. Their personal experience is expert experience and their advice """"common sense"""". Systems hold them back. At the opposite extreme are those who trust experts even over their own perception. While others see this as weakness, they understand they are part of a group, and as such must follow group rules even if personal experience is contrary. The system enables more to achieve even if they lose sometimes.

People under $200k maybe, but in the $200-500k level, the new standard deduction wipes out some of the tax subsidized interest.  By my calculations, at $400k mortgage/$80k household income they lose about $250/month compared to either renting or owning outright. This part is important - if you are in this range, you need to sell your house eventually to someone.  If that someone is a renter (likely) they LOSE that by buying your house.  landlord income up, home ownership down, labor mobility up

The word itself conjures up images of sneaky social workers kidnapping children from otherwise happy lives.  But why?  Were 1960s social workers all sadistic, racist psychopaths?  Seems unlikely.  Were the kids moved because there was demand from white people to adopt first nations kids that the government wanted to meet?  Were the social workers trying to better the lives of the kids from a socio-economic/education perspective without giving due regard to breaking up families.  Or were the kids in real danger due to neglect, violence, or substance abuse in the home?  Recall what this settlement is for.  It relates to Brown v.

Catholic Relief Services and Catholic Mid-East cannot do everything.  I don’t read CNA, including the link.

As of Nov. 2015, just over 1800 Syrian refugees had been resettled in the U.S., & Germany 38000 & Canada 36000 since 2013. Of the Syrian refugees admitted to the U.S., half are children and only 2% are single men of combat age. This year the Obama administration wants to increase refugees to 10000. For a sense of proportion, there are 4.3 million U.N. registered Syrian refugees.  Some politicians/pundits claim Obama wants to bring in 250,000 Syrian refugees. That number has no basis in fact. 85000 is the TOTAL number of REFUGEES from ALL parts of the world the U.S. will bring in this year, NOT THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN REFUGEES.  Refusing refugees from a religion comprising 1.5 billion is shear madness & also Un-American & plays into the hand of ISIS hate. Congrats on your ISIS enabling!

0,"As part of tax reform the U.S. should adopt territorial/residential taxation for individuals.  The U.S. is the only industrialized nation that taxes the residents of other nations. All other OECD nations tax based on residency only.  U.S. tax and compliance laws apply Kafkaesque double taxation with the U.S. tax code assuming all U.S. persons are tax residents of the U.S. (even the ~9 million who live & are taxed overseas), with extra penalties restrictions and disincentives for money, accounts, pensions, and investments in countries other than the U.S., even if you live permanently overseas and your accounts are local to you.  Once resident overseas one does not receive U.S. government services provided to U.S. residents such as roads, unemployment. food stamps, etc. So there are no services in exchange for the double taxation or U.S. protection of local property or individual rights.  In an increasingly global and mobile world the U.S. should not punish U.S. persons living overseas.

There were over 200 plants used in the western hemisphere for women's health, birth control, and population control. They were deeply spiritual and honest. They were a race of mystics and vision seekers, and they built their ideology around the character development of the individual human being. They weren't trying to make the world """"better.""""

Most Alaskans have agreed that it is nice to have oil & gas workers like Blue Crest and others who keep drilling for oil! Thanks to them, most have agreed it is nice to have $60 billion dollar Permanent fund that gives all Alaska's free oil money every year without any state income tax.

They believed that the union was a voluntary joining of states.  To call them traitors for deciding to withdraw from the union is rewriting history.  You either believe in self-determination and freedom or you don't.  You can't have it both ways.  The North did enslave the south.  The south did not want a war, they wanted freedom.  As I have aged, I have realized that Lincoln conducted a war of aggression against the South and for the life of me, I cannot find any moral justification for what he did.  The slaves would have been freed after not too many years even if Lincoln had not invaded the South as the economy evolved and as the moral perceptions of southerners matured.

Furthermore, Mr. Khadr's appeals to the Canadian government for help in being released from the said USA prison (where prisoners are routinely tortured) were ignored. So, the Canadian government had full knowledge that one of its citizens was being tortured by a foreign government and also participated in interrogating (probably with the use of torture and a complete lack of due process ) them on foreign soil. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms prescribes that the Canadian government cannot do this. The government is breaking the law if it tramples on a person's rights and freedoms, which includes the right to due process and not to be tortured under any circumstances. Even if Mr Khadr was guilty of enormous crimes, the Canadian government had a responsibility to respect Mr Khadr's rights and freedoms. So, the apology and the compensation are the right thing to do.

The Glenbow Museum in Calgary has an online map that shows the location of the whiskey trading posts in southern Alberta. The number is quite shocking.  As the buffalo disappeared from Alberta, the First Nations quite naturally turned to Alberta  beef to prevent starvation. Many herds where moved to Montana as Montana did not have these problems.  Sitting Bull left his refuge in southern Sask & returned to the US to avoid starvation. The reason why the buffalo were exterminated in Sask & Alberta is too politically incorrect to mention.

In effect, Americans can buy the product, but they can't make it.  They can borrow using the financial system (*cough* 2008 *cough*) in the United States and when the banks screw up they get bailed out with taxpayer money to buy these products, but they can't actually make the products.  They can take advantage of the US educational system and hire great engineers and thinking minds (*cough* Apple *cough) yet make practically none of their products in the United States.

Ordering an evacuation can be """"damn if you do"""" and """"damn if you don't,"""" which can't be determined until after the fact.  Back in the 1980s, an earthquake off the coast of Alaska caused a tsunami that was expected to hit Hawaii.  I was working in Waikiki at the time.  Hotel guests were ordered to evacuate above the second floors and Hawaii Civil Defense recommended that non-essential employees be sent home, and they all started for home at about the same time.  The roadways became instantly clogged with thousands of people stuck in cars and buses in tsunami inundation areas.  Fortunately, the tsunami was almost unmeasurable when it reached Hawaii and everyone survived, but it would have been disastrous if the tsunami was much stronger.   In retrospect, it would have been better if Civil Defense had ordered or recommended moving to high floors or high ground instead of sending employees home.

A “gathering right” to berries based on pre-contact times would not, for example, “evolve” into a right to “gather” natural gas within the traditional territory.  The surface gathering of copper from the Coppermine River in the Northwest Territories in pre-contact times would not, I think, support an “Aboriginal right” to exploit deep shaft diamond mining in the same territory.

Gun lovers spend much time in their basements lovingly stroking their guns in wide-eyed adoration.  Guns, to them,, aren't just tools - - guns are objects of love and affection.  The NRA, the major enabler of gun-love, certainly decries the mass murder but celebrates the mass murderers' easy, unrestricted access to weapons of death.  Sadly, folks like Walleye can celebrate their gun-love joyfully  because it is far too late to do anything about it, anyway.  With nearly 400million weapons of death extant in the USA today and politicians who don't care we can be assured that mass death is now a regular and normal part of American life.  We just have to get used to it.

One might see Raleigh Carolina as a potential here  but they are only half a million. There was talk of somewhere in Canada and at first I could not understand this but if US immigration  is going to be a major hurdle to attracting top foreign workers then it starts to make sense. But then Amazon would be stuck in a high taxed socialist environment with militant labor unions. So I do not see that happening.

"
0,"Maybe.  And if that happens, she likely won't go quietly.  She'll rant and rave--because it's fashionable to do so--about the inequities of it all, the absolute prejudice inflicted upon her either through her gender, ethnic background, religion, dress, and, as she matures, her age. And she'll likely have lots of cameras and microphones thrust in her face as she does so.  Because it's the 21st century.  Your grandmother would be gobsmacked.

0,"Alaskans For Sustainable Budgets  FaceBook Group  June 8 KTUU story - Alaska's Economy Suffers As Oil Companies Scale Back """"Yup, now layer on top of that the effect of cutting the PFD, which using ISER's numbers will take another $1.40 out of the economy for each $1 of reduced PFD distributions. Even after accounting for the smaller offset of respending that $1 through the government economy, cutting the PFD still represents ANOTHER $500 million or so loss to the OVERALL Alaska economy. Yes, it benefits some in the government economy -- which now include the recipients of ‪#‎AKOilCredits‬ (SMH) -- but using ISER's numbers it is clear that PFD cuts will come at the expense of the OVERALL Alaska economy, making what already is a challenged economic situation even worse. And the worst part? If the ‪#‎AKLeg‬ votes to cut the PFD, the additional harm will be self-inflicted -- something we as Alaskans will be doing to ourselves that will make our economy worse off.""""

0,"In addition, you should check out the Harvard survey done in the US where they found that in households that saw domestic violence, a slight majority saw reciprocal violence, where both parties were hitting each other, and in those households, women were the initiators of the violence slightly over half the time. In the other half of the houses, where the violence was nonreciprocal and only one family member was doing it, over 70% of the time the woman was the culprit.  Whitaker DJ, et al. """"Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury between Relationships with Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence,"""" American Journal of Public Health (May 2007): Vol. 97, No. 5, pp. 941–47.  You cite police stats, but even in Canada, 7 of 8 people affected by DV simply don't go to the cops. Using police stats about a small minority who report to bolster feminist dogma about DV as a whole doesn't do you any justice.

0,"GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE PRIMER By Charles S. Opalek, PE  Global Warming is Dead  The argument about global warming has morphed into climate change.  This subtle shift was necessary because the warming as evidenced by satellite measurements has stopped since 1998, even while CO2 concentrations have continued to increase.  It has become increasingly obvious CO2 is not driving the warming, the climate, or anything else.  For the last 600,000,000 years temperatures have hovered around 12C about 14% of the time, around 22C about 50% of the time, and somewhere in between 36% of the time.  Right now we are at 14.5C, about 25% above the bottom of the historical range.  (Ref: Dr. Christopher R. Scotese‘s PALEOMAP Project at http://www.scotese.com/climate.htm).  We are no where near any temperature tipping point.  Get the facts at www.aconvenientfabrication.com www.windpowerfraud.com

0,"Chrizmart, I don't know how aware you are of the situation in Northern Ireland. I have never in my life experienced such overt homophobia. It was truly vicious. There was a Thursday night talk show televised each week from Belfast. The subject matter was often political and the panellists would be either unionist or nationalist politicians.  I saw the programme twice when it concerned matters surrounding homosexuality. I was utterly astonished! Unionist members of the audience at times were feral. The hatred of gay people was scary.  It was a collection of Protestant fundamentalists, a macho vulgar culture, and plain knuckledraggers. 15000 is nothing in terms of the US, but it is serious, concentrated hatred in a small part of the world.  As an aside, there is a historical relationship between N. Ireland and early white settlers in the Appalachian mountains.  Thankfully Ireland voted for gay rights at the recent referendum. I hope the North improves.

Does anyone remember going to a concert and seeing women trowing their panties or bras on the stage? Funny how prudish we can be depending on the convenience I suppose. This election season has been entertaining and very revealing.

0,"The only relevance of 'intent' in a non-intent crime is possible mitigation after conviction.  It is not relevant to prove or disprove the crime.  """"Title 18 of the United States Code does not have a culpability scheme but relies on more traditional definitions of crimes taken from common law.""""  These crimes are what are known a """"strict liability crimes""""  although they can also be proven by """"knowingly or willfully' levels of mens rea.  Other 'strict liability' cases are like Oregon's statutory rape cases.  An adult does not have to 'know' that the rape victim was under a particular age; and can't even rely on a victim who lies about her age.  """"Mistake of Age"""" is not a defense.  Thus 'strict liability.

0,"You won't be able to determine what comes after the defeat of Islamic State by ignoring why it gained so much territory in such a short time. In Iraq, IS grew quickly because it had genuine support within the population of north-east Iraq. In Syria, IS made great territorial gains because the Syrian government was locked in conflict with rebel and terrorist groups in the west of the country. IS in both areas further benefited from the support of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, with the USA's tacit approval.  The USA allowed Islamic State to arise in Iraq because it pleased their Gulf allies, and because defeating it would mean fighting Iraqis on their home turf. The USA allowed IS to take over huge portions of Syria because that furthered the goal of destroying the Syrian government. This again pleased their Gulf allies, and Israel as well.  Islamic State has been an extremely useful tool for the US, and in one form or another will continue to be so.

0,"I grew up in Michigan.  We could not swim in rivers or lakes due to industrial pollution (which since has been ended and one CAN swim today).  We passed a simple law which helped a great deal.  Industry must put put water in upstream of where they take it out.  The water must be more pure than when they took it. And NO storage of toxic material is permitted in any place where it could be leached by groundwater, because ground water eventually ends up in the Great Lakes (which are thought to be the largest freshwater reserve in the world).  My problem with these new Alaska mine projects is that they do not actually plan to deal with toxins properly (no doubt due to cost).  It is only worth mining IF you can afford to secure or clean up the mess as part of the deal, IMHO.  I favor development, if but only if you include full cleanup in the plan.

The real progress was JPII putting up a simplistic and easily-overturned argument against women priests, """"the 12 apostles were male,"""" and dropping the argument that only males could image Jesus, a male. Women are members of the Christ and can image it. Now it is up to Francis to sweep away all the remaining 'in persona Christi Capitis' clericalism, which holds that priests are like Jesus the High Priest, and act in his """"person,"""" based on a sentence in Aquinas and the Vulgate's translation of 2 Co 2:10, a translation now restored in the NAB/NABRE Bible on the Vatican and US Bishops' websites to read """"in the presence of Christ,"""" not """"in the person of."""" Yes, priests have authority, but they are not Jesus-representatives. There is only one High Priest and he is Jesus. Your pastor is not Jesus or even a stand-in for Jesus. Clericalism idolizes priests and maleness.
