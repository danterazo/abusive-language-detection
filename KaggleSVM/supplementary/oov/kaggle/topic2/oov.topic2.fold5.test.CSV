"
0,"Remember that Jeff Sessions, for all his strengths, is still a D.C. team player. Trump is not; he is playing for America's team. Though I disagree with his attempt to give a multi-trillion-dollar windfall to the insurance industry, almost everything else he does is what the American people in 'flyover country' who put him in the White House, want him to do. The fact that D.C. denizens hyperventilate over a tiny faction's bizarre perversion illustrates that they cannot even *imagine* common decency and sense. Sessions can get on America's team, or keep playing for the D.C. team as he has for decades. His choice.

0,"Let's add climate change and Trump is being investigated, as reported in the Times to your list.

0,"Drumpf's approval numbers plumb new depths as his base starts to abandon him.  Only 33% of Americans now approve of his job performance.  And most telling, more white Americans without a college degree now disapprove of his performance than approve, 50% to 43%.  76% agree he is not level-headed versus 26% who think he is.  Voter opinions of most other Trump qualities drop to new lows:  62 - 34 percent that he is not honest;  63 - 34 percent that he does not have good leadership skills;  59 - 39 percent that he does not care about average Americans;  63 - 34 percent that he does not share their values.  54 - 26 percent that they are embarrassed rather than proud to have Trump as president  57 - 40 percent he is abusing the powers of his office  60 - 36 percent that he believes he is above the law.  https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2476  And he's just getting started!  .
"
0,"and unconstitutional, but forcing them to pay a tax is not, which is how the mandates are enforced, or were before Trump issued his order to stop them from enforcing the tax penalty.  When people realize there is no fee, expect policies to be dropped, insurance companies to go belly up and single payer to result, funded by some kind of consumption or payroll tax.

1,"Actually there are many results, but not enough so far to keep warming under 2 degrees. But otherwise, many countries and some American states, despite Trump and his deliberately ignorant followers, are doing a lot. Green energy use has grown exponentially in the past few years. Let's just hope it's enough and not too late.
"
0,"Uh huh. Sure because the timing of the message had nothing at all to do with what Trump did. Nothing at all. Do you really expect people to believe that? Or do you just not care and a facile excuse is as good as the truth in your book?

"
0,"I see the Moscow based Trump post truthers have been hired by the Fascist PAB to post during the election.  Here's a quote from an April 11, 2016 article by Justine Hunter in the G&M:  """"Mr. Horgan told reporters on Monday that the so-called Leap Manifesto, which also calls for an end to all new infrastructure projects aimed at increasing extraction of non-renewable resources, does not reflect the values of British Columbians.  “It’s a document that I don’t embrace personally. There are elements in the document that make sense and there are elements that make no sense for British Columbia. So we won’t proceed under any kind of manifesto in the next 12 months under my leadership.”  Note that the Leap Manifesto also embraces motherhood, something we  know the Fascist Trump poster hates with a passion.

0,"rent-a-crowd does not mean literally rented  perhaps they are on welfare living in parents' basements with nothing better to do  all the protesting in the world is not going to change the Trump Tower to the Trudeau Tower the futility of this protest
"
1,"One thing that Trump does is keep his name in the media and memory with the least amount of effort which is pretty smart. People are so dumb anymore that come voting time they will just remember the name when they go to the polls and forget all else. Hillary needs to change her name to something people can remember as it's all a bunch of garbage what they say they will/can do and promises are forgotten. I do think that once the women get in the polling box that who they promised their husbands they will vote for will be forgotten too and that will turn the trick for Billary.

"
0,"Another gross lie by Trump in response to the fact that more than a week has passed since the death of 4 soldiers in Niger and he has not made any comment, although he had time to tweet about NFL players, his disdain for the First Amendment, and a lot of other nonsense.  “The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents ― most of them didn’t make calls. A lot of them didn’t make calls. I like to call when it’s appropriate, when I think I’m able to do it.""""   It's hard to find time to make calls to the families of Americans who have given their lives when you spend one out of every four days of your Presidency at one of your golf clubs (where he golfed 5 times in the last 9 days).
"
0,"Wow!  """"vulgarity and hate?"""" Talk about """"alternate facts.""""  There was not one report of any violence in these massive peaceful marches. (3 million worldwide). The number of participants - both good men and women who care about equality and justice- surpassed all expectations by a wide margins. I was proud to march in a sister march and I have never felt such positive solidarity. It was truly healing after the nasty rhetoric of this  election. FYI many signs spoke of unity, love, love trumping hate, and love conquering evil.  It was powerful.
"
0,"Wente writes: “Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet ministers are fundamentally opposed to nearly everything that Trumpism stands for.” This is patently false. Actually, Trudeau’s fiscal policies have strong similarities to Trump’s. They both have pledged expensive infrastructure programs to stimulate higher growth and are willing to run big fiscal deficits and run up the federal debt to do so. A big difference is that while Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary promised three to four percent growth every year that Trump was in office, Trudeau during the election campaign promised only a higher growth rate than the PBO had forecast for the next four fiscal years, i.e. better than 2.4% growth on average. So far, from October 2015 to November 2016, the actual growth rate has been pathetically short even of this more modest goal, just above 1.5% per annum.

"
0,"Mike Flynn's phone conversations put him in a much different category than a dinner photo op.  So different he lied to the Vice President and allowed Pence to make a fool of himself on National TV.  You can ignore all this if you choose, but it doesn't help your credibility in defending Trump.

0,"Wow Globe. Perusing your home page I noticed the word Trump in no less than 19 headlines. Fodder for the news grill.
"
1,"Probably not, just like you won't see Bill in church either. You liberals are so hypocritical, because you talk crap about Trump, but don't see the hypocrisy in backing Hillary. She stayed with a known pervert. He's always cheated on her and got impeached, but not convicted, because he was taking advantage of a girl twice his age! Trump is not a racist because he wants to build a wall to keep our country out of even more debt, Hillary is a liar and should of been indicted from her many lies, but you wanted her to lead this country! Ha ha thank God you idiots didn't win! Hillary committed so many crimes, but because Trump was a perceived racist then you liberals hit the fan. Go put your head back in the sand!

"
0,"Things will be bad, but unlike the 90s the other places to move so aren't so attractive.  The US has Trump whereas if they had Clinton or an establishment Republican it might be more attractive.  Alberta and Ontario had governments on the political right during the 90s, today they have left wing ones like BC will and are in a deeper mess.  Only Saskatchewan and Manitoba have centre-right governments and both being landlocked and small populations will mean less moving to them.  Now yes if Brown wins in Ontario and Kenney in Alberta you could see this change, but people don't change on the whim of a change in government, they change after a government has been in for a while and its policies have had an impact meaning it will more be if the NDP gets a second term this might happen.

0,"When you deal in oil-corrupted politics you can`t trumpet """"integrity"""" along with the word politician in the same sentence.  These are the people`s representatives,..not Conoco`s and Exxon`s... but much of the time that is not the perception. Integrity went bye-bye with the """"citizen`s united"""" decision handed down by the black-robed Supremes.  We should have listened to Eisenhower`s words a bit more closely. The General who beat Hitler`s Germany, through the largest amphibious assault the world will probably ever see again, who later led our country in mostly peace for two terms as our President, does not speak these words lightly that were not whipped up by speechwriter.

1,"Trump said this about illegal immigrants. / “This country used to mean something, all other races knew there place. Now the Mexicans are 11 Million strong and that’s why the ‘Real Americans’ are out of work. Once I become president of U.S, Mexicans will be sent back to Mexico, where they belong!” / Bottom line Trump lied.  He's been president for more than a month and you say """"not Mass Deportation"""".  Why not? / """"""""When Mexico sends it people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."""" / Fake promises are worse than fake news.
"
0,"An incumbent who runs second in the primary usually loses the run-off. The incumbent has run three times state wide and been elected twice. McConnell and Rove spent millions trashing Mo Brooks. The incumbent had Trump's endorsement, Trump's robocall and the Trump's PAC doing voter turnout. Mo Brooks has never run state wide and is not well known south of Cullman.  He still managed to get about 20% of the vote, in spite of all the negative ads Rove and McConnell paid for with lobbyist money. Roy Moore has a strong base of support. They will come to the polls to vote in the run off. Most of his voters are Trump supporters. Luther is a weak candidate. This author is clueless and delusional. Trump is strong here in Alabama. McConnell and Rove are not. Luther is McConnell's candidate and we know it. Getting his vote out and picking up enough votes to beat Roy Moore will be very difficult.

"
0,"The scary thing about Trump or candidates like him, is he was not vetted as to his tax returns, and security clearance (as far as I know).  How is this possible?  Is it that easy to take over as a President, Dictator, or whatever, without a thorough FBI background and security check.  Or, is the FBI involved in this facade as well?  A strange time in America or is it Amerika?

"
0,"Justin Trudeau will feel the back of Trump's hand if he even attempts a pivot around a NAFTA issue.  He'll land laughing like he did in his election antic down the staircase, but Mr. MacNaughton is correct in his advice to attempt a transversal over differences rather than a pivot; i.e.,  """"articulate our values, the values of Canadians, in terms of generosity and inclusiveness and tolerance, ...  more in the sense of reasserting as Canadians our values as they apply to each other, not doing it in a pointed  'we are and they’re not'  way.""""  In other words, attempt to traverse  """"différance"""" ( Jacques Derrida) rather than emphasize distinct differences.
"
1,"Disgusting using his government office and connections to further his personal agenda.  He should really face sanction.  He says clients should hear honest opinions, but communication between lawyer and client is not broadcast to the world at large.  Imagine a lawyer representing a client who sent adverse advice to the client and copied it to the news media.  Disbarment warranted.  The man's lack of professionalism speaks volumes about those who come to work for the government.  Finally, Trump has not rejected climate change.

0,"So ISIS claims credit.  Now, we can anticipate the following: 1. Congressional Republicans will say that it's inappropriate to talk about gun control after a mass shooting 2. the NRA will defend the right to own assault-style weapons 3. Alex Jones (Trump: """"Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down"""") will claim that the shooting was a """"false flag"""" and the """"victims"""" were really actors 4. Trump will dedicate a golf trophy to the victims

"
1,"Trump surrounds himself with sleazy people. Millions of tax dollars wasted taking military planes. Trump is a below average President and a disappointment. Trump has turned out to be rather stupid.
"
1,"You have just said that the vast majority of Canadians are rather dumb. Because they """"cannot stand Trump"""", they will refuse to consider anything of value in the article. Such people will not be finding solutions to the social fighting and violence.
"
0,"It's true that the White House invitation should be above politics, it should be an honour.  But under Trump though everything is the pettiest of politics - if it were otherwise the President of the United States would not have stooped to tweet a public humiliation through rescinding the invitation.  Curry's on the right side of this temporary President.
"
0,"When the sad inevitable happens, and terrorists target Trump branded buildings...what will he do, enlist the USA forces to protect his business interests?????  The potential destruction of his brand may well see him resign, his brand is more important to him than being President or anything, including what is good for the American public.
"
1,"You're kidding right?  This perspective irks me. Not to single you out, as I've seen this from all sorts of people, but there's this dichotomy that's set up between Trump and the media. The real problem is that the true dichotomy is often between Trump and objective facts. That kinda forces responsible journalists to take an anti-Trump position.  If anything I'd argue the media was unfairly biased towards Trump simply because there isn't enough space and time to report on all the reportable idiotic and horrific things he did or said daily.
"
0,"46% of American voters are total suckers : Jeff Sessions came straight out of the Washington swamp. . Trump's emergency plan to ban Muslims is a failure. Trump's secret plan to defeat ISIS is to use Obama`s plan. Trump's secret plan to replace Obama Care with something much better, is not to call it Obama Care. . Plus, best of all ................ Mexico told Trump where to shove his wall.

"
0,"By any math, a crowd of 6000 supporters in Montreal is more impressive than a little online club of 6 detractors. There are millions of people throughout the world who want to remind themselves, after six months of the loud alternative, what a President of intellect and dignity looks like. All the Trumpers can do is gripe in their usual bitterness, making sure to look the other way while their silver-spoon hero runs his sleazy family business openly from the Oval Office.

0,"Successive US presidents wreak havoc in the ME with complicit Arab dictatorships and now Trump walks away from refugees his predecessors help create. If NATO had not been so misguided with encircling Russia Putin wouldn't have been compelled to push back in Crimea and Ukraine.

0,"Comey was incompetent and that was why Trump fired him in my opinion. Just look at the way he handled Clintons email server debacle last year.
"
1,"It's ridiculous to see anyone try to rationalize Trump's moronically immature attacks. It doesn't matter how partisan, stupidly liberal, and shallow Morning Joe is, or that these two hosts are typical coastal libs, it's beneath the office of President to get into these little spats, period. When people try to justify Trump's stupidity they sound like parents of a misbehaved teen, trying to cover up the objectively bad behavior in a stage of denial.  The reason it sounds that way is because Trump is basically a bratty adolescent in need of a good kick in the pants. So stop trying to rationalize or President's behavior!
"
0,"Allie, I know a lot of Republicans and not one would agree to such a letter, not ONE. I cannot believe the SA would publish such a letter. Maybe an obnoxious letter from a Black Lives Matter member should be published as well, but that won't happen. Don't you find it odd that a vast majority of all of the letters, editorials, articles posted seem to bash one party? What the readers need is a little more balance or articles supporting why one should support Democratic policies, and not only why Republicans are bad. It reminds me of watching CNN or MSNBC. Turn to one of those stations for 30 seconds. Odds are they will be in the midst of basking Trump or the Party. Recall Hillary calling Republicans """"deplorable""""? Maybe that """"works"""" in Hawaii but it doesn't work nationally. Certain media that 90% plus of the time support one party is not healthy. Here's the irony, if you're wealthy or in power (in HI), being a Democrat makes sense. If you're trying to """"move up"""", better think again.

0,"In broad terms Donald Trump's Gospel is the prosperity Gospel on steroids.  He is the archetype of the """"Power of Positive Thinking"""" of Norman Vincent Peale, whom he knew well and was influenced by him.

If Bryce loses, it will be because of his socks. If Trump has had it with Ryan, Bryce will win. Trump can talk to the silk-stocking crowd at least as well as Ryan can.  Nice turn of phrase but, to be frank, I'd rather let the Dems continue their self-imploding free fall. I want Hillary to dance the Lindy Hop again (I fear the poor girl doesn't have many dances left) and pull her hot sauce out of her purse. Maybe next time she could bring some soy sauce, too and vodka, too. Nothing like a couple gutter-mouthed women to prove that you mean business, by golly.

0,"Donald Trump has touched a nerve. The corporate Bush's and Graham's and their roadies can not tolerate a person like Trump who tells all of us who the men behind the curtain are. They are trying to save their relevance in this world and it has a chance of coming to end. (If they don't arrange for someone to pop a cap in him). Thank Jesus!!! All the name calling at Trump doesn't make any difference he just throws it back at them. The real bullies in this world have been the Chaney's, Clinton's, Bushes, etc...and the whole insidious system.

You are not racially profiled, even though most cops are killed by white men.

0,"Orally, one judge suggested the Administration could slow processing of Visas while updating the program for security. He questioned why the Visa Program evaluation report was not completed because it was already due under the first Executive Order.  In 2011, the Obama Administration updated the vetting for Iraqi refugees, slowing entry from 18,251 in 2010 to 6,339 in 2011. Judge Watson's ruling that the Order is not discriminatory on its face, but is invalid due to implied intention has unintended consequences. Can the courts now halt drone attacks in the Mideast based on Trump's implied ill will towards Muslims? Is Trump hostile towards Muslims? He said at the National Prayer meeting, """"We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered, and oppressed by ISIS killers."""" He said his tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture “was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.”

They are the people Trump described, not in a terribly flattering way either, as his supporters who would watch him shoot someone and still vote for him.  They are those who believed him when he told them he could make them a millionaire at his Trump University.  Look, a con man knows his mark, and through all of this, he has never tried to convince anyone of anything; he only preached (and a well-worn sermon it is) to his marks.

That about sums up how sick it is about the Vancouver economy and the failure of the successive government, the city and the province.  While the realtors are downplaying the impact of price hype  by foreign buyers, then they are reluctant to collect information about foreign buyers, at the same time acknowledging foreign fund flow in 'mysterious way', they are speaking from both sides of the mouth.  The outcome is that the ordinary working, young Canadians are screwed.  Real estate agents may soon (or already) have the same reputation as the sleazy used car salesmen or lawyers.  Not fair to the honest ones, but when greed trumps basic ethics and business practice brought in from that 'GDP is everything ' country, and government fails to act for our own citizen, that's what happen.

Sanctuary is the answer but make sure you are not an easy target for Bannon to figure out.

There is some reported intelligence that this pressure is causing some internal issues in NK which could result in changes or internal moves against Kim. Like a Chess match, we have seen generals (they sent the message) have a relatively """"weak"""" position-- shooting missiles off of Guam with no threat of nuclear. This lets Trump respond after what they and not have to back up his words now. This gives at least a week for anyone in North Korea with a chance to takeout or contain Kim to do so (if there is truth to intelligence of sudden instability in N.

Republican leaders criticized the process that led to the Affordable Care Act; but that process was slow, deliberate and transparent compared to this process.

The players involved have made it crystal clear from the beginning what they were protesting, and it was not the flag or the national anthem. This is a fact. It was clearly about the social injustice that exists in our country, and the social injustice that is expanding under a clueless president. Trump has brought racism into the mainstream, and his past comments and actions show that it's very clear that he supports racism and white nationalists. There are videos, tweets, and audio recordings that prove this. There is no disputing it, although Trump supporters will somehow blame Hillary or Obama for this. Trump's followers have gotten to be a joke, and the more they speak up supporting Trump's bizarre words and actions, the more of a joke it is.

I know that Ontario currently has an electricity surplus and that many electric cars could be charged overnight without any additional supply required from the grid (so users will save on purchasing gas). Solar arrays are being built and delivering electrical power at less cost than the cost to extract oil because of manufacturing economics (the more we build and innovate around solar array manufacturing, the less the cost).  The biggest challenge is how to store the electric power for times when the sun is not shining/wind not blowing. There are solutions for this and some are underway now in smaller settings but they certainly can be adopted in Canada (e.g. pump water into a reservoir and release it to power turbines). There will certainly be a significant transition period but like Donald Trump and other coal proponents, they will be left in the economic debris of these less economic alternatives.

In order for there to be a turn-around I think the country will have to hit absolute rock bottom in the form of a genuine Great Depression of the sort that President Obama steered us away from after George Bush nearly drove the economy off the cliff. Only then will the people who put Trump in office realize their mistake. I thought we had hit rock bottom when Bush left office, but I guess Obama's saving of the economy, including the resuscitation of the auto industry, increased drilling in the oil sector which has helped with the current low price of oil, all worked against Democratic interests since most people in this country seem to have a five-minute attention span and have forgotten just how bad things were when Obama took office. So now we will have to vomit everything back up again in order to rid ourselves of the disease of Trumpism. Things won't get better until they get much, much worse, and they will. Trust me.

They are laughing in Washington because this plan is exactly what Trump demanded the allies start doing!

0,"Greggore, you struggle to see past your own biases.  You accuse the G&M of being """"bias(sic) against Trump"""".  What you see as bias is just the media doing the due diligence of reporting information as it becomes available.  If you don't like what is being revealed about Mr. Trump, his campaign and his administration, blame him, not those bringing information to light.  Shooting the messenger usually wounds the shooter worse than the messenger.  Hoping everyone will just shut up about Mr. Trump's mistakes and transgressions just serves to highlight your bias.  .

Was it last year or two, former President Barack Hussein Obama  wanted to strike the same Syrian military base, but first ask Congress for persmission.  Congress never took up the matter because of opposition by Obama's own political party. Well now, President Donald Trump is more action than cheap talk. Remember when Obama warned the Assad regime that if they cross that """"red line"""" they will receive some consequences. Syria's Assad cross that red line, and Obama retreated. . .

When her email scandal became public, again the Rebulicans went full bore on the offence.

To firm up their support and the alt-right/racist groups that adore him, I predict he will next demand that all gay men and lesbians be kicked-out of the military.   Then it will be women need to go.   And just to assure the purity of the U.S. military once more, African-Americans and anyone not wearing a cross along with their dog tags (i.e. Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists,  etc.) will not be wanted anymore.

0,"Joanna777, quoting Wielechowski on oil and gas tax policy is like quoting Trump on immigration policy- you're moving beyond facts to demagoguery.  Read the state's revenue sources book published in December. The state did bring in $89MM in production tax. But when you add royalties, property tax, and corporate income tax, the state actually brought in $2.1B in total FY '16 revenue from oil companies. ACES would have brought us less according to DoR. The budget shortfall is because low oil prices, not the underlying oil tax structure.  For FY '17 the state owes about $600MM in cashable tax credits. This is because the Governor vetoed paying tax credits for the last two years- not because they were all generated in one year. Assuming the same happens this year, the total grows to around $900MM by FY '18. On top of that, the Legislature ended many of those credits last year with HB 247. We can debate the policy of offering credits to explorers but that's an argument for a later thread.

IF we're going to build a world where there's an offense-o-meter, and IF we're going to hold people responsible all over our modern society for their statements, and IF we're going to get into the odious business of forcing apologies, retractions, or possibly even pressuring people to step down or be dismissed, then it should be evenly applied.  If this kind of comment would get someone fired if the target were NOT Trump, then it should get someone fired if the target IS Trump. In my opinion, forcing equal results for equal statements is the single best way to create more free speech advocates. You only have to unfairly see your job toasted once before you'll rethink your participation in viral campaigns to get people fired.

We were attacked in 1941, and now over 75 years later, we are probably going to be attacked by North Korea.  Only this time, we will be limited to a 20-minute warning, and even if Trump tries to save us, he probably won't be able since he doesn't even know where our aircraft carriers are (see location of USS Vinson when Trump thought it was near North Korea)!

Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.”  “The continuing counterintelligence investigation means that Mr. Trump will take the oath of office on Friday with his associates under investigation and after the intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government had worked to help elect him. As president, Mr. Trump will oversee those agencies and have the authority to redirect or stop at least some of these efforts.”  So tons of reports and leaks show surveillance.

0,"Fox has made a nice living for itself by twisting the facts for right wingers, and the most reputable news outlets (NPR, NYT, WP, a few others) have decided to try their hand at doing the same for left-wingers. But, it's useful to consider the fact that of the three labels people could use to describe their political viewpoint (liberal, moderate, conservative), in descending order more identify as conservative than any other group, then close behind are moderates, and then several points behind, liberals.  It's not too late for one of those news outlets to, figuratively speaking at least, sit down, take a breath, and resolve to cover news with the minimum political bias possible. At this point, it would be like a cool breeze on a hot humid day.  I don't like Donald Trump, few people can stand his type, even the people who voted for him. But, if feelings about the man cloud your ability to think about what he is doing, then you are not thinking rationally. That's it.

0,"I've been thinking along those lines since the split between Trump and the """"Freedom Caucus"""" became a yawning gap. So Trump asks Bernie Sanders to draft a comprehensive health care plan; he finds a member of the House, preferably a Republican, to introduce it;  and then throws himself into the effort to get it passed.  He loses every member of the Freedom Caucus; he gets every Democrat; and the outcome swings on Republican members who represent more moderate constituencies, and whose offices, town halls, mail boxes, email and social media will be bombarded by voters who don't want to lose health insurance or health care. This effort wouldn't make Trump's Russia problems go away; but it would probably push them into the background, for a little while.

Indeed, your prediction that Congress will pass some kind of amnesty is predicated on Congress contemplating """"what if"""" in an election year.

Because progressives want to get the job done, now, without the politics - for the people.  The problem with the Democratic party (my opinion) is they let politicians, unions, big business run over them.  The people are tired of politics as usual. The people are struggling to make ends meet and hoping some entity will throw them a life line. Are we the democratic party that throws the life line or are we too caught up in the politics to make a huge difference like Bernie Sanders would?

0,"I'm not sure you really understand the American democratic system.  There are three branches with counterbalancing responsibility.  The other two are congress and the courts.

0,"I have no problem with the Church's concern for reality  if the Church confines that concern to it's own reality.  The gay marriage issue was a secular issue, not a religious issue.  The reality for gays is they did not enjoy the same secular advantages in benefits and tax structure that married straights did.  Even if a gay or lesbian couple was raising children, and many of these couples were raising their own biological children, they could not qualify for many benefits to help raise that child.  This was a secular issue, not a religious issue.  I would hope you wouldn't have backed a political campaign to support the religiously defined 'reality' of the Southern Baptist Convention when it was using the bible to politically institute Jim Crow laws. But once you step down the road of insisting a religious reality should trump secular reality I don't see how you can avoid supporting another religion using the same rationale unless....you advocate for a Catholic theocracy.

Or if you had a policy and you contracted something like cancer, they would dig through your medical records to find some condition on which to deny you coverage for that illness. Trump's proposal would return us to that era. Should we be surprised that he campaigned on a promise that his plan would cover everybody and be cheaper, but he is doing just the opposite?

And now another member of the administration is disparaging the results of a college election -- score more points for Russia who is not a fan of Democracy. Even if it is like playing international speed clock chess, with wee folk as the pawns.  Each of these flame outs BY the administration on how US democratic processes are failing because Trump doesn't like the results ... he is literally scoring points for those who would like our democracy to fail.  The present moment calls for the emphasis on this administration. There aren't nuances to this scale. I'm pro-Democracy... Not a Democrat nor a Republican.

0,"There are plenty of disturbing and unethical practices taking place within the Trump White House without wasting effort lamenting his unfortunate enthusiasm for spray tans or his infantile communication style.  How about the fact that he personally profits from every off-site Presidential meeting held at his properties in New York or Florida? How about the fact that his baseless claims of electoral fraud are leading to real laws that are disenfranchising millions of Americans? How about the fact that foreign powers have already started bribing him to get what they want and it's working?  A lot of people seem preoccupied with their belief that Donald Trump looks and acts like a child.  What's more alarming is that they're ignoring the fact that his conflicts of interest have begun to have a DIRECT impact on US Government policy... and he's only been in power a few weeks.

0,"Trump took a completely legal deduction, otherwise the state and federal tax authorities would have made him pay the taxes. If you don't like it, the ones to criticize are those who made the tax laws or allowed them to stand. Since Hillary Clinton was a Senator, she falls in this category. Trump does not.  Criticizing Trump for taking a legal deduction is logically the same as saying he should have paid more than he was legally required to pay. Unless a person taking this stance pays more taxes than they are legally required to pay, or they at least require anyone they would vote for President to do so, then they are a hypocrite seeking a particular political outcome as the only reason for their hypocrisy.  By the way, no candidate for President is required to release their taxes. It's an option. When someone else obtains and releases them, it's a crime. That should be the story here, and we as citizens should not tolerate such a thing. We still get to vote for whomever we wish.

Is there anything you can do at this stage to contribute something constructive to this process? You got caught up in the attention of your candidacy, never seriously wanting the office as even today you have no detailed plans to explain your policies but it got away from you and you became the candidate.  There is time to do a little positive work. First, apologize to the Nation, you ran off the viable candidates and left the country with only one candidate who can present as Presidential. Policy-Presentation each have equal weight. Presentation you score zero and your opponent eight. Policies, each get a five, depends on voter preferences. Final score Trump - 5. Clinton - 13. Not close. So, share the spotlight with candidates who can promote your same policies, help them with some free advertising and encourage voters who may not vote,  to vote for them. Votes count.

0,"There is a tendency in people's comments to see the US's growing isolationism as all Trump, but he was elected by a very significant portion of American voters to take exactly such a policy direction. Should Trump suddenly leave the international political stage, it would be undemocratic for his replacement to radically alter this approach. I doubt that he will leave early, and he may win a second term. How far the US will move towards isolationism is hard to say, but for NATO members and other US allies, alternative trade and defense alliances must be considered. Canada should seriously examine the possibility of joining in a European armaments production and defense alliance if that is Europe's decision. I don't suggest that we should abandon the US, but we should be prepared for the possibility of further US isolationism.
"
0,"Trump is rejecting the neo-liberal, free trade consensus of  the Clintons, but his part in Congress mostly has not.  Whether they change in response to his victory is doubtful.  Also doubtful is whether there will be much social retrenchment on abortion or gay marriage.  I suspect his upcoming appointment to the Supreme Court will reflect the best the ABA has to offer - moderate conservatives on economic issues and liberal on social issues.  The moderate Republicans will get their way and the blue collar ones will not, even with Trump's best efforts.  Interestingly, some claim Trump is a Democrat in sheep's clothing.  This could very well be true, although some of his appointments are still pandering to the right.
"
0,"Yes, especially in health care and education, those currently getting fat with income will fight any change vigorously.  Radically different more productive models can be envisioned but will be blocked by those who would lose easy riches.  Hillary, IMHO, would never touch the entrenched interests.  I am hoping that iconoclastic Trump will actually try to make improvements.  The school voucher system, for example, that we are already seeing attacked by the so called liberals (who really only want to protect their lucrative positions) could introduce competition and productivity increase into education.  Health care is probably impossible to fix.  The entrenched beneficiaries of the massive costs and barriers to competition have massive power.  Likely no one can fix the system.  Obamacare did nothing to control cost or increase efficiency.

The lack of vision is glaring by Trump's pursuit of the almighty dollar to fill the coffers of American armaments industry.  The fact that there was a Saudi led conference that only exacerbates a strife within a religion is noteworthy in the fact that Trump is openly playing sides.  Of course Putin is more than willing to sell arms to Iran.  What is missing is open, non biased dialogue by Trump.  The biggest fantasy is for him to try to tie Saudi Arabia and Israel against Iran.  The world's leaders are uniting against the clumsy attempts by Trump to breakup the European Union and NATO, torpedo multi lateral economic frameworks, have a military only foreign policy, and, most importantly, to not stand up for human rights around the world.

The money that allowed Trump to win was all billionaire dark money, not subject to limitations owing to Citizens United. The billionaires, when Trump gathered momentum, shoveled money into TV ads. Even so, Hillary won the popular vote by three million. Now we have Trump, and insane man with attention deficit disorder, playing Nero while Rome burns. That's the present and the future. The Clintons are old news. Also, Motley, you are a knee-jerk, minus the knee and the hyphen.

His responsibility as a self employed private sector citizen was to his company, family and employees.  Government is ware money goes to die period. Who can truly say they paid extra out of the goodness of their harts? Who can say they wouldn't take advantage of any legal loopholes?  If the establishment is so horrified with Trumps tax returns they should have closed the loopholes over the last 8 years and chosen Bernie over Hillary.

1,"Another way of looking at Trump's discourse, so well described by Kendzior as lying, is to call it what lies beyond lying. What Yale philosopher Harry Frankfurt has called: """"bullshit"""".

Bullshit is worse than lies, he says,  because it has parted company from objective inquiry--anything goes.. Frankfurt wrote his   book titled """" On Bullshit"""" 10 years ago. Prescient. An essay for our times.

I hold this country and our flag dear to me heart but without hesitation I can say, They are dishonoring the flag and the people that have fought for it. There are many injustices in this country but we must work together to rectify them. If you go anywhere else in this world those same injustices are exponentially worse. When will these protests end?  During WWII, America had internment camps. Should I start waiting for the Asian American protests?  Currently in this country our Muslim population is being vilified and judged. When will the Muslim American contingent start dishonoring our flag? This countries Latino population, I feel, is by far the most persecuted and judged. Where is their voice? Does the current NFL player represent them in their protest against the flag and those who fought for it? Please rethink these misguided protests. BTW Trump is an ass.

The incoming tide cannot be stemmed, now. The genie is out of the bottle. During a time of high unemployment, I think immigration should be curtailed, not the other way around! Moreover, I cringed when I read in McLeans a few years ago that Europe was overrun by Muslims and that now they are manipulating the outcome of elections. That has started happening here. Far too many Canadians have their heads in the sand, including the government. Too late to regret.

0,"(ONE)  Mike, I don't think there are """"rational reasons"""" as to  why Trump became Putin's lapdog for the intelligence community to uncover; and IMHO you attribute way too much intelligent forethought to Trump in suggesting Trump wants to undermine in advance their potential revelations.  I suggest the best approach to understanding what Trump says is to search for """"psychological reasons"""" rather than """"rational reasons.""""  For instance.  The unshakable truth at the core of DT's being is that he is the brightest, smartest (just look at is wealth), best looking, most attractive (just look at his wife) male that God has ever made; and this core truth ALONE explains why he ALWAYS SUCCEEDS at everything. This is not DT's truth, but rather a most core truth of the universe.  Therefore, if he had lost the election, it necessarily would have been because that election was rigged, but since he won, then of course the SOLE explanation for the Trump's victory is this universal truth.

There is very little difference in the two parties. Both full of corporate corruption.

What Congresswoman Wilson seems to be insulted by in this whole sad he-said-she-said mess is the tone of his message as she perceived it.  The reality is it probably didn't matter what the president might say or how he said it, Ms. Wilson would have been offended merely by the fact that he made the call.  The fact that the president took a moment to show compassion does not fit with the narcissistic bully monster that he is portrayed in our sadly lopsided media. It is sad that Ms. Wilson, who has been a outspoken critic of the president since the morning after the last election has chosen such an auspicious event to attempt to make political hay ... an empty barrel!

Because the Democrats and liberals are now calling for Mueller's release we feel that the incitements that will come down tomorrow will be against the Clintons.

Many more people would have come out to vote and a huge majority of the nonvoters would have voted for Obama.

Trump only received the support of 26% of eligible voters, Clinton received 31%. Forty-three percent of eligible voters didn't bother voting. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Trump won the electoral vote, which gives some Americans' vote almost 4 times more power than other Americans.

1,"The best thing Canada can do for its high tech industries is to vote out the likes of Junior, Wynne and Notley..  They are doing more to hurt the high tech and manufacturing industries that help it. They have imposed higher taxes on Canada's highest income earners.  Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.   That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.

Notre Dame must invite President Trump. EXACTLY FOR THE REASONS THEY STATED BEFORE. . Archbishop Chaput must vehemently protest the """"shameful"""" invitation and publicly promise to boycott the event. EXACTLY FOR THE REASONS HE STATED BEFORE.  Any other outcomes would mean in 2009 they really didn't mean what they said. I don't think ND or the archbishop wants to be accused of hypocrisy or situational ethics.

0,"The GOP elite failed to deliver time after time, not the Tea Party partisans. They were warned repeatedly that putting up candidates like Bush and Romney, the focus-group tested products of decades of political sausage-making, who weighed every move for the possibility of offending constituents - not the people who elected them but the people who funded them - was going to blow up in their faces.  The Democratic elite were facing a similar problem, and they ran the focus-group tested product of decades of political sausage-making.  To people who had seen their insurance, pension, and jobs disappear while the talking heads of both parties gave scripted public shows, Trump was refreshing. The wilder the comments the more they cheered, not because they believed he would do the things he said, but because by his willingness to offend anyone and everyone he was destroying the Potemkin village of our national political structure.  And he has.

0,"Trump will prevail.  His executive order is legal... period.  Appeal court used his statements during the campaign as evidence of his intent.  The President has access to classified information that the courts are not privy to.  That's why the law gives the President broad powers to set immigration policy.  The courts have devolved to the point where they are now psychics who divine what's in people's hearts and minds and make their ruling accordingly.  It would be funny if it wasn't so scary.

0,"Once Trump got tired of hearing himself explain how great he was, it was time to share the duty with others. That big smacking sound was each Trump appointee taking his or her turn at telling Trump what a wonderful man he is, how right he is about everything, and how much everyone loves him. At Trump’s behest, each member of the cabinet took just a moment to explain how much they love Donald Trump. Do you love me, Mike? Do you love me Jeff? Scott? Betsy? Other than the eye-rolling level of sycophancy, the cabinet meeting might not seem to have held any purpose. But it did.  It allowed Trump to scan his cabinet and make sure that a majority of his department heads weren’t lining up to Amendment 25 him to the sidelines. Instead he got a full volley of glorious, reassuring ego-stroking and pledges of obedience.  See James Comey? See Preet Bharara? This is how it’s supposed to be done.

0,"What did Trump do but tell the truth that many women would like for a billionaire, movie star or someone famous or powerful to grope them?  I suppose so they get some of that money, fame or power.  You can't deny the truth that women have used their sexual appeal to attract the rich, famous and powerful.  Obviously a lot of women allowed Weinstein to do worse to advance their careers, without making an issue of it when it happened.  I'm glad to see people standing up to people who abuse their power for their personal sexual satisfaction.  But Democrats excused Bill Clinton's abuse, as Caldera said, for politics.  I'm glad to see at least some of them have changed their minds.

As long as Canada let so much of its export go to the U.S. it will be subject to U.S. imposing the terms. NAFTA or not. In many ways, Trump exiting NAFTA will do a lot of long-term good for Canada. For sure there will be a whole lot of short-term pain as Congress or USTR imposes anything they feel like. But it is precisely this pain that will propel Canada to implement a more sound diversification strategy with urgency. Make us grow up.  There is however one naive thing Canada permits. And that is allowed unfettered U.S. investment and access to Canada. Buying up a whole lot of things.

We can know his motives about it being a Muslim ban. He has said it was. b. He lied about the physical size of his inauguration crowd - you diverted to viewership.  Again, this about him being a pathological liar. When he makes claims in speeches, Facebook, or Twitter very often he states blatant lies or makes entirely baseless hearsay claims. I am wondering if you have the ability to understand what a fact is or isn't. Scary.  2. To this most recent statement what are you even trying to say? You must submit to his ideas while still holding your own, also federal law is a thing? You're not even making sense.  President Trump is not the law. He too must submit to the law. That is why a 'muslim ban' is illegal the same way murder is illegal. Neither I or him can break the law. Doesn't matter what we agree or disagree on.

Trump is really rich, graduated from a really good college, and lives in a  condo that's better than almost every other condo ever (plus he lives in the Whitehouse).  As a successful businessman, he should have no problem building the wall and dealing with all the stuff that needs to be done to get it done.  So, the legislation should just authorize him to do it, and then get repaid (EXCLUSIVELY, with no other recourse) from the Mexico money he guaranteed would come.  I'm sure he would agree to that.  It's consistent with what he said.  I think his base would support him and provide free labor, or wait for Mexico$

0,"The irony is that the Republicans---who have gerrymandered and rigged local, state and national elections for some time---could not (or would not) rig their own presidential primary. Meanwhile, the Democratic party establishment-Clinton-machine, systematically purchased, lied, cheated and rigged one primary after another to get Mrs. Clinton an apparent nomination. The Democratic party faces the Republican problem in reverse---progressive voters don't care for Mrs. Clinton...but if she gets the nomination, Bernie supporters will either field Mr. Sanders as an independent candidate...or hold Hillary hostage to a pretty thorough revamping of the crooked democratic party platform and election process. One difference is that the crooked  Mrs. Clinton party machine is somewhat focused...where Mr. Trump is all over the place...and the Republican party is already disintegrated into a pathetic blob of wishful thinking as represented by this article and reflected in some of the comments here.

0,"""""Poor President Moon...""""  Right.  But for the US, SK would be under the rule of lunatic NK dictator, Kim.  The SK's insist that the US pay billions for their defense -- e.g. THAAD -- while they rack up a huge trade  surplus with unfair practices -- e.g. high tariffs on US imports and low tariffs on exports to the US.  The SKs have had 64 years to get reasonable shelters and plans in place for war.  NK, which is much poorer, has managed effective preparation, but most SKs just can't be bothered.  Now the US is supposed to forego its own defense because SK might suffer if the US attempts to disarm NK, which currently shows no sign of wanting to negotiate.  President Trump's first responsibility is to provide for the US' defense.  If that means pursuing the military option and SK suffers because it has not prepared properly, then that's SK's problem, not the US'.  Mr Trump needs to do what he needs to do to protect American lives and jobs.  If Moon & SK suffer as a result, then too bad.

If the North Koreans cross the line, it will be lights out for them.  Everything depends on whether Communist China , if they think that, for the first time they were facing an US President who would actually act, that he was not the usual predictable US paper tiger and  not wanting to see millions of starving North Koreans crossing into China disrupting it , with the US appearing at the banks of Yalu River--might act to curb the leadership, remove it even.

Rather than creating his own youth movement 𝒅𝒆 𝒏𝒐𝒗𝒐 as Hitler did, Trump in his speech was trying to coopt an existing organization with a rich, tradition-filled history of its own, to use for his own political ends.

0,"It is abundantly clear that the large number of players now kneeling are really protesting against Trump's rant that questioned all athletes right to protest.  Kapernick's kneeling was virtually a non story. It was non violent, non verbal, and was not really even catching on with other players.  Then the orange headed embarrassment of a POTUS weighed in with over the top remarks suggesting that these largely innocuous gestures should result in a firing.  Telling any citizen of the USA that a non violent freedom of expression should cause ones career to end is obviously far more disrespectful than kneeling during an anthem! It defies a constitutional right.  Who can know when or how this will end?  But one thing is for certain, Donald Trump is to blame for this fiasco.

There is now nothing to prevent the new DIRFBI from undertaking the long overdue investigation of the treasonous Felony-Shrillary. 2.  ISIS is losing considerable turf before he onslaught of US and  coalition forces. Unlike our 44th “president”, Donald is not one to cut and run. 3.  His meeting with Lavrov today is a single step on a worthwhile journey 4.  Congress has in fact allocated funds for wall repair and maintenance 5.  Trump has lit a rag under the nether parts of the weenie Republicans in Congress to let them know it is time to fish or cut bait. Status quo ain't gonna hack it.

0,"The climate change response commission is an excellent idea! Alaska suffers more than any other state in the union from the impact of climate change - whether an Oklahoma lawyer or Donald Trump choose to believe in it or not! Basic staffing for one or two people  could be funded from  The proposed increase to gasoline taxes, or from minorreductions to incentive subsidies  for exploration. The importance increases, given the attitudes and staffing reductions that are occurring to the EPA, the Coast Guard and every  other Service or analyticfederal agency that greatly impacts Alaska. Cost for this piece of legislation would be no more and probably less than the piece funding ANWAR tours  for congressman. I could also support that legislation, if it included mandatory stopovers to dialogue with the subsistence living villages of ANWAR.

Trump had the opportunity to fire Comey on his very first day in office. For whatever reason he chose not to. Suddenly acting all concerned that poor Hillary Clinton wasn't given a fair shake because of Comey now, on the eve of Comey's congressional testimony for the Russia investigation, is so disingenuous on Trump's part as to be utterly laughable. In myriad ways this fails the smell test. The stench of rot at the heart of this new administration is starting to spread well beyond Washington.

For NATO, it's one thing to insist that other members increase their commitments (the US has been doing that for a long time), but to do so while at the same time praising an enemy of the US is appalling. Please take a second to step back and try to look at this situation objectively. Everything Trump says about Putin and Russia is glowingly positive, while his tone to the entire rest of the world is belligerent and dismissive. How can you possibly rationalize that difference? How can brown-nosing to a ruthless autocrat be compatible with being the leader of the free world?  Can you imagine Nixon having come into office saying that Khrushchev is a better leader than LBJ was? He would've been indicted for treason.  Just watch: In the near future Trump is going to try to lift sanctions against Russia. He will offer rationalizations, all will be absurd propaganda.

0,"Upon further reflection, it was his activist mentality that was divisive. We felt he was not POTUS for all of America. Just those who agreed with him. He constantly talked down about half of this country. So did Hillary. Her """"deplorables"""" comment was so tone deaf, and it is still used even so. And what did that get us? You got it. As much as Mr. Obama denies it, Trump was the answer to Obama's elitist, globalist attitudes.

0,"I totally agree with you.  It's too much for a reasonable person to comprehend and so it all takes on a surreal quality.  It doesn't help that the Trump administration is purposely conflating issues and now it's becoming impossible to even prioritize the real dangers from the petty or purposely manipulative stuff.  For instance,  is he serious with all this North Korean saber rattling or just  manipulating the news media away from reporting on his multiple failures.

1,"Yes and no. It has to do with police brutality, but it is being protested using the wrong format. No matter how you want to paint it, to kneel during the National Anthem is a slap in the face of the fallen soldiers and our AMERICAN flag. I don't mind them protesting, but they used the wrong forum and disrespected many of us. Also, they used their platform on the one day when all Americans want to do is watch football. To get AWAY from politics. They have all this money and can use it in other ways to support their issue, not force us to watch them embarrass themselves by protesting in the wrong manner, using Americas symbols. It is the same as spitting on all of us Americans who respect the flag and the soldiers who bled and died for it. They don't like what Trump said? Get over it. All I can say to them is that life sucks, wear a helmet.

See for too long they both have failed America, especially in congress, and for the last 8 years on the world stage as far as the presidency! America deserves better than the two parties long owned, long ignoring the people and the common man, beholden to everything from Wall Street to people like the Koch brothers and Soros, both which lost the last election. Democrats tried with Mr. Sanders, whom Hillary Clinton and the DNC shunned and media (CNN) cheated; the Republicans with Mr.Trump who used his own money or small donors as Mr. Sander relied on, Mr. Trump even telling the Koch brothers to go sit on a block of ice, he had his own money.

There is good reason to have a civil international relationship with Russia.   That doesn't mean you become an ally to their policy, domestic or foreign.  Russian has an authoritative leadership that is willing to murder opponents, both their own people and those of other nations.  The Russian economy is a corrupted wreck, they have a poor record in innovation, science, and even the arts.    When all things must be 'sanctioned' by the state you destroy creative change.    In our country, we hold leadership responsible, I suggest we do the same with Putin and his party.   President Trump's assertion that he is a great leader is an insult to American principles.

Not enough """"environmental stuff"""" is being done to improve the quality of people's lives.  The international community is moving toward greater environmental conservation, while the United States is moving toward greater commercialization of environmental resources - which means greater health costs, greater environmental elitism, and greater environmental burden (maybe that's what Trump meant by """"making America great again."""")  People should stop seeing environmental conservation as an impediment to rights and livelihoods; just see it as keeping the world healthy, so future generations can live.  Because that's the truth.

If the Democrats had spent half as much energy defending this marginalized class of people as they did the illegal immigrants in America they could have won.

Walter Ong in his published study “Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word” well describes the savage like talk issued by Trump in the section “Some psychodynamics of orality” in which the speech of primitives was filled with “verbal combat,” “dozens,” “bragging of one’s own prowess,” “verbal tongue-lashing,” “agonistic name-calling,” and when promise cures . . . are infrequent” just “invent new shrines . . . entirely devoid of a human action context.” This and more covered by Ong under the subsection “Sounded word as power and action”---for Chief Trump and his warrior tribe.

Trust me, it is very effective and works.

IMHO, Trump is one tactical piece of a larger Russian strategy to regain lost influence in the world, Eastern Europe in particular, and to protect the Russians' oil and gas exports that support Russia's oligarchic power structure.  Connecting the dots suggest that the Russians' deal with Trump was to provide covert assistance during the election plus investment in his and Kushner's failing projects in return for Trump's tacit support of their strategy.  The Russians real objectives are to separate the US from European allies while simultaneously filling the US influence vacuum left behind with Russian influence, reduce the forward momentum of global greenhouse gas reduction initiatives that ultimately reduces their oil and gas revenue, and to reverse the global trend towards liberal democracy from oligarchic rule.  Trump is only one piece on their chess board.

Egypt (its domestic stability being key to US regional policy) relies significantly on the remittances by Egyptian nationals who work in Qatar.  It is true that, while Qatar in several ways plays a modernizing & moderating role in the region, it also serves unofficially as a conduit for funds for ISI, but so does Saudi Arabia and its allies in making these demands.  The Saudis made these demands shortly after Trump's visit & the US remains very silent throughout.

Right now, in the Sahara, acres upon acres of solar panels are being installed. It has been suggested, that once the project is complete, it can supply Europe with all its energy needs.

But here in Venezuela-North, oil may be Canada's largest export, but the incompetent and delusional Liberals have being doing everything they can to destroy that industry along with our manufacturing, at a time when Canada's debt is spiraling out of control.

But from the New York Times:  """"In what the White House described as “pleasant and productive” phone calls with President Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, Mr. Trump said he would quickly start the process of renegotiating Nafta — not abandon it, as he said he would do during the 2016 presidential campaign.""""  Hello?  How come the Mexican leader got left out of the Globe and Mail's narrative?

The government is going to have to invest in education, and provide it at a reasonable cost, or perhaps even support people and provide free education to get them back into the modern working world.  Trump recently had a meeting with a couple of automakers, and they told him they couldn't fill many jobs because there weren't enough educated/trained Americans. The company I work for has a difficult time finding enough educated staff as well.  Is this what you're saying the people realize and the government doesn't?

We don't know the precise nature of his lies since he continues to withhold his tax returns. I'm convinced he's even lying about the returns being under audit: he's never produced the IRS notification of the audit. This man is forming the most corrupt government in the history of the United States, and he's doing it unapologetically, publicly, defiantly.

And where was your concern for country when Mitch McConnell stated that his number one concern after Obama was elected wasn't working on legislation good for the country, but rather making a Republican grab for power by trying to make Obama a one term president? About three years ago, the Republicans even voted down a combined Public Works infrastructure and returning veterans training bill, saying the county """"couldn't afford it"""". Where was your concern then Randy? Trump has only been in office two weeks, The Dems haven't even had a chance to vote on any Trump legislation, just some of his picks for Cabinet positions.

The majority of America elected President Trump. Look at the electoral map to confirm that.

No court can realistically address this latest EO because all of the denials are not in America but on foreign soil. So stop wasting precious Hawaiian tax money on meaningless challenges. DO HOWEVER focus on real problems like what should Shatz Hirano Gabbard and Hanabussa be doing in DC to address the N.Korean missile threat to Hawaii. That is more significant than some politician with an inflated ego attacking the president. The possible and likely death dealing attack from N. Korea is an event which should unite all in Hawaii to petition the president for help.

1,"I do sort of feel sorry for Trump supporters. These people are almost always white, rural, older, non-college-educated, and usually men. They feel lost in a world changing faster than they can comprehend, where gender roles are evolving, and where there's increasing value placed on education and *social* responsibility, rather than traditional manhood (and the jobs associated with it). Those jobs - mining, trades, factory labor - are gone. And if its one thing most economic academics agree on, it's that those jobs are *never* coming back to the US. Ever.  However, that's where my pity ends. It's not my responsibility to spoonfeed obsolete Virginia coalminers into the new economy. Adapt, or perish. Your candidate is a vile, amoral conman. He has nothing in common with you. Constant self-aggrandizement and transparent greed are not desirable qualities in a human being. If you are too foolish to see this, keep your head buried in medieval times.

0,"What do we know, that we all agree on:  The United States Intelligence Community has concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 United States elections. Their report stated, """"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Hillary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.""""  Trump himself has agreed to this set of facts.  Is it unreasonable of the Intelligence Community to determine if Trump or his team was participating in this effort?  I don't think so.  They had no need to consult with Obama.
"
0,"Trump is apparently hoping for a greatly accelerated growth rate for the U.S. econom yto make up the difference. That was the Reagan/Bush, Sr., approach in the 80s -remember 'Read my lips, no new taxes', followed by a later tax increase to try to reduce the resulting deficit. It didn't work then and it won't work now.  Unfortunately, our own Government is relying on a similar misguided hope.
"
1,"Non disclosure agreements are common.  I am all for removing it so long as ALL non disclosure agreements in ALL walks of life are also voided. As for truth and integrity, let’s have Trump produce his tax returns,eh?  You confuse an individual with CNN.  An individual, who is a paid political pundit gave information, but CNN. Honesty and integrity would be a good starting point, so try making real valid factual arguments. Pretty please? You know who else claimed fake news whenever anything else was bad?  Who else essentially delegitimized the media to rise to power?  Yeah you know who, another German just like Trump.  Your acceptance of his claims as facts despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary is sad.  When a website contains obviously partisan articles, or an article begins with an outright falsehood (to name 2 of snarky’s Links) they become unreliable. Sorry, but reporting facts you don’t like don’t make fake news.  Claiming opinion pieces are factual news is simply stupid.

0,"Your recounting is absolutely factually inaccurate. Lynch had nothing to do with it; she recused herself from the decision because of the Clinton visit to her plane and ceded the authority to Comey. Comey absolutely had authority to make the call.

The election ended it because the GOP didn't need to flog it any more due to Trump's win.

The fact this hasn't sunk in for you is astonishing. . Furthermore, Conservatives like Ben Shaprio (who hates President Trump, BTW) and Ann Coulter wanted sit-down, open-forum discussions on social policy and Berkeley Leftists and fascists rioted until it was deemed too unsafe to have such conversations. . President Trump has done many things that do not at all align with Conservative, Libertarian, or Conservative values-- to collectively call those who voted for him made-up words and act like they are all the same is the textbook definition of bigotry.

Instead they push the really important issues to the side and blame 'the other guy' for being the problem.  Its gotten so bad that we elected the least qualified candidate in modern history, on the sad hopes that a 'star' would save us.    It didn't work for Obama, it won't work for Trump.

But you seem to give Trump a pass for his partisan behavior, policies, and the obvious falsehoods that come out of his mouth. You seem to just blame and ridicule anyone who questions or is critical of Trump's policies and behavior. And given Trump's performance and behavior to date, I think there is a lot to question and criticize. Maybe, just maybe, the problem is with Trump, not so much with his critics. Criticism, just to get your name in the news, or to only score partisan political points undermines democracy. But I expect and want thoughtful, well reasoned criticism from our other officials when they think the country is going down the wrong path. That's democracy, and loyalty to country before loyalty to party or any one individual. Be that individual Trump or anyone else.

Nor will the NFL be able to do anything about these social issues that are being raised, as it's not something they are able to tackle, as the NFL is about """"entertainment of the masses"""" and leaving civil matters to the courts.  There is a right time and place for protesting, that could net better results and be less disruptive, if you just stop to think about it realistically, Ron.

Those of us who follow traditionally reliable news sources (in my cases both European, American and Canadian) would have seen enough of Mr. Trump in his own words to form our own judgements of Mr. Trump's character. And that is the essence of the problem we all have. And I agree with the potentially ominous implications of him receiving such widespread praise for  military action. And the lack of wisdom is not confined to Mr. Trump but extends as well to other prominent figures such as Senator Lindsay Graham who interprets  Assad's quickly resumed use of the attacked airfield with conventional weapons as fully justifying further attacks, based on seemingly offended pride. Whatever happened to the wisdom offered prior to the Iraq war that if you break it you own it? (with all the horrendous costs, violence, complications and consequences that implies)

Because most people do not have money.  They are barely selling the stuff they make now. And after the tax cuts, companies still will not pay any more.  Why should they?

The foolish mainstream press is falling all over itself with praise for Trump's improvisational strike on Syria and he is enough of a fool to continue coveting that sort of praise more than he is prepared to do the hard work of thinking through a coherent foreign policy. Surrounded by generals, with the nuclear codes at his disposal, and without the capacity for sequential analysis, Trump is the most dangerous national leader on the planet today. He is more dangerous than Kim Jong-Un if only because he has far more deadly force available and the means to project it anywhere on earth.

Once committed to genuinely universal healthcare (which Trump promised repeatedly throughout the campaign, lying every time he said it), we will devise policies (imperfect, for sure) to advance that principle. Every other industrial nation on earth has done it; it's preposterous to say that we can't, and truly vile to say that we shouldn't. This is a question of political will and of values.

Trump has no intention of taking away anything from women or anyone else (unless you are a terrorist or criminal) - it is all a farce, a scare tactic started by the left to make up for the fiasco they had with Bernie and Clinton. The left presented a Socialist (some thought communist) and a lying FEMALE career crook that doesn't care about the murder of gays and subjugation of women or Christians. Now all these poor 'ladies' (the ones that didn't actually listen and vote FOR Trump) feel out of touch and need to 'stand up' and show just how clueless they are. So - let them make fools of themselves and fade back into their 'safe place' the left likes to promote..

0,"Let's look at another time someone supposedly did something damaging to the campaign.  Flynn's son got booted from the campaign for tweeting about Pizzagate.  Trump knew about that and thus Flynn's son was fired.  Yet we're supposed to believe Trump didn't know about an email or meeting with not one but three of his subordinates?  I cannot find that plausible.  You are talking about a guy who was so ingrained, so involved in his campaign and now his administration yet was somehow clueless of what went on under his very nose by his own handpicked executives and son in his campaign HQ. The only time it has been claimed that Trump """"doesn't know what's going on"""" is when he let slip intelligence to Russian officials in the WH.

0,"Trump's temporary ban on immigration from six countries, and the brouhaha that erupted from it, was an illuminating issue for me. It demonstrated how even a short-term, reasoned act on the part of Trump would be spun as an act of sheer evil by his enemies, including the MSM.  Of the six countries included in Trump's temporary immigration ban, the USA is  currently making war in four of them. The other two are not what you'd call friendly to America. Are all those countries predominantly Muslim? Yes. Regardless, the security concern is glaringly obvious. And it's the US president that's specifically tasked with ensuring the security of the country.  Trump's 90-day ban on immigration from those countries, in order to conduct a close review of America's immigration policies, was eminently sensible. It was enacted within the president's mandate and of short duration only. An easy score for Trump.

Mike Flynn hoped that the US could improve all manner of relations with Russia once Trump was in office, and Putin likewise hoped that would be the case. Nobody directed anyone to do anything! These are all simply patriots doing their job, and that's why Flynn will end up working beside Oliver North on Fox news once Trump wins his second term. The end.

0,"I've seen plenty of debate over the issue after Trump announced DACA's end.  The usual line of argument is DACA is just like DAPA, which it isn't, and that DAPA was found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which it wasn't. Texas sued for a preliminary injunction of DAPA before it went into effect.  A court granted the injunction and Obama's administration appealed (injunctions are always immediately appealable).  A split court, the 5th Circuit I believe, upheld the injunction so it went to the Supreme Court, which was only at eight Justices after Scalia's death.  The Supreme Court was also split.  IIRC, the actual merits of the case never made it to trial because Trump dropped it shortly after his inauguration. I don't know if RR is unthinkingly getting his news from hyper partisan talking heads or has gone hyper partisan himself and is fabricating/revising the facts but it seems any assertion he makes should be treated with great skepticism.

Your 'grade' is merely an example of your arrogance towards anyone who fails to agree with your position(s).  I prefer to post my own thoughts as opposed to just cutting-and-pasting those of others.  The WSJ represents all those 1% Wall Street folks who bought a President and then didn't get her.  Even though they spent  millions trying to beat Trump both in the primary and the general election, they still don't have someone they can control.

0,"Contemporaneity is coincidence by definition, but it is always possible that there is some cause-and-effect relationship between contemporaneous events. A president who claims to have won his war against sexually transmitted disease, might claim that his success encouraged others to abandon caution and catch a dose of the clap. That Trump triumphed (he claims) where others failed only shows that justice is mainly sporadic, as Trump's election demonstrates. I think there is some cause-and-effect in the Congressional """"tax reform"""" and the recent market record highs; but I think those are inspired by an """"irrational exuberance"""", and expectation of soaring corporate profits. A foreseeable downside might be a soaring national debt at a time when the """"Boomers'"""" medical costs peak over the next 30 years.  As usual, in good times Republicans plunder the treasury on behalf of the wealthy, and leave it up to Democrats to clean up the mess.

Unless you have a back channel the rest of us including Martin don't have, I do not see how you can support your claim that Tillerson has and will continue to play a very marginal role.  This early it is too soon to tell how influential secretary Tillerson will be on foreign policy but there are rational grounds to expect Rex will be very influential in this sphere.  One, he is secretary of state responsible for foreign policy development and its execution by the vast network of foreign policy and diplomatic resources.  Two, he didn't rise to be CEO of the world's 5th largest company by being a passive patsy sitting back, letting others lead, and just following orders..  Three, he doesn't need the job and what for him is the laughable income and will resign if he is marginalized.

0,"Newsflash!!! Trump won the presidency and also took Alaska by a wide margin. Lisa is a moderate on many social issues but rightfully mostly loyal to her own party just as liberals are 110% loyal to democratic causes. The primary takeaway from Trumps win is that voters are sick to death of the status quo. Alaska spends more per capita then ANY state on education and the results are dismal at best. You've had your chance and then some. Time to go in a different direction. DeVos will NOT end public education but she will work to create a competitive  environment which is sorely needed. The NEA opposes her because they fear the horrific job they've done will be exposed. A system that prohibits the firing of poor teachers must go.... Just one of many changes we need.

I did not stand for it when Hillary's defense of using a personal email server was that others had done it previously. It didn't make it right, its not criminal as neither the Rs or Ds want their people to be charged for doing it. At this point I don't know if Trump is on the whole issue, but at least one member of his campaign team has plead guilty to lying to the FBI in regards to trying set up contacts with the Russians. FYI I don't belong to either party as I believe they are both full of unethical people and are self-serving organizations.

0,"When Trump is made aware of this travesty then the American widow has nothing to worry about. President Trump is in control of foreign policy, in charge of NAFTA negotiations and can ban any trade with any nation for any reason. Trump will be appropriately outraged and likely demand a 'Speer Clause' forcing Canada to pay the widow $10 Million or no NAFTA. Americans are hearing in their media that a US War Hero was murdered by a Canadian who admitted the murder and the Canadian Government is paying the Canadian killer $10 Million and is apologizing as well. This is going to be a self-inflicted disaster for Canada as Canada didn't have to pay. To announce this on one of the most sacred US holidays for US military members , July 4th, is especially insulting.
"
0,"One will remember how many times Trump seriously suggested that someone should shoot Clinton if she became President so as to prevent any changes to the right to carry weapons. He never apologized when it was pointed out to him that he was inciting the murder of a President of the United States. Griffin is a comedian, no-one took her seriously.

0,"Somewhere, somehow – immigration to the U.S. or Canada has morphed from a privilege to a right. Slowly those from foreign lands have infiltrated our countries, legally and illegally to the point where their voices and their needs trump our own. We have become the outsiders. My grandfather arrived on Ellis Island in April, 1900. He was told to change his name, learn English, become a productive member of and integrate into U.S. culture. He married, had two daughters one my mother, and worked as a porter in a NYC high rise. He never ONCE complained or protested. Does that sound like the immigrant of today? Dramatically call it “hate” if you wish, I couldn’t care less.  Unorthodox as Trump may be, he’s correct. You either have borders or you don’t.

He's supposed to execute the laws Congress writes, not make up laws to suit himself.  I totally oppose executive orders no matter who is doing them, but at the present time, it is the only way to unwind Obama's executive orders, which were no more legitimate than Trump's.  At some point, probably sooner than later, we the people are going to have to call an Article 5 convention to propose Constitutional amendments and deal with the nonsense of executive orders. It undermines the checks and balances of government and the foundation of the Constitution.

I include the '60's because America still needs to integrate the poor and powerless into the culture.

Pulitzer prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh reported after a 2014 chemical weapons attack in Syria that British and American intelligence analysts had uncovered evidence that the Sarin was likely not released by the Assad government and there were indications that Turkey’s intelligence services may have collaborated with radical rebels to deploy the Sarin as a false-flag operation. Trump, nor anyone else, can definitively say so quickly after this recent attack that it was orchestrated by Assad. Let's not forget, this is a President who brags that he doesn't read books and doesn't like reading reports. As he says, """"I just know.""""

Your country as you and parents have known it will cease to exist in the same form.  You will be peasants and peons who will be forced to play second fiddle to China and Mexico.  Your income will continue to decrease as your earning power is re-directed to other lands and peoples who you will never see or know.

Are you referring to the Clinton Foundation and their work? Believe me, as someone who has worked in international development for many years, the Clinton foundation has a horrific reputation on the ground, and I don't know anyone (most of whom are super liberal so this is not a partisan concern) who would work for them. And her corruption is so out in the open now - you really can't deny it. I get the concern over Trump, but for myself the concern is equally there as relates to Clinton. I'm flabbergasted when people believe the allegations against her are because she is a woman. There is way too much proof to view this as some sort of misogynistic conspiracy.

0,"I'm starting to wonder if Trump's own people are trying to sabotage him.  Whoever fed him the breitbart article with this claim must have known that was was going to react to it.  By tweeting what he did, he opened himself up to being caught in a lie in a very public and high profile way.  If they don't find any evidence of any Obama-ordered wiretap (and they probably won't), that is the best-case scenario.  The worst-case scenario is that the investigation forces the wiretaps and anything incriminating on them into discovery.  Stay tuned...

We're a part of the U.S.  Assistance in a catastrophe should be given to our state as much as has been given to Florida or Texas - or any other state.  We pay our share of federal taxes, don't we?

0,"So, you know all these details how?  If you think the media ever gets a full accounting of the """"intelligence gain"""" from any action, you should reconsider.  A president can certainly review a military plan, but to think that any president will have a meaningful input on the planning and logistics for an operation is quite wishful.  Do you expect him to ask why a particular helicopter was chosen? He needs to hear an honest assessment of the risk and potential gain, and to decide if the risk will likely be worth the potential gain. That's about all he can do other than make preparations for any political ramifications of the action. Military actions will always have risk, otherwise we wouldn't need the military to conduct the operation.  Trump, like any president, of course gets the responsibility for ops he approves (and those he delays or denies as well).  Just don't assume that the whole story in any way resembles what you see in the papers.

He is rude, insulting, a liar (exaggerator at best), self centered, is OK with nepotism and appointing cronies,   is vindictive and will punish those who disagree.    Your constant flow of crass insults only gets you to class A ball in comparison to the pro's like Trump.   Take that as a compliment.  Trump has 3.5 years to show progress in his goals, whatever they may be, to overcome his rough start.   That should be plenty of time to establish himself if he has any talent for the job.

Just regurgitate another story about Trump and the Russians.  As long as most of them do it, the readers buy it and validate the practice.  With the Trump-Russia matter we are literally seeing the failure of democracy.  The failure of the media role to provide useful information.  The story is without evidential basis yet it will not go away.  Eventually, the story becomes reality especially when it serves the needs of the democrats who are sore losers.

At no time has Khan ever even mildly criticized rabid Islamic radicals or those who practice Sharia Law.  Khan's policy is one of reaction, not a pro-active approach which would close radical mosques, deport extremists, strip the passports from those who fight for Daesh, and clearly state that those who practice Sharia Law will not be allowed entry to Britain.  Trump's policy, by contrast, is pro-active,  but it verges on a counter-productive intolerance which will understandably alienate moderate Muslims as well as all reasonable persons of other beliefs.  What must be done is separate the wheat from the chaff: the terrorist Muslims from the good Muslims.  Neither Khan's complacency nor Trump's perceived intolerance is good policy.  What's called for is a realistic prevention of Islamic terrorism.

The GOP secretly despise him but most are too cowardly to confront him. Bannon will likely disown him once tRump stops being the useful idiot that he is and when that happens, his days are surely numbered. Hell I doubt his own children actually like him.

0,"That's just not accurate. If anything, Comey's statements vindicate Trump. Comey confirmed that he repeatedly told Trump that Trump himself was not under investigation. Comey also confirmed in his statement that he understood Trump's request was to drop the investigation into Flynn's transgressions, not the broader investigation of Russia's possible ties to the campaign. He has said he was never pressured to discontinue the Russia probe. What was meant by """"loyalty"""" or """"honest loyalty"""" is ambiguous in the context of that conversation - certainly no smoking gun there. The President was well within his authority to fire James Comey and it has not been shown that the reason for the firing was anything other than what the President gave. Also, Trump could have asserted executive privilege and blocked Comey's testimony, but he chose not to. If Trump had anything to hide why would he have allowed Comey to testify?

A normal President who won the election but lost the vote might be a bit conciliatory, but this one is on a rampage. Trump supporters will pay the price too. For instance, a lot of them are on the ACA, which he just trashed by executive order, with no replacement in sight. If you look at current bills, you'll also see that Congress is quietly gutting consumer protections, and funneling a lot of money back to big banks.

(through the russians and comey)  When he accused the media of lying, it was his own awareness of lying his face off that got put onto everyone else.  He seemingly can't help projecting constantly, even when it would be easier not to. The man needs a lot of psychiatric help, but first he needs to get booted out of the office he scammed himself into.

He's knocked them all back on their heels. No one can dismiss his threats or an invitation to speak.  He knows when to walk away from the table. He's prepared to use the muscle and might of the best country in the world to protect the world and stop the slide into the abyss caused by dithering fools at the UN and the appeasement sheep who believe you can come to terms with a madman just by talking nice.  Think Hitler.  Think hard.  Cause that's where this is headed, but with nuclear devastation, not tanks on the boulevard.  Thank goodness for Donald Trump.

If I had committed even a tiny fraction of what the FBI documented, I would be in prison.  Second, Trump's words never described actually doing any of the things mentioned, though some in the media want you to think he did. Add that Clinton supporters have been paying women to make accusations against him when some of them made contradictory statements in the past so they cannot be believed. Instead of defending truth, what we have is a propaganda machine spewing lies to cover up for the worst political corruption in American history.

He claims that the local economy in Lane County has been """"recovered"""" for six years, despite the fact that even today, there are not as many jobs in Lane County as there were back in 2007.  And the unemployment rate is not at all a good indicator.   Our population has grown substantially in the last 9 years.   The percentage of working age adults that are working now is dramatically lower.    And when one factors that many of the new jobs that have replaced old ones have been either lower in pay, or even just part time jobs that pay no benefits, the situation is actually much bleaker still.  If the economy had truly been in great shape in recent years, Donald Trump would never have been elected President.  No doubt, though, that if the economy does falter, the media will place all blame on Donald Trump.

Where are these stories of how blacks in the NFL made it. Why aren't black players going into inter-city black communities to sharing their story? The answer is, it doesn't fit the template. Most of the stories are of young black men, making it despite the government. Being more than they can be, working, committing to a dream, or a goal.

With more Supreme Court justices appointed by a sane Democratic President, the Heller decision will be overturned soon.

0,"Hollywood, and Meryl Streep in particular doesn't understand that one of the key reasons many people voted for Trump is that he was able to channel their anger towards elites who look down on them.  Streep doesn't even realize that without even trying, she managed to insult people who like football and mixed martial arts and that this speech can be replayed to remind the voters in the flyover country to come out again in 2018 and 2020.  In a nutshell.  Trump said : """"Vote for me and I will make the elites in media and Hollywood miserable"""". And all these people in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio came out to make him POTUS.  Trump uses the press and Hollywood very successfully.  Streep is playing right into his hands and just gave him more ammunition to show his voters how much Hollywood looks down on them.

Can you put your answer in terms of human behavior, not political leaning?  And I'd ask conservatives on site to try to understand why liberals are 'soft headed' or impractical in making decision on how best to spend tax payer money? ======== IMO, Americans have to find reasons to like and trust eachother.    We need to focus on our strengths, not just our weaknesses.  Can we find the root emotional drivers of  others behavior, and see those same emotions inside our own lives?'  If we can do this, we can  stand on common human ground and lower our hostility toward our neighbors.  Nothing new being offered by me.    If my wording is awkward, readers can just go back to 'treating your neighbor as you would like to be treated',, or understanding your neighbor as you would like to be understood.

Among Hispanic Catholics, Clinton cleaned up handily, winning by more than 50 points.  Trump earned the support of Catholic voters in the Northeast and Midwest, while the two candidates split Catholics in the South. Clinton beat out Trump among Catholics in the West, 64 percent to 25 percent  Trump fared well among white Catholics, who backed him nationwide 56 percent to 37 percent.

The complaint from those finding ACA more expensive is due to their being under insured to begin with.  ACA was  oriented to adequate/full coverage.  What all of us are finding and many of us have found is that health insurance is no longer adequate...we now need supplementary insurance...what were the obstacles all along;  the republicans.  Needs of health care sought;  pre-existent coverage, young people signing on, lowering hospital/drug costs, single payer system or at least a public option.  Have you ever heard of a senior not liking Medicare...now medicare is no longer full coverage...and republicans are obstacles to all of that too.

0,"Where in the Constitution (the source of any relevant """"law and order"""" on this issue) does it state that the CIC cannot warn a potential threat (however ineloquently) that the US will respond militarily -if attacked-? His comment didn't come out of the blue, he was responding to repeated and escalating threats by North Korea. You'll note General Mattis, who does speak with clarity and sobriety, said much the same thing in his own way. Congress' power to declare war does not subsume nor supercede the authority of the President to respond to attack, nor to speak about doing so.  It would help the quality of our political discussions if those who hate Trump could restrain their emotional responses and instead think and speak rationally. Would have helped for the past 3 Presidencies, in fact.

To use terms familiar with the P.C. crowd look for trigger words and other micro-aggressive signals in the article.  What Trump said about women is unacceptable.  If he engaged in the type of behavior he spoke of in the video - that is reprehensible.  However, his opponent in the upcoming election is a a sociopathic liar who routinely sold herself to the highest bidder when she was Secretary of State.  And, she has conveniently overlooked the well-documented sexual deprivations of her husband.  I don't know what we will have in Trump as POTUS.  But, I know exactly what we will have in HRC as president and it's a lot worse than Trump will bring.

I have heard no pundits or experts speak of this very real scenario so we should all be prepared for unwanted results come the day after the election if masses of people vote third party. If you vote third party your vote might actually benefit someone you really don't want in office. And no one has any idea how many voters will not be voting R or D.

If someone from another planet were to observe these proceedings, they would be incredulous about this frantic search for something - anything - with which to negate an election, while ignoring clear, unambiguous felonies by officials at the highest levels in the previous administration.

0,"Hello Doug!  The difference between reporting on Vancouver real estate and on Donald Trump, is this.  It is both widely known, and the press reports it as such, and layperson posts largely reflect it as such, that Trump writes frequent petty tweets and that he and his family are still enmeshed in family business ventures raising conflict of interest concerns. In other words, the press reporting reflects reality.  Not so with Vancouver real estate. With it, the actual underlying phenomenon (overseas money skyrocketing prices over many years, in the hands of people from there who recently bought Canadian passports, not to be confused with """"foreign buyers"""" who relatively are a tiny force) is RARELY or NEVER reported in many Canadian media outlets, and thus we have many post writers who claim that it is merely racism that drives talk of overseas money.  On Vancouver, there is an ONGOING disconnect between reality and reporting. And so I correct the latter in my posts.

In fact, he has continued to use chlorine gas which is one of the components of the current atrocity, along with sarin. You seem to be getting your intelligence from the Russians who are clearly siding with Assad. We can't consider their intelligence as unbiased. Neither is American intelligence unbiased either, so we  have to use our knowledge of the actors involved and their past deeds.

The fact is that there have been a number of terrorist attacks affiliated with Islamic extremism on the U.S. since 2001 and Trump is determined in bringing this to a stop.  Terrorists have been able to get into the U.S. through the refugee/visa programs. Trump said he was going to do this and now it is being enacted.   Historically, there have numerous people caught up in these conditions. This is what happens in countries at risk of threat. Democracy has been strengthened fighting forces threatening it.   Watch for other countries implementing similar measures.

By now, even he has repudiated birtherism. Anyone who still defends birtherism is a racist. Trump is the most corrupt, incompetent and unstable president in history. That's no longer even a controversial statement. Conservatives and Republicans are at least as likely as liberals and Democrats to recognize that the man is not fit for the office he holds.

It's too bad that Al lives in a state of denial.  But slavery in 1861 was entirely legal in most states and all of the territories, per Dred Scott, the Constitution, and settled law.  Lincoln and his accomplices chose to abridge this legal right originally by stating that slavery would be restricted just to the South.  A rough analogy to Lincoln's scofflaw disaster would be if Trump and the pro-lifers stated that the Roe decision was not applicable and that abortion would be banned.  You can imagine what the reaction of feminists and progressives would be.  Killing innocent, defenseless babies is worse than slavery, but the law is the law; if it isn't respected, then the consequences can be horrible.

Someday, maybe, if you on the left allow thoughts into your heads from places other then propaganda, someday you will realize you have been being used, and on that day, after your tears, you also will say enough with the political corruption we have all seen for far to long.

Probably not as long as Trump is in power. He doesn't want these migrants reentering his country. Uncontrolled border jumping from the U.S. will be Canada's problem to solve.

But they wanted right-wing Cruz even less.  And all the mainstream moderates had cancelled themselves out by then.  At that point voters had no choice for the nomination, although many were still hoping for some way to replace Trump as the nominee.

0,"Both of your statements, unfortunately, are completely false. Unemployment coming out of the brief six-month recession of 1980 was steadily falling. The Reagan recession was a separate thing, a year later, and lasted 16 months, during which time the decline in the unemployment rate reversed, and jobless rate peaked at 10.8 percent. It took Reagan until mid-1984 to bring unemployment down to the rate that Jimmy Carter handed him.  The labor force participation rate is a fairly meaningless number but here again, you state a falsehood. The rate was nowhere near """"historic lows"""" during the Obama administration. Obama handed Trump a rate that was just 2.8 percentage points less than what Bush handed Obama eight years earlier, at 62.9 percent. The historic high for the LPR came under the Clinton Administration at 67.3 percent. The historic low for the LPR came during the height of America's economic expansion in the 1950s, at 58.1 percent in 1954, showing how meaningless the statistic is.

There is a widespread visceral hate for the man, which I can understand.  However, this hatred is too often translated into criticism and intolerance for anyone who doesn't denounce him as strongly as they do.  And that, my colleague in commentary, is problematic.  It's turning every issue on which he speaks into a referendum on Trump which hijacks the original issue.

0,"In the US system, the president has the authority to fill over 4700 positions.  As a president who campaigned on the GOP ticket and as a conservative, he will appoint a considerable number of conservatives.  But unlike here where the PM is constrained by having to choose from a small number of MPs and having to give consideration to racial and regional representations and now, stupidly, having to also choose 50% women and 50% men, the US president can actually choose from the best qualified people to fill specific cabinet - and other -roles regardless of their ideology.  On Sunday, in front of millions of viewers of 60 Minutes, the Trump children were asked if they would serve in their father's administration.  They all said no, they would concentrate on running the Trump business empire.  Sorry if conservative appointments offend you and Judith M. so but this is what voters in THE ELECTION (as opposed to the liberal mob rule in the streets) voted for.  Remain calm.

0,"There is absolutely no question regarding the Constitutional First Amendment protection regarding the burning of the American flag.  Mr. Trump's comments provide some more """"red meat"""" for his supporters, but they have no foundation in law.  In fact, historically the method for disposing of a """"desecrated"""" or, perhaps, just warn out, American flag is to burn it in private.  So, clearly the """"burning"""" is not in question.  The real issue is burning the flag as a protest against actions by the American government...and, that, is clearly established as a protected exercise of freedom of expression.  If Mr. Trump would like to propose a Constitutional Amendment to exempt """"flag burning"""" from the """"First Amendment Rights"""", he is, of course, free to do so.

The only people that tax complexity helps are IRS (CRA) employees and tax consultants. But do you trust the Trump administration to make this revenue neutral?  Lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% sounds good but for what purpose? The US economy is running at full tilt. It doesn't need stimulus. The issue is with inequality. Do we believe that companies would give their employees raises if their profits go up or would they pay a dividend to shareholders or expand overseas? It would seem there are more effective ways to spend a couple of trillion dollars.  I know! How about universal health care. It would have an immediate impact on most American's pocketbook and a great start to reducing income disparity. It would also reduce the cost of American labour for companies so they could compete.

He would recast them as noble heroes—venerated by Washington think tanks, deluged with money from Congress.  Playing tennis with Yanukovych at Mezhyhirya was the culmination of Manafortvich’s long career.

0,"Mr. Krauthammer,  Like many within your community, sir, I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of Mr. Trump's approach. There are  points I want to address.  First, you mention Truman in Korea as acting with US interests placed first. I think that is not reflective of the entire truth. Stemming from Bretton Woods, where America replaced the British Empire, it was the duty of the United States to ensure global stability so that controls put in place to prevent the rise of the pre-WW1 situation never again arose. Containment was reflective of this approach. Korea might be the pinnacle example of Containment. Thus, Korea's objective was global stability with American interest being subordinate to it.  Similarly, Obama's policies also subordinate American interest to a broader global demand or agenda. Mr. Trump rejects the need, accepting a Waltzian view if international relations.  Secondly, its pretty easy to see Trump seeks strategic consistency and tactical unpredictability.

0,"I read it, since I subscribe to WSJ. I thought the column was full of speculation based on speculation based on speculation, all based on Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton on an airport runway. Yet again, a right-wing commentator seeing a deep plot and suppression of evidence that Hillary did something illegal. The FBI, including its many conservative Republican agents, reviewed it and found nothing criminal. Ms. Strassel's column is a sop to right-wing conspiracy freaks, and a justification for the firing of Comey, which was  almost certainly done to impede the Trump-Russia investigation. Look for more cuts to the FBI, more firings, and the transfer of top investigators to district offices in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and American Samoa.

0,"Paul,  Your mixing up issues to justify something you want.  The NATO alliance requires 2% GDP from each country for that nation to arm, defend, and if necessary, deploy and sustain its forces in a war zone for an indefinite time.  If a nation in the alliance, cannot do this, they are less than mission capable and a drain on other nation's capabilities.  Which means if we want them in the fight, the US and other nations then have to drain our resources to pay for them to be there, and usually as I saw in Afghanistan and Iraq, they do little or no fighting.  This means our military expenditures have to go up which gets at the military industrial complex you write about.  But what Trump is pointing out in his own inarticulate way is nation X gets to spend their portion of defense spending on social programs instead.  Wouldn't you rather have nation's X military budget go up so ours can go down?  We are and have been the """"mark"""" in this game for decades.

For years, these Hostages (let's call them what they really are) languished in Iranian prisons with NO intervention on obama's part.  Then suddenly, they're released.  obama would have liked to claim it was HIS Nuclear Deal that won their freedom.  What most of the media failed to point out was that we paid Iran $400 MILLION for their release.  I know a RANSOM when I see a RANSOM, regardless of what the obama administration would have you believe.  Good going, obama.

0,"There is a lot of truth to this argument, but I also think that too many analysts are jumping on this explanation without enough analysis of the data. As Saunders has pointed out, the median income of a Trump voter was $72,000. This is not a person who was hurting financially. In both Brexit and in the case of the US, there is a clear and important racial component at work. The Tea Party supporters were also quite wealthy, but their major problem was they could not stand having an African American President. Remember that 90% of the people who voted for Trump were white. There were plenty of non-white people who suffered from the housing crisis and its aftermath. They did not vote for Trump. Many of them did not vote at all. This underlines the extent to which this vote had race at its heart. We ignore this at our peril.

While it's true that Trump is a pathological liar, I think he has very good reasons for lying about Russia and for requiring everyone around him to lies about it. Clearly Putin owns him; Trump defers to Putin, appeases him, shows every sign that he's scared to death of him; I'm sure that's not without reason. I did find an article in a right wing source that asserts that Chomsky is not much concerned about """"collusion""""; I couldn't find an original or a collaborating source.

Individually most developed, Western countries cannot deal with Russia but combined NATO has 20 times the conventional forces they do. Russia wants the Western world to be in chaos so we're isolated and easily addressed individually.  There's no easy solution here but until impeachment proceedings are in place for Trump we need to radically alter our foreign policy and trade policy. We should be pro-active, not reactive. Sitting idly by hoping that this won't come to pass, that the US House or Senate will save us is not a solution.

So careless that if anyone other than Hillary were to do the same, they would find themselves charged, convicted and doing a rather large amount of time in prison. I would be just as concerned about a republican doing the same things. Most republicans were actively supporting impeachment of Nixon. Republicans supported Gingrich resigning until it was found that he did nothing illegal or wrong. I have a very large problem with anyone who lies about anything and everything, over and over and do not care what party they are from, Trump included. I know that most politicians lie about a whole lot but Hillary takes lying to a whole new level. The thing that completely tears it for me, after spending 15 years working in Naval Intelligence, is the arrogant misuse of classified information.

This was the reason as to why Donald Trump and republicans were given the DC trifecta they now enjoy. Americans who once enjoyed the plethora of insurance options they previously had, unlike Europeans, are still living and remember what it was like before the premium increases and when they were able to choose their own doctors and surgeons. They will not allow republicans to forget this in 2018.

Talk about LaLa Land. There is not enough remaining in the Federal budget  for other Departments to cover all of this. In any case many other Government agencies which would have to have their budgets badly slashed are at least as important to the security of American citizens as is the military, e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, The National Institutes of Health, the Center for Disease Controls, The Department of Agriculture, The Transportation Safety Agencv, etc.

We only need to fix the individual exchange markets. And there are good ideas for fixing these-- hold some hearings, invite some of the insurers who have proposed fixes, include Democrats in the process, make the changes, then pass the bill under a new name so it is not called Obamacare (do not call it Trumpcare either).

His aggressive manner exposed all the other candidates for the yes-men/woman they were. Now that the Trump is coming back up into the mouths of conservatives, some have pronounced it delicious. Others, like Paul Jenkins, have noted a """"nutty"""" flavor...but anything is better than Hillary.

0,"In the US Presidential election, popular vote has never been what determines the final outcome.  When the founding fathers drafted the US constitution, they felt it was necessary to protect the rights of the smaller and less populous states.  Hence, in picking the president, the smaller states have a little bit more weight in the Electoral College.  It's part of the system of checks and balances built into the United States system.  Though usually the candidate with more popular support does tend to do better in the Electoral College as well.  But that doesn't always happen.  Perhaps Hillary Clinton would have done better in swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan if she spent more time campaigning there.  Instead, she assumed these traditionally Democrat strongholds would just vote Democrat.  Trump and his supporters decided to put more effort into these states, and the effort paid off.

0,"On the campaign trail, politicians say anything, literally anything, that will garner votes. Trump is no exception and neither is Hillary. Hyperbole, stretching the truth, taking out of context, and outright lying are daily occurrences. Somehow, we have gotten to the point where any candidate who does not do this will lose. That is on the voters as much as it is on the candidates.  But while serving in public office, this behavior is intolerable. Hillary Clinton has made a career of it for 25 years or more. Trump may do the same, but we don't know yet. But Hillary, we are certain of her character while in office, and it is offensive. Mr. Dionne and other Hillary supporters ignore this behavior, or even excuse it. That is also offensive, because he is a member of the press.  Neither Trump nor Hillary are Christians according to their fruits. But Trump is correct about at least one thing: our leaders ARE selling Christianity down the tubes. But it is not Trump doing it. It is the left.

He's spineless whether he fails to denounce Trump because Sullivan either tacitly agrees with Trump, as I suspect, or he's too weak to denounce what he should clearly recognize as wrong, falling in step with the worst aspects of his party.

According to Article II, Section 2, Clause I of the Constitution, the President of the United States is “Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.”[56] Since the National Security Act of 1947, this has been understood to mean all United States Armed Forces.  Trump is NOT my Commander-in-Chief nor is he yours (or anyone else's) UNLESS you are currently serving.  Again, he is Commander-in-Chief of the military only.  This is basic civics.  And yes, for the record, I served in the military.

"

That's $400th for the most powerful and important job on the planet, which to me seems a bit low.  It reminds me of police in the third world who survive on """"tips"""".  Anyway, $400th is next to nothing to a billionaire president.  It's even closer to nothing if the president doesn't reveal his holdings and meets regularly with the people who manage his investments.  Closer to nothing, still, if he inexplicably threatens or supports publicly traded companies on a regular basis.

"
0,"It appears that Trump's """"Buy American, Hire American"""" look good only as a PR gimmick. That's because companies appear to have the ability to bypass Trump's """"Hire American"""" executive order by offering wages much lower than the market. This allows companies to fill up positions with foreign workers thru immigration visas. For example, a prevailing market based minimum wage is $13.25.  By offering a minimum wage of $10.45 no American would even touch a job that pay much lower than market wage of $13.25. Result? No American would even touch such a lower paying job, which therefore gives a company justification to hire foreign workers willing to accept the much lower wage. * What the """"Hire American"""" executive order should have covered was specify that companies can only offer wages that are market based to enable Americans to accept the job offers. Offering jobs with wages below market should be justification to reject visa requests for foreign workers and close the loophole.

The Dow Jones was rated a """"Dog""""; other experts were saying the post-election Trump Pump was over and a fall was inevitable.  Speculation was that oil could slip back to the high $30's, and the prognosis was the the Canadian market was overdue for a big boost after having sat in the doldrums for a few months and falling further behind the American markets.  This weekend, the Dow Jones is rated as a """"Star"""" after having set an all-time record high.  The price of oil is just under $50.  The Canadian market is still underwater for the year, and here we are with another expert claiming it's ready to take off.  Good thing they don't write in the Sports section.  They'd be projecting a major run by the Blue Jays given how poorly they played so far this season.

Well, trade only constitutes 10% of the massive U.S. economy, so the disruption may not be as disruptive in the U.S. as many assume. And Trump is largely correct that """"free trade"""" is no such thing. Various countries employ different mechanisms to suppress market forces in order to gain and maintain """"competitive"""" advantage, from China's export subsidies, lack of labour rights and currency policies to the suppression and manipulation of labour unions in Mexico.

It is up to Congress to make the law and it is now in their hands to give the president a law that he can enforce.  If not, then the illegals need to follow the law and re-enter the U.S. as any other legal immigrant needs to do.

It seems to me that the lower the polls go for president Trump, the better it is for the republican agenda, unless of course they (republicans) go too far.  But with republican and democratic gerrymanded districts, I just don't see that happening.  The democrats/progressives/socialists/social-democrats have shot their wads with mass protests.

Quite the contrary moving toward net neutrality is a very GOOD idea that provides a level playing field and opens doors to innovation.

The Repubs are docs and business owners, more likely to support reform, but both dems and repubs focus on re-election as their first priority. All the established politicians can't stand Trump because he's upsetting their """"gig"""". Trump's policies are better for Hawaii than anything offered in the last decade. Like Washington , DC, politicians in Hawaii have great jobs representing a one party State. If you have kids in Hawaii, encourage them to become politicians, not doctors or engineers.

0,"Of course I never said Trump sympathizes with the Klan, etc. (borrowing a page from utilitas's book?). I said Trump sympathized with the """"very fine people"""" who marched with Nazis and Klansman. This is well established, as is the outcry that ensued. The question arises: how can one be a """"very fine person"""" and consort with Nazis and Klansmen?  You can't be this credulous. I'm well aware of Trump's past statements, but pandering to the most reactionary and retrograde elements on the right helped get him elected, and now he is all about the base. Trump appears to be descending into some kind of dementia. His politics revolve around the cult leader: himself.  I've had enough of your bs. Good day.

0,"Whether or not it was illegal for Trump to ask Comey to back off his investigation into Mike Flynn, it was completely inappropriate. What shows is a persistent effort by Trump to interfere with the legal system. Trump has attacked the institutions of American government that he sees as impediments. He denounced judges and the courts. He has attacked journalists as “the enemy of the people.” He has raged at Democrats and Republicans who stand up to him. And perhaps most fundamentally, lying is his default mode of communication. The frightening thing is that many Americans don't know or care.

Trump's mindless comments, and usual bullying (they all should be fired) isn't how a leader acts to unite people. He instead exacerbated the situation as usual by opening his big mouth, leading to more players joining the protests. If he'd shut up, doubtful it would have gotten to this point.  And your comment that BLM, a peaceful protest, started racism is too ridiculous to deserve response, but definitely spoken by a racist.

Trump, the Republicans in congress and the rest of the rich pigs at the trough have no clue what to replace it with so they are trying to figure out how to keep it and modify it D.

The accusations that the Russians influenced the US election is pure politics, played by the Obama administration.  We may take it as a given that there's cyber intrusions into the networks of political parties in every country of interest. The IT infrastructures of political parties are likely to be much easier to penetrate than government networks. But at the same time a great deal of valuable information can be obtained. In all likelihood those intrusions come from both foreign and domestic sources.  Now to the point: the public report issued by the FBI and Homeland security identified two breaches of the Democrats IT network. The report does not say what, if anything, was obtained in those breaches. The FBI and HS do not say that the election was influenced by that breach. That claim is made by the Obama administration, only.

The headline in this article is saying no wiretapping evidence exists and yet they reported 24x7 about all these intercepted communications just one month ago!  And today we saw leaks of conservations between Trump and some of his aids picks – nothing to do with Russia. So clearly under the Obama administration the intelligence community been intercepting communications – and it been widely reported. So it not like there is ZERO evidence here! Cleary wiretapping was occurring and now we see it was not limited to Russia. This is Watergate II.  As for being directed by Obama? That we don’t know at all and only some whistle blower would confirm that as no one is that silly to leave a paper trail.  At least let’s get the story right about all kinds of wiretapping that has been going on. The idea that no evidence exists in this regards is beyond silly.

When they look at it, do they see millions of lives cut short, enough to justify a massive travel ban? It is unclear. What is clear is that they exist in a universe where no one reported adequately on the Paris attacks, whereas we live in a universe where all 130 victims were profiled. This discrepancy is nobody’s fault. There, the media really did cover up dozens of very serious attacks in which I, personally, was killed. ... Both of these universes are equally valid. We happen to live in one where none of these things are true, and they happen to live in one where all of these things are true, but that does not mean that we are right and they are wrong.

At this point, Trump needs to be really careful who he fires, because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find anybody to step in to replace them.

The record shows that Walker hired people in his very own office at higher salaries than  people being let go. Olympian Pitney was hired at $20,000+ more than her predecessor. His presser, Grace Jang, was hired at a higher salary than her predecessor - just after she finished her stint as the reporter and the primary driver of the disgraced National Guard story for KTUU.  The new leg director was brought in at a higher salary than his predecessor...  Walker continues to spout his spread-the-pain mantra.

That is why you don't give in and give up.  You do that, you die.  Look at the world.  Trump understands that.  It says that somewhere in the Bible as well.  Those people in those times understood all of that.  So did God.  That is what it is.  For a long time we escaped it because we are protected by the oceans.  We were lucky. Now it is here.

0,"What is it going to take for the Denver Post to acknowledge the growing violence of the antifa movement, which uses mob violence to prevent speech they disagree with?  For months these people have been showing up at Trump rallies, conservative speeches and other events they disagree with  using intimidation and violence to disrupt and sometimes cancel these events.  In Washington state they blocked I-5 north of Seattle for hours, causing a major traffic jam, and ultimately a fatal accident where a person died because the roads were blocked to emergency personnel.  Yesterday they met and destroyed a statue they didn't like.  This is literally fascism in action and goes against the principles of tolerance and 1st amendment free speech rights.  This behavior needs to be condemned and nipped in the bud before it tears the country apart.  Those responsible for organizing and financing it should be found and prosecuted and held responsible for the personal injuries and property damage.

Even on the issue of abortion he's gone back and forth through time enough for anyone to know that he's pandering for votes on the issue.  Hillary isn't perfect either.  She's a better example than Trump in every way when it comes to religious principals. She's a life long Methodist with a history of policies to help families.

There's no margin of error in sailing these enormous vessels.

0,"'  Trump has an enormous conflict of interest on his hands with Deutsche Bank.  As Trump himself noted in his 2008 lawsuit against the bank, Deutsche played a prominent role in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.  The Obama administration has targeted Deutsche Bank and other banks for creating and repackaging bad mortgage products, and earlier this fall the Justice Department announced it was seeking to settle claims against the bank for about $14 billion.  That was much more than Deutsche Bank was expecting to pay, and the news sent the bank into a tailspin. Its stock price plummeted amid speculation that it could not remain afloat if the Justice Department pressed the bank for such a big settlement.  Negotiations between the bank and the Justice Department over the size of the settlement are underway.  But if they are not resolved by January 20, Trump’s administration will be in charge of handling this case. .

I can tell you that Trump has far exceeded my expectations. His work ethic is amazing. His meetings with so many groups (auto makers, unions, high tech companies, etc...), all of whom have stated that these have been the most productive meetings they've ever had at the White House, are impressive. The moral suasion he is using on CEOs is already having a positive effect on employment. The policy signals he is sending has the stock markets (which are a forward-looking mechanism) loves what it sees. I guess besides all this, it's been a """"rocky start"""", heehee.

Difference would be that the single-payer would have the bargaining power to control prices.

I would have thought that Trump running a multi-billion dollar business empire with over 500 business units in dozens of countries employing tens of thousands of people would constitute sufficient executive experience to pick and direct a strong team team of advisers, cabinet and sub-cabinet executives.  But I guess you differ.  How large and successful an organization is needed  to meet your standard regarding qualifications to be president?  How would you compare PM Justin Trudeau's executive experience to lead the executive branch of a G 7 nation with that of POTUS Trump?

Their complete failure to act, the legislative incompetence and purposeless grandstanding(especially in the Senate) will make the next couple of cycles of the Congressional elections very interesting, especially since the Democrats are not much of an alternative.

It is pretty delusional reasoning to attempt to compare political puffery and stretching of facts to Trump's outright denial of reality.

He says one thing, then contradicts himself, then denies it, then does something else, all the while complaining that the Press is putting out fake news against him. CNN today is talking about the commission Trump established on his claim of massive voter fraud to deny him the moral victory of the popular vote, even though he won the electoral college.  Meanwhile, Trump's negotiating tactic seems to be to bully people. Kim knows that if he has ICBMs and nukes, he can stand up to this bully.

0,"I thought the Petrodollar was why we protected Saudi Arabia.  When Nixon took us off the gold standard he sent Kissinger to Saudi Arabia and cut a deal.  If Saudi Arabia would accept only dollars for oil and invest the excess dollars in US securities we would provide military protection and keep Israel from attacking them.  The deal was made and soon all OPEC did the same.  Thus the dollar remained strong.  All countries had to convert their currency to dollars in order to buy oil from OPEC.  Today 60 percent of our dollars are in overseas accounts and the dollar is the leading world reserve currency, so we are told.  Otherwise our fiat monetary system could collapse sooner than later.  After all, $19 trillion dollars of debt is the most debt any nation has incurred, ever!  Only faith in the dollar keeps it from collapsing now.  I think Trump might be biting off more than he can chew.

But I have never seen a President subjected to so much personal hate, not even Bush.  People accuse him of nonsense like """"race baiting"""" (whatever that is -- as if a Black President shouldn't talk about race!) and blame him for a greater racial divide; one crackpot below claims he's responsible for the thugs who committed a hate crime against a man in Chicago.

I'm sure that if Stalin and his Communist party were still alive, they'd have voted for Clinton over Trump.  Does that mean Clinton would have been in a """"coalition"""" with STalin and his comrades?  Ridiculous.  Whether by intent or by carelessness, you simply don't use the word """"coalition"""" correctly.  It has its costs in credibility.  Look, I agree that Trump was awful, and for many reasons.

If Trump Jr can be shown to have offered any consideration in return for publication of the hacked emails that's criminal conspiracy. The Foreign Election Campaign Act, and the Foreign Agents Registration Act might both cover such acts. Should I keep going?

The relationships of people to be allowed to enter the US is still not perfectly clear, but that does not matter. What matters is those wanting to enter proving the relationships.  How will that be done? We simply cannot take their words that they are related to someone in the US, and records to prove relationships may not exist in the six countries mentioned in the ban.  I believe most people wanting to enter will not be able to positively establish the relationships and will not be allowed in.  By the time AG Chin realizes this is happening, the Supreme Court most likely will have rule in Trump’s favor.

It features a powerful speaker making a speech, and somebody cheering him on - until suddenly he finds himself in one of the groups named as an evil threat. Then it continues on with a kindly old man, a refugee from NAZI occupied Europe, explaining to the person how ALL Americans are real Americans - and how he had heard that exact same speech in Europe many times before he could get out.  The thing is - that speech, is utterly indistinguishable from the speeches Trump gave ever since he started his campaign and continue to give, including the one he gave recently at a boyscouts meeting of all places ! The generation who fought and died to defeat fascism was pretty damn clear that Trump's speeches are fascist speeches.

I am in complete agreement with the need (for there is no choice any longer) for these cut backs.  Tax hikes, fee increases all play a decent role in unaffordability. Businesses are impacted huge,  often """"times three,"""" regarding the tax and fee hikes. They in turn pass costs along or they close their doors.

0,"Unfortunately your argument is ignorant, Lela. Presidential elections under the National Popular Vote Compact would still be conducted by states, as prescribed by the Constitution, and votes would be counted just as they are now. The only difference is that, when those votes are totaled nationally, states which agree to participate would instruct their electors (in the Electoral College) to vote according to the national winner. That would encourage voting in every state nationwide -- whereas now both Republicans and Democrats have less incentive to vote in reliably Red or reliably Blue states. That would just be good, if more people were engaged in the political process and were therefore incentivized to learn more about public policy. That's called democracy, and it's what we'll need to protect and preserve our Republic and continue the creation of """"a more perfect union"""".

0,"There is no correlation between what Trump promises to do and what he can do, or even intends to do. The starting point for dealing with Trump -- whether one agrees with him or not, likes him or not, supports him or not -- the starting point must always be that nothing he says can be taken at fact value. Absent independent collaboration, one must always assume that Trump is lying and/or that he doesn't know what he's talking about. This is true, too, among the nations of the world; both our allies and our adversaries have to assume that what Trump says is meaningless. A few weeks ago, during a period of about 48 hours, the Vice President and the Secretaries of State, Defense and Homeland Security were in various parts of the world assuring different constituencies that Trump didn't mean what he said about NATO, about the European Union, about starting a war with Iraq to steal their oil, and about using the military to enforce immigration law.

As for the claim that a single payer system is the only sensible way to go, even Trump admitted this himself (see, among many other websites, http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/11/reid-ribble/donald-trump-wants-replace-obamacare-single-payer-/). What about the statement that the medical lobby is too powerful for a single payer system to ever become reality? If you believe that this is BS, please explain why.

0,"I am voting for Trump as well. We had our Clinton President. He made America the laughingstock because he cheated on his wife. He got caught getting bj's in the White House and he continually lied and lied and lied. Thank God she was smart enough to keep the dress! He did everything he could to ruin her reputation and lie after lie. He could have manned up and said, I am married, I had an affair, it takes 2 too tango, my sex life is not fodder for the world. I apologize. I was wrong. Please forgive me. The world was watching as our President make a mockery of our White House. Enough. I am voting for Trump. I am hoping he can dig us out of the trillions of dollars we are in debt. Good, bad or ugly he says what he feels, he isn't coached and lies do not roll of his tongue effortlessly like Clinton. I will take a chance, because God knows I regret voting for Obama the first time, the last time I made sure I didn't vote for him. We need someone with financial savvy for once.

0,"Trump is not a politician.  This much we have seen over the last four months.  Someone, or rather a lot of Republicans are running him for their own purpose.  There is also very possibly money coming from Russia, or maybe it's just payback time for available and cheap loans to Mr. Trump in the past.  And promises of red carpet treatment for Trump's further financial doings in Russia.  One thing is for sure, the Republican party is not as empty of nay-sayers as this writer lets on.  Yes it is time for all to speak up but for what.  For impeachment?  Would the country be better off with the Evangelical Pence?  A career politician, very flawed mind you and without much of ideological footing.  Maybe a crazy Trump is better for the Democrats, who will all appear in such a golden light by comparison and come 2018 and they will in all likelihood gain.  Still, as the New York Times has pointed out, very little stability is gained from disaster governments like this or from impeachments.

But he did not -- ever -- question the legitimacy of a federal judge (""""this so-called judge"""") or the integrity of a federal judge (because the judge was of Hispanic descent.)  Among American presidents, Trump is unique in his contempt for the rule of law and for American values and institutions. Will you take a crack at the questions I've posed to other Trump supporters (none of whom has answered): How would the right have responded -- ... if President Obama had dismissed a federal judge who ruled against him as """"this so-called judge""""? ... if a federal judge had dismissed President Trump as """"this so-called president""""? ... if President Obama or Secretary Clinton had posited, as Trump did, a moral equivalency between the homicidal maniac Putin and the American people, their military and their government?

When Trump went after CNN, after The New York Times, after Mika and Morning Joe he didn't do it quietly or in the normal politician walking on eggs to please everyone manner. Trump went after them-openly, publicly and he didn't mince words. He was not my first pick, but given the absolutely toxic nature of the far left in the Democrat party, he's the only one who would have lashed out in this way and gotten as much done.

Other organizations (SPLC, ADL, etc) also clearly have shown a double standard in favor of these anti-white groups while not hesitating to demonize individuals like Mr. Bannon.  So, while some may not like Mr. Bannon's appointment, it does make sense as far as representing voter interest goes.

Unfortunately, most don't seem to be self aware enough to realize that would have been their reaction.  They will claim that had Obama asked for it, they would have agreed because it would be looking for voter fraud, unfortunately, I call BS on that.  There would have been wailing and hand wringing from all of the right wing talking heads, and the same folks on here who defend everything about Trump would have been screaming states rights or what I suggested before.

Canadian nuke tech would at the same time, create numerous jobs, exporting the technology.

The first steps will likely be the come with replacement of the environmentally illiterate governments in Alberta and Ontario, with nuclear friendly conservatives. Ontario's lucrative wind/solar/gas backup contracts will be renegotiated dropping electricity rates to half current levels.

The US leader must treat congress with respect and provide it with significant relevant and meaningful information about its objectives in these talks.  Regrettably, Canadian leaders with majority governments have no such constraint and can treat parliament with secrecy, doublespeak and contempt if this is their desire.  Will PM Trudeau be forthcoming with parliament and with Canadians about what our objectives/wish list is for this new round of NAFTA negotiations?

He is hitting the major concerns of working people, and succeeding at them.

Sorry to break the news to you, but after 30 years of detailed investigation, neither federal special prosecutors nor Republican-led investigative committees were able to come up with any proof of criminal activity, settling for perjury before a grand jury regarding extramarital sex by the president, that was itself within the law.  Both Clintons have released their taxes and financial statements, while Trump refuses to do so.  Neither you nor anyone else has been able to prove a single charge of corruption against either Clinton, yet you and others nevertheless believe those accusations. That is logical disconnection.

When he has a choice, Trump goes with the racist approach, not the American one. . http://www.dorfonlaw.org/2017/09/trumps-white-supremacist-dna-on-display.html

We will never see a Trump policy that actually helps out the middle and working classes as promised. He and his cronies are selling the same old snake-oil.

Just what are they talking about?

King led the Selma March, faith leaders of all manner of denominations came together to march for Civil Rights even though many of their flocks told them to """"stay out of politics.""""  Now many faith leaders have allied with Donald Trump in hope that he will do their bidding.  It is refreshing to see that there still are some faith leaders who are not taken in by a conman like Trump and still stand for human decency.

Trudeau has already over-stayed his welcome, and his  left-wing antics (and hey, approving a pipeline that won't actually be built doesn't qualify as right-wing) virtually guarantee a reflexive snap-back to the right---unless he manipulates the voting system to his advantage.  The biggest risk of a future hard right turn from Canada isn't from Trump; it's actually from Trudeau (and Wynne).  Note to CPC:  Your list of leadership hopefuls is stunningly weak.

0,"The notion that DACA is somehow sacrosanct is bizarre.  It was simply a presidential executive order.  The left needs to get over itself.  Trump was elected on an anti-immigration platform.  Of course he is going to rescind measures like DACA.  Lesson for the Democrats is that if you want to make changes that endure you have to pass an act through congress.  Obama fell in love with the executive order as his #1 policy option.  Easy to pass, but equally easy to repeal.  Previous Democrats facing republican majorities in Congress - like Clinton - managed to make compromises and get legislation passed.  Obama never figured it out.

0,"From what I understand, trump wants to both show a 'win' to his base, and allow the 6 months for Congress to find a way to preserve it with modifications so that it looks like something new (even though it is the same).  There are enough republican legislators at state and federal levels that want to preserve the status quo, that the six month deal was cooked up.  Otherwise he would have cancelled it now.  The good/bad news for Canada in all of this, is that the 'dreamers' view themselves as American, and ain't goin nowhere.  The bad news? If they did move north, they at least speak English, and having been acculturated in the USA would be very likely not to look to the government for help in settling...in other words, too bad they ARE NOT coming, if Canada had its choice on who to host among people leaving the USA

Both claim to be for the common person but both were born wealthy and have little experience of real hardship.  Both thrive on being in the spotlight, and both give the uncanny impression that one is watching a reality TV show, instead of a real government.

The ex-cons involved are American citizens.  Because of background checks and such finding a place to live or to work is extremely difficult.  We have turned them into refugees within their own country, yet the libbers do not wish to grant them asylum.  I could understand protests against certain types of ex-cons such as pre-meditated murders, violent rapists, etc., but wanting to shut down the whole project is a reaction that trumps even Trump.

Ironically, the only people I hear talking about compromise and negotiation are Fr. Reese and DJT. These are strange times....  One of the things I do as a person living in a socioeconomic cocoon is reading the New York Post online. (I also read the L.A. Times, NYT, and WAPO). The Post is like a funhouse mirror of society, but typically reflects what people who are not like me think about life and the issues before us. Since the Post sells a lot of papers every morning, it shapes and is shaped by public opinion, even if that opinion doesn't resonate with my experience. Reading the Post helped me understand that Trump not only could win, but that many of the people who voted for him hated the Clintons in a visceral manner.  To the point: I think compromise is not possible right now, because that same kind of visceral response is raw in the open would of the election

But he was not entitled to a jury trial on this matter of contempt. The decision was proper and as an admitted violator of a clear and direct federal court order, Arpaio should not have been pardoned. Trump sent a message that the rule of law won't apply.

So columnists, bloggers, NGO workers, etc dominate the industry.  While successful women exist in business, engineering, finance, sport, music, etc, the percentage of such truly skilled women plummet within activist/feminist circles.

They name all kinds of reasons they dislike Clinton, and believe me, they're not shy. But, honestly, the fact that she's a woman doesn't come up.  The problem with making it all about sexism (and I know that's not what you're doing, Neko) is that it completely objectifies HRC. It makes her one and only defining quality that she's female. Personally, I would think that's a much bigger insult than admitting that the reasons for her her loss were many and complex.  As to why I think America is ready for a woman president, I just look around. Women of both parties are governors, senators, cabinet officers, ambassadors, etc. They've achieved the highest elective office in other major countries that seem no more enlightened than the U.S. Honestly, I think most people are fine with the idea.

0,"Since the GOP is little more than a white identity death cult these days, Trump is the perfect person to lead them. He is a tall, rich, white, man that has no respect for anyone, and that goes double if they are not white men. He speaks with a 3rd grade vocabulary so they can understand him. The """"poorly educated"""" white folks that voted for him are too ignorant to follow the money. They actually believe that the poor and minorities get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. They have not figured out what lobbyists do. They refuse to take responsibility for their choices. That is why they are the only demographic that is dying younger. They are dying from their own choices. They are angry about losing the white privilege that they claim doesn't exist. Merit and equality are demotions for them. They think they are victims while they continue to vote against their own interests. That is why Trump loves his """"poorly educated"""" followers. They are easy for him to con.

And Mencken, as everyone knows, was fascinated by Nietzsche. Yes, it all makes sense now. Just as that young boy's dream never escaped the sandlot, the Mencken worshipper's limits are circumscribed by carefully cataloged op-ed filler masquerading as reason and pith.

0,"In this area, I think Trump has done at least part of what he promised in his campaign. The significant drop in attempted border crossings is mentioned here but the numbers are close to half as many attempted border crossings now as compared to the same time of year while President Obama was in charge. Maybe there are other reasons for the drop but many have stated that Trump's enforcement is why they chose not to attempt to cross.  Trump has also hired more immigration judges, and moved some more into immigration courts.  What are the numbers of deportations if you don't take into account people turned away at the border?  Anyway, this isn't an immigration policy. We need to have a guest worker program, enforce an improved e-verify for all employment and government aid, and reduce foreign aid by the amount used to repatriate illegal aliens to their home country.

0,"No offense, but withdrawing from the Paris Agreement is symbolic.  Both sides may be right that it won't be as big or will be a bigger deal than anyone can imagine; but the truth is that it says a few things about our current leadership.  It shows that our current leadership will not necessarily honor any agreements made in the past 240 years.  It shows that our leadership cannot understand basic science nor economics.  It shows that our leadership does not comprehend the value of being a leader.  Oh well.  Clearly, the people who voted for Donald Trump and continue to support him despite all of this, perhaps, proves something else, maybe we deserve what we get.  What I find the most startling, however, is never before in the history of the USA has have so many egomaniacs been willing to gamble with the fate of the rest of us.  Maybe Trump is right, but when all indicators say he's not, how can the Trump supporters and the President be willing to risk the future of the entire planet?

OTOH, in his last year, he ran up the deficit like there was no tomorrow. 3) you are correct that CLinton WAS impeached. Of course, it was for lying under oath, nothing else. OTOH, Nixon left office because impeachment proceedings were about to start.

0,"In the U.S., there are many different, and often conflicting, ideas and beliefs about what constitutes moral legitimacy in governing.  The Civil War, the suffrage movement, and the civil rights movement taught us that.  And the election of Mr. Trump is one more example.  For Trump supporters, his election and his presidency already have moral legitimacy.  For them, all he has to do, once in office, is keep the moral legitimacy he already has earned.  Those of us with a different understanding of moral legitimacy in governing may not like it, but it is what it is.  Our job is to make sure that our competing understanding of moral legitimacy in governing is heard, seen, and acted on whenever and wherever possible.  This has already begun with such activities as the Women's March and the Sanctuary Movement.

0,"I cannot discern any swing to the right at all in the broad electorate. I also think that a claim of """"three election cycles of Republican victories"""" misses the demographic trends that are actually the future of the country.  What there has been is an utterly brilliant and wildly-successful Republican effort by people like Karl Rove (Google """"Project REDMAP 2010"""" for the diabolical details) to build an impregnable majority in the House of Representatives—while losing the vote count in the states they represent.  In House races in 2012, 1.7 million more votes were cast for Democrats than for Republicans. And still, thanks to the way those votes were """"packed and cracked"""" by control of redistricting, Republicans came away with thirty-three more congressional seats.  A Trumpocalypse, if such a thing is possible, could put seemingly safe districts in play. But few pundits see that as likely.  That is not the same as winning the hearts and minds of the electorate.

Not because he doesn't have one of his own, but because of Dem footdragging in the Senate confirmation process, the full DOS complement of appointees is being slow walked.  All your examples were Obama failures.  Especially qaddafi.  I still wonder why he didn't promote himself from Colonel all those years, but I digress.  I just hope our President doesn't try the out-of-session appointment trick, but waiting until the end of the month for Congress to come back is frustrating.  Rep. Gabbard, for what it's worth, is speaking her mind and her thoughts outside of any influence from most in her party and is being both chastised and lauded.

Adolescents are weak by comparison with adults as they lack economic power in society and have less experience on which to draw for self-defense. 20-somethings are so young, in fact, that they might actually still be living in the bedroom in which they grew up, with posters of their teen idols still hanging on the wall, so your disparagement of them only reveals how depraved your worldview is, Earl:XratEd, that the only thing you can say is that these victims is that they are """"weak."""" They are disadvantaged, and are aware of it which is why their response to sexual assault is sometimes weak. As far as waiting for what the judges have to say about Trump, you only have to wait about 26 more days.

Not voting does not absolve anyone of anything. Voting for Trump--well, there's no need for a description of what that is but some Sanders' supporters have stated they're ready to do it. And there's voting for Clinton which is voting for another Obama. Actually, HRC is more to the left than Obama so that's a slight improvement. If you help Trump win over imaginary scruples for voting for Clinton--I assume you voted for Obama, right?--then you are a help to Trump and the Republicans and you're part of the problem--really it's people like you the wishy washy whom fascists like Trump rely upon to do nothing in the face of overt fascism.

However, many of his political positions certainly support Christian values far more than his opponent's values did, and have a greater likelihood of producing a more free, prosperous and strong America where Christian values can flourish. So I voted for and support many (not all) of the policies of Mr. Trump. Those who assume my choice and support to be un-Christian might want to consider which party has in its platform a plank supporting the killing of nearly 60 million American children and counting since 1973 (https://www.democrats.org/party-platform#reproductive-health). My Christian values prevent me from voting for any candidate or party who supports that and wants to use our taxes to continue it by repealing the Hyde Amendment. All Christians should disavow government supported abortion. Support live birth and adoption instead.

Not being experienced in the least in public office, I believe Trump will have many, many days like this to come.  He is unprepared - as many of us knew - for this office and the huge amounts of vital information that must be retained - something that no business person is at all experienced in.  He is going to falter and fail, no matter who he gathers around him because, as we all have heard from every President, there are those hours in which they are left alone in having to make a decision that impacts the entire world.  Thinking like a businessman is not a solid base on which to stand.

Justin Trudeau has yet to see a international trade agreement that he does not want to sign undemocratically, committing Canada and Canadians. Fresh from lecturing deepest, darkest Africa on the newest liberal agenda, LGBT rights, Trudeau seeks to deepen ties with dictatorships. Opening special access to Trudeau's Liberal government to China's billionaires ought to be ringing alarm bells.

Those who do walk in can simply tunnel or use ladders unless there are guards to stop them. But more importantly, American businesses, especially agriculture and services depend on these immigrants, legal or not, to pick crops and clean hotel rooms.  Jobs Americans don't want.

This was never about some high minded, or principled effort at governance.  It was always about Donald Trump feeding his inner most, deepest appetites.  Ego, self-interest, and the desire for adulation, attention and reaction that feeds both, and assuages the ugliness he truly sees in the mirror (and no doubt, in his base).  Here's where Trump is at:  """"I know no one except my White followers will listen to me, so, I'll give them no choice but to listen to me.""""  His tools?  Police/military power to eliminate and intimidate, and stirring up his civilian base to take matters into their own hands.  How did we get here?
"
0,"An odd position.  Oil is dropping due to Middle East squabbling and Trump's intention to sell off strategic reserves.  Third world demand isn't as high as expected, and most people are driving more fuel efficient cars.  Canadian energy is difficult and expensive to extract compared to most.  I am struggling to see the upside here.  If oil prices rise, there will be more shale rigs in the US, which will push prices down again.  Peak oil was largely a myth -- we will be moving away from dinosaur fuel for other reasons than lack of supply.

0,"I can understand why some women dislike Trump and I admire anyone who has sufficient strength of conviction to attend protests such as this. I can also understand why Trump has become president and I do not believe it was on the strength of his appeal as a person. Rather, he was elected as an instrument of political change given a large portion of  US voters were fed-up with the complacency of both political establishments. Trump is not a dedicated liberal or conservative and he is very unpredictable. He is not beholden to any particular interest and certainly owes little to the Republican Party. No one, liberal,conservative or media pundit, can really forecast what he will do or how he will perform as President. There are no shortage of problems facing the country both internally and externally. They have been left festering for some time and are the driving force behind the desire for political change. Apprehension in these circumstances is understandable but the die has been cast.

Trump won 3,084 of them. Clinton won 57.  There are 62 counties in New York State. Trump won 46 of them. Clinton won 16.  Clinton won the popular vote by approx. 1.5 million votes.  In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump. (Clinton only won 4 of these counties; Trump won Richmond)  Therefore these 5 counties alone, more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country.

"
0,"""""Based on the authors examples of Trump and vaccines, the author is talking about sympathy and compassion, both of which require of us to take sides.""""  That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side.  The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.  At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.

Country-building is a never-ending process and most US politicians (including Presidents) stopped doing this a long time ago. Poverty and racism were never solved in the US, they were only suppressed as forefront issues that required some leadership to resolve. Just as Obama's legacy (along with Hillary's candidacy) gave rise to Trump, so (hopefully, if our American brothers and sisters learn their lesson) will Trump's Presidency give rise to someone who can mend the US.

1,"I feel it's important to point out that the rally in Charlottesville was not just racist. It was anti-Semitic and it was anti-LGBTQ as well. The slurs the Nazis and KKK were using moved from racial slurs to gay slurs to anti-Semitic slurs with frightening regularity. They wanted to make sure they terrorized certain groups of people and they did just that. Jewish folks, LGBTQ and people of color are now feeling trepidation when walking home alone at night in Charlottesville (and many other areas of this country). I only mention this because Trump has already broken his word on """"supporting LGBTQ people"""" and it makes me wonder if that's who he'll hit next in order to rally his base AGAIN. Since the Nazi's were very vocal in their gay hate rhetoric in Charlottesville, I think it's a subject that should be discussed openly and honestly before something bad happens and Catholics wish they had spoken against the homophobic rhetoric being spewed by the Nazis. My two cents worth.

That's why Trump assertion to the contrary was properly rated false.  FYI, a fiduciary duty is defined as """"A legal obligation of one party to act in the best interest of another.""""

0,"I am not suggesting that the EC vote was close, it was not. However it was not a landslide either, as Trumps EC victory ranks 46th out of 58 elections. Barack Obama placed 32nd (2008) and 37th (2012), but I digress. Reagan was the last real EC landslide in the modern era, with just under 98% of EC votes. My point, of course, is that Trump and his people keep saying landslide-not true and the inference of total domination is completely false.  Your suggestion that people are simply looking for a handout is repugnant; people have issues, so you stand in judgement?  http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/18/us/elections/donald-trump-electoral-college-popular-vote.html?_r=0  Kellyanne Conway tweeted """"306.

I often get the two confused) and now Berkley we a see a massive turn out for counter-protesters.  One explanation for this is that there is a clear disinterest by Trump to condemn racism.  At best, he'll offer lip service and only after vehement condemnation by his own party.  This is only further supported by Trump's pardon of Arpaio's racist conduct in direct contradiction to Constitutional protections for US citizens and legal visitors in the US. [I don't see how Trump being all of the bad things you mention justifies] The point is not about """"justification"""" but about rational, plausible belief.  You should realize how a person's """"belief system"""" (which is how I believe you justify your subjective conclusions) can create an incentive if not an outright need to act.

0,"What the Democrats fail to acknowledge is Bush had already set the recovery in motion before Obama even took office. Bush's TARP bill funded the stabilization of our financial and banking industries and Bush's loans to GM and Chrysler was sufficient to fund a chapter 11 bankruptcy. These actions took place BEFORE Obama took office. Trump rolling back many of Obama's regulations on businesses did more for the economy that all of that money Obama handed out to his campaign contributors. That is why the market started moving up the moment Trump won. Obama and his agenda was the main reason for the slowest and longest recovery since the great depression. The Trump administration has given the market a positive attitude and a reason to believe in the American Dream again. That is what Trump has done.

Same thing in the Kansas race to replace Mike Pompeo, who left to be CIA Director. Romney beat Obama by 25 percent, and Trump won by 27 percent just last November.  Yesterday, the GOP candidate won by just 7 percent.  Is the Trump effect good or bad?

How much longer are you going to use the  'it's not Obama' arguments?    Has Trump slowed the rate of killing in the Middle East?

Sadly, Too many people fall for all the garbage those on the 'Left' spout and often blindly vote for someone worthless (Obama is case in point).

Trumps failures are due to congress, both democrats and republicans. He has a backlog of no-brainer appointees even the Republican never-Trumpers will not get done...and they could, easily.  Trump cant sign bills he has not been provided and he cant approve his own appointees to fill the vacancies.

0,"I suggest that you read up a bit on the history. There is a mnemonic about the fates of Henry VI's wives: """"Divorced, beheaded, died. Divorced, beheaded, survived."""" Henry VIII beheaded two of his wives, Anne Boleyn (on trumped-up charges) and Catherine Howard (on quite legitimate charges -- adultery by the queen was treason under the statute). Of the others, two were divorced (one for non-consumation), one died in childbirth and the sixth outlived him.  Henry actually had solid grounds for an annulment. His father, Henry VII, arranged a marriage between his eldest son, Arthur, and Catherine of Aragon. A few months afterwards, Arthur died. The king wanted to keep the Catherine's dowry (over a million in today's currency, which would have had to be repaid out of the Privy Purse). So he decided to marry his second son, Henry, to Catherine. There was a problem: Under Church marriage law, one cannot marry one's deceased spouse's sibling.

I never thought the crisis would come so soon, but it seems imminent. For the check and balances to work, the members of the other branches have to have the courage and integrity to put the country before their party allegiances and their own careers. The Nixon presidency ended because, when the crisis came, members of his own party loved the country more than the party or their careers. We don’t know yet whether the Republicans of 2017 have that sort of courage or integrity, but I’m encouraged by the fact that other than the folks who are paid to lie for Trump, no one is supporting his lie about the wiretaps.

Indeed, he never specified precisely what about the report was inaccurate, nor did he offer information in its place that he deems to be accurate. Nor did the report specifically state that anyone had done anything untoward, only that sources the newspaper trusts said there was contact. Whether that contact was improper or illegal has yet to be determined.  And, oh by the way, the FBI is still looking into that very thing. If former director had said the entire matter is fiction, there would be no reason for the FBI to continue that investigation – especially while Mr. Comey was still director.  What Mr. Ruder is apparently annoyed with may be the press’s First Amendment freedom to publish information that he doesn’t want to hear.  The larger concern is and should be that President Trump appears to have tried to influence the FBI director and its work. That didn't change.

There will be no winners if he keeps blundering ahead with what he thinks he knows.  One of the main problems with Trump is that he is the emperor with no clothes. Those he trusts won't tell him the truth, and he dismisses anyone he does not trust.

Trump did and said what he had to to get elected, and to get past the entrenched corrupt political elite.

It is the same dynamic that causes both liberal and conservative governments in Canada to allow large scale immigration continuously; it is the surest way to increase and stimulate economic growth.  It's just math.  Rhetoric to the contrary by political leaders is either for expedience to appeal to an ignorant voter base;  or just plain ignorance themselves.

The same is not true for the President of the United States.  What the President says involves the force of law.

0,"Oh, also, coal exports and the success and failure of local coal terminals has more to do with the consumption of the resource by China and where that monolith chooses to purchase that resource, than any of the nonsensical posturing by local activists. There is a glut on the coal market in China right now, lignite coal used for power generation and also anthracite coal which is used in steel production. While China has a robust domestic coal industry, Australia remains its current largest coal partner. But throwing a wild card in the mix is the fact that North Korea is the main supplier of China's anthracite coal. That is until this past month where China - working in conjunction with the Trump Administration - has embargoed North Korean coal as warning to the country not to pursue a nuclear weapons program. While China has sufficient coal stockpiles at the moment, should they begin to dwindle and a NORK embargo remain in place, the US could find itself stepping in to fill the gap.

My guess is the Judges' political affiliations will outweigh their duty to the law and the state will win. It will then be overturned in the Supreme Court.

He goes over to Europe and trashes our great president only because he knows he will never accomplish what President Trump has accomplished in seven short months.  Hopefully, he will be gone before long.  He's fast becoming the most hated man in the United States.

0,".  The posts here today are showing that the pro-Assad, pro-Putin posters are now bailing out on Trump. D-I-V-O-R-C-E!  The reality is that this ineffective and inconsequential action by Trump was all for show.  Trump notified the Russians ahead of time, so as not to strike any of Russia's military.  Putin then warned Assad who moved his significant assets to cover.  Trump's attack failed to destroy any Syrian aircraft other than half a dozen or so that were inoperable and not moved to shelter.  He didn't even take out the runways at the Syrian airbase from which the chemical attack was launched.  This was all for US domestic consumption, just posturing.  Trump knows how to pull off a good con.  Now he will now go back to golfing and doing whatever his boss in Moscow tells him to do.  .

It needs a publication whose primary focus is the news and a well-informed Canadian middle-class, and which understands that news is a lot more complicated than just mouthing slogans about the evils of xenophobia/Trump/_______. It needs a publication capable of reporting, and reporting well, for all Canadians.

Mr. Rosenstein did so and now Trump tells us that the firing was not """"top down"""", but came UP and was based on Mr. Rosenstein's condemnation of Mr. Comey.  Mr. Rosenstein didn't have the courage to say """"NO"""" to President Trump and, instead, weilded the ax for him.  His reward?

Previously, he has expressed admiration for the type of autocratic rule that exists in China and in Cuba and for their rulers. In this way he is no different from his father. By letting the Chinese by this company he is endangering Canada's and western national security. He has lied on many of his election promises which he made just to get elected and this shows he is a liar and has no integrity.

Enough with the virtue signaling. Republicans are not going to work to uphold liberal values and beliefs. If Democrats ever wish to hold power outside of a handful of major population centers, they need to find the center of the road again.

Environmental Protection may be done away with entirely except for a skeleton staff.  Other Government departments may be gutted as well.  Taxes will be lowered as he promised.  Border tariffs will be for selected countries and that Mexican border wall may be a high fence called a barrier where required.  Lets see how these predictions work out.
"
0,"I too  disagree with much of  this article. Bernie staying in the race gives the Dems a strong candidate in case Hillary's FBI case goes awry. Everyone knows that there are at least five Southern states that Hillary won that will inevitably go to the Republicans this November. When one discounts those states and votes, Bernie is the stronger candidate against Trump. Many of us will not vote to put Bill back in the White House, we just won't. We will write in someone. Unless Bernie or someone like him is on Hillary's ticket, Trump stands the stronger chance. Our country is apparently about to hold an election where the two choices are a ( I think) false populist Trump, who is ignorant of how government works, or a third term for NAFTA Bill Clinton. Let Bernie run long and loud, and let us, his friends, vote for him. Then let either he, or Elizabeth Warren, run as a VP. That might mitigate some of the fear we would have of a Hillary/Sherrod  ticket. Hugh Massengill, Eugene

That has never been tested in court, and as a basic principle, using the pardon power as a means of obstructing justice in respect of your own wrongdoings or abuse of power might be a bridge too far for any judge nurtured in a system built on the rule of law. .

China President Xi is undertaking a program to suppress what few rights China citizens have. But Trudueau (with the help of then Global Affairs Minister Stephane Ddion) slavishly obey the Canada-China business lobby, and therefore are quite wiling to ignore Chinese human right violations.  So enter President-elect Trump. No human-rights supporter he, Trump will be fighting China on the free trade front, in his fight tp bolster US manufacturing. This has Canada's China lobby scared, in the sense that it has links to the US-China lobby and the repressive China Xi government itself. The posted article is true, that Canada under the new Cabinet can act as ago-between between the two superpowers.  Perhaps a deal can be reached, but human rights will be ignored in any agreement.

It is highly unlikely that anything is going to change that fact. The Liberal/left/progressives are entitled to protest and question the outcome but, other than causing a hardening the political resolve of the new president's supporters, nothing is going to change until the next election. If Liberal/left/progressives are under the illusion that they can somehow wrest power from Trump and those who elected him, they might want to acquaint themselves with the results of America's last civil war.

If you want someone to blame for this chant blame Notley for breaking her promises to the voters. Blame Notley for catering to special interests instead of the people.  You can condemn it all you want, like you condemned Trump, but you can't stop what's coming.  The only way to stop it is to start governing for the benefit of the people instead of the special interests.

Has a brown immigrant personally done you wrong at some point? Does that mean all immigrants are to blame for your problems? Shall we make it easy and just declare them and Muslims as our scapegoats as the Nazis did with the many sub-cultures they persecuted and murdered? Trump is openly blaming a religious group and immigrants for our problems. He is the most dangerous man in the United States of America. Walls never fix anything and always cause increased tensions. Walls come down. Teachers taught you history and why it's important, for the progress of the human race, to heed the warnings of our past so as not to repeat them in the present.

0,"Well said.  Trump presumably considers himself a good man, he is obviously a man of action who will never be accused of doing nothing, and he considers radical Islamic terrorism by ISIS and others to be the biggest evil of our time.  So the president would probably agree unreservedly with Burke and accordingly will aggressively act to marginalize ISIS and other terrorist organizations and enhance border and internal US security.  Trump would not, for example, pull the US fighter planes out of the war against ISIS.  Nor would he declare the US to be the world's first post-national state.  Aside from being consistent with the campaign promises he made and was elected on, there is a case to be made that this is the rational response against terrorism.  Hopefully, better vetting systems and processes will be in place within weeks and these temporary bans will prove to be temporary.  Meanwhile, it makes sense as Wente says for us to curb our self righteousness and mind our own business

Nothing like having someone with a heightened sense of motivation.  I'm very much anticipating some fireworks from Scaramucci.  The media will go apoplectic, as will the dems and some repubs to boot.  Then he can fire the other barrel and dump Sessions and bring someone in who will get down to business and """"lock her up"""".

His lying is not a rare last resort, or like, say, Dwight Eisenhower’s 1960 claim the U.S. wasn’t flying spy planes over the Soviet Union, done (however foolishly) to protect our national security.

Nevertheless, the silent majority of public opinion in the US appears to be on Trump's side.

The violence would not be happening if these new Nazis did not feel that you have given them free reign to do and say whatever they want. We dealt with this once, 80 years ago. We KNOW what this is.

I don't read First Things often, either, and will do so even less now that they've banned me (apparently for posting the same criticisms of the GOP I've made here). In my view First Things is fostering a culture of paranoia and alarmism, and the illusion of persecution, on the Catholic right. This problem isn't going to go away after the election.

1,"Fake news? If the """"Russian"""" part of this story proves to be real, this is likely the biggest political scandal in American history - maybe world history. It even includes Russian """"agents"""" in what is """"Hollywood movie-like-plots"""" of Presidential behavior . Trump is either a crook or a pathetic politician who is manipulated by his strange and sinister group of advisors. Regarding Russia, it is one of the slimiest and most-corrupt nations on earth - from its leader Putin down to its taxi-drivers. Don't ever """"trust"""" Russia fully. In the U.S.A, the nearest Congressional elections are in only 18 months and if the Republicans continue to stumble badly before them, they could lose their majority in the House of Representatives. Trump - or his successor Pence - won't be able to get things through Congress easily at all. And I think things will go so badly among Americans this summer that we will have thousands of demonstrators in the streets and even even clashes with police.

You voted and it exposed the true underbelly of the so-called conservatives.  Any claim to holding a moral high ground is now lost to the Republicans.  When so called conservatives voted to install an admitted sexual predator in the White House, a weak man unfit for the office, a man who is wholly self absorbed in his own insecurities and his own neurosis's, that marks the point where conservatives lost.  When that man brought white supremacists and nationalists into his administration, you lost.  When that man tried to usurp the Constitution, you lost.

Lashing out with personal attacks toward other people in his party and his cabinet, making ill-advised decisions about national security, and making enemies with anyone who disagrees with his unique point of view only builds resentment and dissent among the international community and Americans.  I don't recall ever seeing anyone, including Obama, do anything so counterproductive. Just saying....

After Trump is replaced and seeks asylum in Russia,  those with 50% Russian DNA will be sent to internment camps.

Offer to lead a military offensive with China's help. If they agree,  go to the UN and let them know of the plan. I say """"let them know"""" because they couldn't stop us and China even if they wanted to, so it would be a courtesy and a call to any other nation that wants NK taken out. As stated earlier, I don't believe Trump or his administration are competent enough to organize and carry out such a complicated military plan. Congress would have to agree to funding and they hate Trump's guts, so I doubt anything will happen.

I will again express my layman's opinion that Donald Trump is a sociopath and has brought that very warped worldview to the office of the Presidency.

Mattis will see that they get the war they wanted with the Great Satan, and if they're suppressed in the Mideast, they'll just take the fight to American shores.  Remember those words over the next four years.  Trump was very much ISIL's candidate.  He's clueless enough, and inexperienced enough, to bring the U.S. into Mideast war, and maybe even kindle a World War.  Mattis will be his cheerleader.  This was a popular but stupid nomination, and we can only hope against probability that the U.S. Senate will come to their senses and block it.  They have an easy out, because, against the rules, Gen. Mattis has only been retired a few years.  The U.S. will emerge from this next four years weaker and poorer, and the course the damage will take is already beginning to be drawn..

But it 's done.  Democracy has spoken.  Maybe an excellent wakeup call for the polarized U.S. and the leftwing progressives who have forgotten to take the 'depolorables' into consideration.  So enough with the hand-wringing and agonizing already .  To all the actors, academics and disappointed  Democrats living in the U.S. you should work at making the best of it and keep America safe.

What does require Mueller to resign is that his appointment became tainted the minute Comey decided to wait until after that appointment to publicly reveal Comey had never been investigating Trump. Comey thereby made it impossible for Mueller to maintain the integrity of a Special Counsel.

The country should emulate NY state where business is booming. The reason it is booming is no corporate taxes, no property taxes and income taxes for a period of ten years to new business. Also a lot of reducing of the regulatory burden. The work force is expanding greatly, creating thousands of new taxpayers. Oh, that's right, that is what Trump is proposing.

0,"""""Global Warming"""", """"Climate Change"""", """"Greenhouse Effect"""", """"Carbon Footprint"""".  Something is going on.  Appears that the Trump position is that all those things in quotes is pure fiction.  So, his approach is to deny they exist, take no proactive or solution oriented action, and, in fact, undo efforts to address them.  If he had one proposal to address things in at least some way, other than simply denying the science or even the concern, then he might garner some credibility.  Instead, he pursues the whacko internet perspective expertly propogated by polluting industry.  Could that mean our President is  a gullible whacko internet warrior at heart (he certainly doesn't """"produce"""" anything like the industrialists who really oppose the concept of climate change control do)?   Or, a greedy opportunist seeking, hoping or expecting to profit at the expense of the environment and those who must live in it?

But in addition to all the other panicked flailing, there’s this gambit that seems to have gotten fairly little notice.

His serial lies about the ex-President's birthplace were debunked almost immediately, yet he willfully and continually repeated that false information, to his own benefit, for years. When, at the final moment of truth, he was asked to defend or refute his lies, he gave the wimpiest response possible, neither admitting to his lies nor defending his point.

The story in the article Joan Williams tells about her father could be told by hundreds of thousands of non-white lower-middle/working class folks too. The difference is that historically non-whites have not sunk to voting for overtly misogynist and racist candidates and they certainly haven't been gullible enough to place their faith in some rich con man who promises a return to the days before technology replaced muscle power.

He wasn't stunned enough, however, to offer his resignation -- now get this -- Mueller's resignation as well, when he faced a similar situation in a meeting with Pres.

Harth voluntarily withdrew the suit when her husband settled a parallel case. Trump has called the allegations """"meritless"""".  Put into context with other contemporaneous claims, though, and an obvious pattern emerges. It may not all be true but you're fooling yourself if you think none of it is.

What is important is that they get along on a personal level; if they don't, it won't be for any lack of respect, reasonableness and charm on Trudeau's part.  With the growing number of nations wary of this new U.S. administration, Trump may be looking to make the most from a visit of a popular G7 leader whose country poses no threat to America or its economy. Taking a harsh public stance on Trump's policies won't achieve anything and could undermine any future bilateral initiatives.

So, again, I'm not quite following your """"he didn't have the votes"""" mantra. Under your theory, the Buffalo Bills actually won all four of those Super Bowls, the Russian hockey team won the gold medal in 1980, and Napoleon prevailed at Waterloo.

0,"Schembri’s speech showed how the Bank of Canada is constrained, quite appropriately, by its need to be politically impartial. Business investment, as the Conservative opposition has repeatedly said, is being stymied by the Liberal government raising business costs with higher taxes and their socialist lite threats to raise taxes on the rich. These weren’t acted on in this budget but the continued warnings from Morneau raise business anxieties. It would have been better to get all such measures implemented in the first budget, so the business community knew what kind of business environment they would have to operate in. And now the Trudeau government’s grossly irresponsible refugee policies are threatening to thicken the border between Canada and the US when the Trump regime inevitably responds. That must be another disincentive for businesses to invest in this country.

We need to keep NAFTA and make corrections (bring up minimum wages, esp in mexico and clean up environment), but need to kill off China trade slowly.  We also need to change our corporate taxes. Basically, drop all taxes on any good/service produced in America. Start it with anything that has 50+% American COG/Service, and increase that by 5% over 8 years, requiring 90% American Cog/Service. Then replace that with 20% VAT on all goods/services esp including anything imported. At that point, it makes us similar to Mexico, China, and the rest of the world, though CHina has over 500+ tariffs on western goods. We need to implement the exact same tariffs on Chinese made or even chinese companies made elsewhere, goods.

The Constitution may seem unwieldy and strange during the good times but it was really designed very much for the potential of very bad times.

Just this week we find that Obama's former AG used an alias to try and control the media into not reporting her """"family discussion"""" with Billy prior to the JD not going after Hillary. We have a lot of unmasking requests, and classified info released by Obama's former UN Ambassador. And they you have the curious case of Ben Rhoades. Give it time, for now the market is over 22,000, hiring is up and for the first time in a long time wages are up. I guess all we needed was Obama out of office for the economy to improve.

0,"I am not sure what all this hoop-la is all about. Did anyone read this treaty? I took the short cut and read the Wikipedia. Trump stated that US will withdraw but it not going to happen now. In fact, we can't withdraw until 2020....our election year!! Anyone think that will be a political football during that year?? Another thing is, this treaty isn't binding to any nation which is why most of the world signed it......it more like a PR job. It doesn't force any nation to do anything so it won't solved global warming but it does sound like we are all singing """"We are The World"""" song. Why Trump would even bother making this an issue probably reflects greatly on his own ability to create his own problems. Non-binding treaties are collector's delights.

0,"As Dolphin743 stated, there is nothing wrong with Conway's sitting on the couch with her legs under her as she was just trying to get a picture of these African American academic executives with Trump.  The only other option is to get off the couch and stand in front of the couch but then she would have blocked the view of Trump and his visitors to the rest of the media taking pictures. Nothing disrespectful or sexual with Conway's kneeling on the couch.  The Dems are pretty desperate if the best they can do is attack Conway for trying to take pictures of African Amercian academic execs with Trump.  And completely stoopid for a Demo African American congressman to make a sexual reference to Conway on the couch when it was Demo Bill Clinton in private using a cigar and messing up Lewinsky's blue dress in the Clinton's oral office.  Actually for Conway to kneel on the couch and not block the picture of the African American execs with Trump in the oval office, was a sign of respect

0,"Not really.  There are just a few of them left.  But what does Trump have to do with this, other than the fact that Elway and Bowlen support him?

Then they invented the Iron Chink, and the U.S. Exclusion Act of 1882, with forced removal of many """"opium den smokers."""" One of my great uncle's chopped off a stoners pony tale as a teenager, that chinaman didn't make it to heaven. Just go ask Murkoswki, Young, Stevens, and the rest of the local dope smoking drug addicts in Congress about their cheap foreign labor importing that shit today? Ted Steven's pony tail got chopped off,  and missed his trip to heaven, after leaving the village. Sold his old soul and the whole North Pacific Ocean to a Chinese Pig Farmer from Tennessee, Trident Seafoods. In 1903, Edmund A. Smith patented the Iron Chink. VOTE TRUMP and learn how to spell 1882 EXCLUSION ACT. Inbreeding democrats have been the same forever. http://www.historylink.org/File/10919

0,"As a temporary relief for the shortage of scare quotes, considering some of the following:  In plain ascii text, you can use single quotes.  E.g. Trump's 'integrity'  In addition, in anything in rich text, you can use quotes from different fonts.  I'm sure there is a large surplus of italic quotes on back shelves.  In addition, you can get extra scare by using Helvetica bold condensed quotes. As a font it's not commonly used, so there should be a good supply on hand at your local type foundry.  For a prissier feel, use quotes from fonts like Zaph Chancery, and for something sinister, from Bastarda.

0,"Hillary Clinton got about 2.7 million more votes than Trump in the U.S. federal election. She won the popular vote.  If Hillary Clinton got more votes and won the popular vote, why wouldn't the electoral college voters make Hillary Clinton president of the U.S.A.?  Wouldn't that be the democratic thing to do?  What kind of an electoral system do they have in the U.S.A. anyway?  Are PM Trudeau and his Liberals in Canada looking into that electoral system? lol

0,"Lazeelink writes:  """"Age is not a consideration or requirement to serve on the SCOTUS. Sorry.""""  ---  Not referring to their chronological age.  The dinosaur reference is referring to the sociological and cultural belief characteristics of so many of the SCOTUS nominees list that Trump published during the campaign, and of his appointees thus far.  One of them was even named """"Rex, T.""""  The Gong Show, straight from the Paleolithic Period.

0,"Clinton's actions beyond delusional- what actions?  Paying for some lawyers to make sure a recount is done properly?  What harm in that?  It's not public money.  The recount shows nothing- nothing changes.  Why the indignation?  Trump has the power to do something about it.  He can propose and pass legislation.  He can have the FBI open an investigation.  He can have people arrested.  Why does he not seem interested in those options?  Wouldn't being aware of millions of illegal votes, and doing nothing about it- be the real slap in the face to democracy?

0,"You're mixing apples and oranges. Number of votes in a three party race and approval ratings are two different things.  Last poll from IPSOS had Trudeau's approval on April 1 at 56%; and even higher in Ontario and Quebec.  Trump's approval rating in the USA is 42%, the lowest in history for a President at the 100 day mark.  (Business Insider).

0,"Seriously?  Trump already had no clothes back when he... the list is like 400 items long. Why did it take you so long to catch on?
"
0,"Well the rule in business, or in any other endevour, is """"sometimes you win and sometimes you lose"""".  It's how you approach things afterwards that counts.  Giving up has never been part of President Trump's makeup. Admire that or not.
