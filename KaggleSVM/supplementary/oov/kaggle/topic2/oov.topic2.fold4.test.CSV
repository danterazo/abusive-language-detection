1,"That comment made me laugh this morning. That woman is as crazy as it gets. Who do you think she is going to support in the election, now that she has denounced Trump? Because he not going to step aside.

0,"Is this site even remotely interested in the right to life and Trump's multiple steps to defend it? Or is abortion on demand OK with NCR, as long as the Wokes like Hillary and Obama march with the Social Justice Warriors?

0,"The people most hurt by low voter turnouts are conservatives . By staying home they allowed Obama to get a second term , hurting America .  By staying home they allowed pot to become legal . By staying home they allowed liberals to get elected to the assembly.  And most of all, by staying home they allowed property taxes to be raised at a time , given our current economic uncertainty , when they shouldn't have been.  Unions , gays , and other special interest groups win when conservatives stay home and don't vote .  Conservatives have no one else to blame but themselves for the way Anchorage is going down the tubes . At least they saved the nation by getting out to vote and electing Trump. We are really up a creek by the new mail in ballot system.  Special interest groups will gather up ballots and block vote.  Dumb voters with no knowledge of the issues will make bad choices .Those who pay no property taxes will approve every bond put on the ballot.  Dark days lay ahead for our city.

0,"Amy Bollenbach - So what you have your fingers crossed for is to shred the Constitution, which does not allow electors to go against the popular vote within their own states. You do understand that is what happened -- the popular vote within 30 states fell for Trump rather than Clinton.  In your dream world where the electors revolt against the Constitution and their own state's popular vote, you would then install Clinton, who lost the popular vote in all of those states. I suppose you would then insist that those people, who won the election by following the rules, sit down and shut up for yet another 4-8 years while your chosen dictator continues to suck the life out of the producing part of this country so that their kids have no choice but to march off to wars she starts in order to feed their families.  What you are proposing is a dictatorship where the will of the people based upon preset rules means nothing.

0,"I surely hope President Elect Trump is smart enough not to consider Mr. Giliam. A quick look into Mr. Gillam's past and his association with Ralph Whitmore, Alaska National Bank of the North, Joe Miller and the failure of Home Savings should end Mr. Giliam's political ambitions.

0,"I am a Canadian with a mostly American family so I have some insight on what is going on with our neighbours to the south.  Most of my family are Republicans who did not vote for Trump because they realized that  he would be a disaster for their country and here they are with a train wreck running the country.

0,"If all the major news channels are saying his supporters were bussed in, they were bussed in. Trump is an groping opportunistic liar, who does not care who suffers from the results of his grand illusions. Maybe if his male supporters could line up their wives and daughters for him to grope and grab their pu--ies, they would have a clearer picture of what this silver spooned leech is like. Could you volunteer your wife and daughter to Trump?

0,"Interesting how this morning the Liberals were being called out for their ineptitude at filling vacancies, and suddenly they fill a supreme court seat to deflect attention.  Almost as interesting is how optics nearly trumped competence once again. Justin's photo-op chasing is really getting old.

0,"It IS going to be 8 years.  Trump will have America at war, well before the first term ends, and America does not dump their President when the country is at war.
"
0,"Fortunately, John Snow on CH 4 was aware of where the 'America First' mantra came from and he asked those he was interviewing about it, certainly implying that it was frightening. Julius Krein dismissed it saying there was no connection and, in any case, lots of politicians use this mantra all the time. In fact, Krein said exactly the same on every issue that the panel were asked about. Nothing special about Trumps unprovoked verbal attack on China two weeks ago - all Presidents attack China. The fact that nowhere in Trumps speech was there a single mention of the Constitution - few Presidents mention it in their speech - was the response. I then realised Krein is just a lickspittle neo-con.  Michael Moore also gave a powerful interview drawing a connection between Trump and his followers, and the Germany of the 1930's. (As others have done.) His speech, his sloganeering and the sycophancy of his followers certainly have similarities.

0,"""""Trump is a businessman..""""  Yes, Trump is a businessman.  And THAT is why he is doing so poorly at being president.  Trump has no idea whatsoever how governments work.

0,"I don't think Trump will do nearly as much damage to the environment as the Iranians and Koreans will with atomic weapons - thanks to Obama!
"
0,"I agree that there has been a lack of enthusiasm for Trump in the foreign press.  To operate at the level of business that Trump does, you have to learn about diplomacy and how to handle politics.   As far as Palin vs. Obama goes, it was also pointed out at the time that Obama had less experience than she did in a number of areas.   One of these is that she had to deal with Russia being a next door neighbor.   What foreign experience did Obama have at that time?   I know he had been to some other countries growing up.  This is where he began getting an anti-America indoctrination.

0,"Maybe Trump is purposely trying to blow it so Hillary gets in office. After all he did donate a nice sum to the Clinton's in the past. Smoke and mirrors. Let the circus show continue.
"
0,"So if the results of the election were reversed, & Trump won the popular vote, would you say this country is """"saddled"""" with a out of date system?  Or would be dancing in the street, to the tune of """"WE WON""""?
"
0,"By the time O'Leary gets to an election there should be serious curbs in place on fake news. They will prevent most of the excesses of the recent US election.  Fake news must have influenced the votes of as many as 2% of all voters. That was just enough to change the outcome of the election. In other words without fake news Trump would have lost.  I do not see O'Leary doing well as a politician.
"
0,"Silent majority? Fake news?, """"Some of my best friends are Indians"""", """"I've suffered too!""""  Sheesh! The new Queen of Tired (to the point of exhaustion) Cliches. The woman can't resist dragging out these silly, much ridiculed rationalizations. Perhaps she 'identifies' with the struggles of discredited American political buffoons like Nixon and Trump?  I can't decide whether Harper appointed her to represent low-intelligence voters or to further tarnish the reputation of the Senate.
"
0,"We will have to forgive Goldberg. He is still a bit drunk from his recent year or so of #NeverTrump, only to be so rudely corrected by the recent election. Getting liberals on record as accepting federalism while Republicans hold power, then expecting them to stand by that principle when Democrats regain power is like expecting a tranquilized bear who is groggily lured into the relocation truck by a fish in your hand not maul you for it after it wakens from hibernation the next spring. It is their nature, predatory, filthy animals that they are. Bears, that is.

0,"Trump doesn't have a clue what he is talking about on most topics so no sesnse trying to rationalize what is plan is on any of it. The next four years will be filled with one disaster after the next.

1,"I don't give a crap about Trump, I give a crap about decent reporting​, which the DP lacks at times. Everybody has a complaint about fake this, fake that, most of that could be solved with decent reporting. Everything is on the level of a blog these days, it's ridiculous.  You don't post his 8:55 tweet but skip his 8:45 then skip what Mattis said, that's bull and gives anyone paying attention pause about the intent of the whole damn article. Not to mention it gives Trump another excuse to cry about Fake News. This crap is never gonna stop.  Everyone knows he can't """"shut up NBC"""" I mean, c'mon. He's being a blowhard again, people really need to stop being surprised by that.
"
1,"What a laugh,  You MAGAphants and Fox lapdogs control both houses of Congress and the presidency and you can't get anything done.  In case you hadn't noticed, the Dems are totally silent, not trying to sell anything, as Ryan, Trump, and McConnell make fools of themselves.  And in turn they make their apologists even look more foolish (talking to you Downwindman).  But please keep posting.  You MAGAphants with you hair on fire are starting to come out of the woodwork and really hit your ill-informed stride.

0,"The right like Newton and you would derogate is our most important freedom. The first amendment protects our  press,  speech our right to challenge and to gather together in protest or action as well as our freedom of faith. See https://www.quora.com/Is-there-freedom-of-speech-in-Russia They deal with journalists like Ms Moore. They have all kinds of contempt for the things you think are left and liberal. Maybe you should emigrate if your hero is not elected. I have many issues with our country but unlike others I am free to tell the world what they are and free to do something about them. I despise, for example,  the blatant lies by the huckster Trump and the Faux news but I would despise more a country like Canada that prohibits Faux or like Russia that assassinates those whose lies are contrary to the official lies.
"
0,"Right, lying about a consensual adult relationship that he should have never been asked about. So much worse than what Trump is now doing and has done, right?  Let's get Trump on the stand, under oath, shall we?  I'd pay to see that.  No false equivalency, if you don't mind.

Hey why don't you volunteer to do clinic escorting and you can see how your charming """"conservatives"""" really behave.  It's pretty funny to have Trump, the king of bad behavior, at the top of your party and then make the claim that conservatives are respectful people. I mean, it's comical, man.
"
0,"I'm sure the gang banger was there before Trump won. Maybe you're new to the phenomenon of crime in urban areas. Crime is not new. There will be gang bangers when the protests stop and you'll go back to not talking about it. Most of the people who are against Trump are young and not generally violent but you know that motleycrew, you just like to pretend otherwise. The protesting kids will be remaking America into a better, less disgustingly racist place and codgers like you will be lucky to have Medicare when Republicans and the Trump robbers are through with you.
"
1,"""""loose talk""""????  I'll have you know, NP5491, that I chose those words very, very carefully.  I watched, I thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that Trump is an idiot.  Just because well foundationed, rational and justifiable description doesn't fit into your fantasies of a world actually ruled by Trump, doesn't mean they aren't well foundationed, rational and justifiable.  One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:  """"a foolish or stupid person""""  So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.  Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.  Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not).

Please slow-walk us through the details of that case, also unsealed today, and tell me more about how the Trump campaign isn't caught up in this. Please also tell me what you think it means that Pap pleaded to a single count & claims in his signing statement that he has more information.  Or... you know, you could just do like the other apologists are doing and mumble something about Uranium One.

"
0,"Treason is a bit of a leap, but the meeting was clearly inappropriate, which is why the White House is denying President Trump had any knowledge of the conference. It's hard to believe that Donald Trump was unaware about a meeting in his office building where the topic was his political rival. My doubt is especially strong when you consider that the meeting included a lawyer connected with the Kremlin, a personal friend connected with Russian oligarchs, his campaign manager, his son, and his son in law. The """"Russia story"""" is not going away and it is leading this administration to impotence.
"
0,"The problem with the GOP/TP and Pres. Trump is that they are NOT being  honest with their voters. If you want good healthcare (unless it is subsidized by the gov) it is going to cost much. That is just the fact of life, that is economics.. AND, NO PARTY regardless of stripe- can go against the time proven economic principles. If you want cheaper healthcare cost be prepared to accept sub-part service. Period. Pick your choice. Why is it that the USA is the ONLY developed country in the entire world that does not provide universal coverage for its citizens? And, why is it that the GOP/TP is the ONLY conservative party in the developed world that opposes such a thing? Thatcher and Cameron of the UK, Harper of Canada, Abbot of Australia, Merkel of Germany (all conservatives) support their individual country's universal healthcare system.
"
1,"""""unhinged fantasies have fizzled, and now the excuses begin."""" Are you looking in the mirror and talking to yourself again, snarky.  I'm certainly not crushed about this nor pretending to be happy that this is finally happening since I, along with most liberals (we are more educated, you know) realize this is just the first step. We don't know the future, but trust that justice will prevail.  Mueller is the perfect person for this.  I remember Watergate, the sequence of events how long those investigations took, the recalcitrant Congress and suffering Nixon - who unbelievably was not as bad as tRump with potential collusion (money laundering, tax evasion etc along with the obstruction of justice) and am thrilled it isn't taking as long. Impeached, indicted, locked in a padded room, his family paying the price for his and their actions - whatever happens in the future, we are living in the moment. He is a lame duck and a pathetic liability for the GOP and will stay that way, no matter.
"
0,"I wonder how long before the Democrats in Congress discover that by acquiescing in Obama's """"I can of anything I want because I won the election."""" attitude is evil because President Trump has now adopted that attitude in its entirety?  And how many people on these threads will have to be reminded by me and my magic videos (which never, ever go away)  that Obama invented the hubris and arrogance on all those topics.  Killing US citizens in drone strikes without judicial involvement is just one of many places where Obama's """"Power of the Pen"""" can, and probably will be converted to Trump's  """"Power of the Pen"""".  Senator Wyden and Representative DeFazio are a couple of the few voices in the Democratic wilderness who have been talking about the Obama usurpation of congressional powers and the laws passed by the Congress.  This will be  a Democratic """"You reap what you sow"""" reality for the next four years.
"
0,"I am amazed at the vehemence of the commentary on this topic.  Yes, this judge made an error in judgement - as the judicial council panel noted, judges must not only be unbiased, they cannot act in such a way as to even _appear_ biased.  However, it isn't really reasonable to create such a fuss over wearing a hat, particularly a hat with such a restrained slogan.  Let's be honest, if it wasn't for it's association with Mr Trump, the slogan would be completely inoffensive.  Honestly, I think that suspending the judge over this was excessive.

0,"I'm a liberal-leaning, patriot who is in favor of a more restrictive immigration policy for everyone across the globe, including making our borders more secure against illegal immigration.

As we've learned from sources close to him, he knew the """"Mexico is going to pay"""" was a lie from the beginning.  So, here we are today: those of us who truly pay the fed. government's bills are the ones being threatened, if we don't now pay up.  Apparently, lying is essential to """"The Art of the Deal.

Had Trump been mayor for the last 8 years do you believe the project would have been approved? Do you believe it would be 6-7 billion over budget (and counting, remember there's a lot left to build; trains, power stations, on and on) if  Trump were running the show? Or maybe you believe the situation would be worse?  When Trump sees a problem, and he sees many, he simply tries to fix it.  I should those on the island would tend to envy such an attribute.

0,"One thing is absolutely certain whether Trump realizes it or not.... China will never bargain away Taiwan, no matter what threats Trump makes. Trump has absolutely no realistic  leverage to apply. Boycott Chinese goods or impose tariffs? China will simply find new emerging markets in places like India, African countries, and South America. And if not, they'll simply suck up the losses. It's not like their government is accountable to the people so there will be no political pressure. And in the meantime, American consumers will find that the things they buy regularly will suddenly become unaffordable. Add to that the loss of jobs in retail as businesses go broke because their customers can no longer afford to buy their wares and Trump's promise to create jobs falls flat. China, like it or not, is not a country that can be bullied.

0,"Premature Exclaimejactulation.  Rim shot.  So why did the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee stand in front of the tv cameras today and announce that he had just read intelligence papers that say,  outright,  that the Obama Presidency ordered Trump surveilled,  unilaterally, downgraded the gathered information to where it was widely disseminated in order to make it easier to leak,  all before Trump was ever sworn in as President.  All of which means that what you heard from Comey, et al,  was BS,  blather,  deflection, parsing words,  and we are not anywhere near the bottom of this investigation and issue.  The Obama Presidency,  his Administration,  his name on the door labeled """"POTUS"""",  did in fact surveil,  secretly,  the communications of the Trump organization before the election and until the last day of that Presidency,  and all of the information was unilaterally downgraded in classification level to enable more risk free leaking of it to Democrat resistance organizers.
"
0,"Apart from his miscommunication on the where the Navy Carrier group was headed-- which was viewed as a bluff or mistake which is a sign of weakness-- Trump has done a good job of increasing the pressure on China to step up sanctions on North Korea, and on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. The question is what the next step is to add to the pressure and that would be more action by China to quickly stop trading with North Korea. According to Trump's people, that might mean some offers to China, including promises to remove US troops and anti-aircraft missles once NK had destroyed its nuclear weapons and agreed to an inspection and enforcement program.
"
0,"The way to counter lies would be with facts. . But Trump's opponents, despite many accusations and predictions, never produce facts. . For example, take the assertion that he """"called Mexicans rapists"""".  This was an oft-repeated trope in the media, but when you go and read what he actually said, the FACT is that he was refering specifically to illegal immigrants being more likely to have criminal reasons for crossing illegally. Not """"Mexicans"""" in general. . Most of Trump's alleged atrocities are like that: a grotesque misrepresentation is spun by the media as an """"alternative reality"""".

0,"BTW President Trump is now trying to 'fix' a broken immigration system that Obama merely wrapped a piece of duct tape around.  He dithered for 8 long years neither reaching out to Congress or working within his own administration to come up with a viable solution.  And now Trump is facing it head on and is willing and eager to work with Democrats to address DACA and provide a 'legal' means of citizenship to those who were brought here by their parents. Nobody wants to see them thrown out. . It is up to the  Congress to work 'with' the President and not throw up cardboard roadblocks and 'fake' detours.  Their theatrics may make for good 'sound bites' on TV, but it's  extremely  poor policy and governance. If Nancy and Chuck are truly sincere, then let's work on this and get it done.  If DACA recipients can legally stay and we can get better security on our borders, it's a win, win!  Anything wrong with that?

0,"Martin was only able to balance the budget because he massively cut education and health-care transfers to the Provinces. He simply downloaded the problem to the Provinces. Between the second quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2015, Canada’s real GDP grew 13.3 per cent. The second best performer over the same period was the United States, which saw its economy grow by 11.9 per cent. - source OECD. The deficit in 2008 was to prevent us from cratering with the recession. Your facts and reasoning are bogus. Trudeau lied his face off during the election when he claimed a $10 billion deficit only. Conservatives knew he would blow that up and, of course, he has done that spectacularly. He's a simpleton who was only elected on an anti-Harper vote and he's as unfit for the office of PM as Trump is for the Presidency.

There is one model that seems to work better than others, however, and that's the one in the United States, where immigrants are permitted to retain their own cultural practices provided their primary allegiance is to their new country. I believe that one (pre-Trump) study indicated that about 8 in 10 Muslims were either happy or very happy to be in the U.S., while, on the other hand, a 2016 study indicated that 61 percent of Canadian Muslims identified primarily as being Muslim rather than Canadian, suggesting that our open-ended brand of multiculturalism, which demands little of immigrants, is less successfully integrative than is the more compelling American """"melting pot"""" model.

Fortunately, we don't have slavery anymore -- the """"former slaves"""" can vote for themselves -- so it's time to move on to one-person, one-vote.

He  has never grown into a real adult, a spoiled child in a 71 year old body, who has repeatedly shown that he has no impulse control, no tolerance for criticism- factors that led to his many business failures, because he would not listen to those with expertise who dissented from his grandiose schemes.

0,"""""I am really thinking Trump has early dementia."""" . Very possible. Watch the Rona Barrett interview on YouTube when he was 33 years old. He's calm, rational and polite. No crazy hand gestures. No yelling. Some of the comments were like """"What happened to this guy? He seems so normal."""" Then watch the 1998 interview with Larry King and you start to see the crazy coming out. He seems to slowly have devolved into the monster he is today. Getting that game show didn't help either as he seems stuck in that cartoon-tRump mode. Of course it might just be the slow degeneration of syphilis. Can't rule that out.
"
0,"""""But almost half the voters TOLERATE Trump's Pandora's box of evils.""""  I suspect what is more accurate is that some embraced Trump's hateful rhetoric, some tolerated it and some dismissed it as B.S. I have no idea how the percentages shake out.  There are a lot of people who seem to have summed Trump as a mere blowhard, a man who doesn't really believe in anything other than personal profit. They interpreted some of the more outlandish things he said as campaign hyperbole. Mind you, I think they're dead wrong and I hope we don't end up paying a high price for their miscalculation, but that seems to be the case nonetheless.

1,"So you're arguing that Americans are lazier or more worthless than Europeans? Friend, unemployment is at historically low levels. EMPLOYMENT, the number of Americans actually working, has, under Obama, steadily climbing. Simply, there is no objective evidence that a social safety net discourages work. None, at all. Yes, raising the minimum wage may increase the cost of goods--- so feel free, as a consumer, not to buy them. But also know that for the hundreds of thousands that now have more wages, they will be increasing THEIR purchasing power. They, of course, will need less government assistance. It's obvious that the poor and middle-class have remained stagnant while the wealthy have become ridiculously more so. I guess you're okay with that. Trickle-down worked for you, I guess. How many more presidencies and Voodoo experiments will you need? You think that millionaires and billionaires like Bush, Romney, Trump will help you have a better chance in life? Oh, c'mon!

When all he said was:  """"There are tremendous opportunities for countries like Canada and Ireland, at a time where perhaps our significant allies and trading partners in the case of both the U.S. and the U.K. are turning inward or at least turning into a different direction,”     What a misdirected headline and inane comment by a country that gets most of its money from the USA. versus (2)Obama touts Paris accord despite 'temporary absence of US leadership' OK you tell me that 18 months of this BS bigotry by our press and Trump still is at 50% approval according to Reuters.

More pointedly LESS REPUBLICANS would have laid the events at his feet. [There's no apology for their hate.] But given Trump's actions today there are certainly a lot of attempts to distract from their hate. [An honest conversation about race...] is nigh impossible in this current politically entrenched environment.  It doesn't help any that Trump hates on anyone who disagrees with him even if they are from his own party (McConnell) even if they are one of his earliest supporters (Sessions).  His every action condones if not and arguably outright officially sanctions hatred and bullying in his belief of what he does is right and good or to put it another way, """"Modern Day Presidential.""""

I've never been a fan of itemized deductions because they cater too far to particular interest groups for no real reason. My big concern with this plan so far, as with the Republicans' numerous attempts at Health Care, is they are trying to sell us something without the details sufficiently hammered out. Even Republicans admit all the numbers haven't been worked out. This is where the mess starts. This is where unintended loopholes or domino effects get created that can tank an economy. I want to see a tax plan thoroughly conceived, all possibilities pondered, all i's dotted and t's crossed, so we don't end up with another ACA or Trumpcare Bill that will need a reboot in 2 years. The big problem with Congress this year is they just want to pass something, anything, as fast as possible, regardless if it works or not. If they take their time and do it right, they can get their win.

First he sends Sessions out to rail about 'sanctuary cities', then he starts anew tweeting about Hillary Clinton, and  then he tries to rally the base by appealing to their hate of President Obama the person.  If an issue was important to President Obama, Trump feels a need to attempt to erase anything the President Obama was successful at.  HIs EO here is more of the same.

This is a serious problem which needs investigation. The leaders of both parties agree with this. There are links between the Russian hackers and cyber attackers to persons in the United States and to Wikileaks-- as yet unknown and this needs to be investigated. There are several persons involved in Trump's campaign who had involvements with Russia-- but not necessarily with any knowledge or direct involvement in the election hacking-- but this needs investigation.

Right now Tesla vehicles are popular, expensive and making big money.  Soon they will offer a much cheaper vehicle, the Model 3 yet will still be superior to what all other manufacturers are building, except maybe for the Chevy Bolt.  Of course, except,in Hawaii, gas is cheap so big US manufacturers don't want to look ahead and build advanced, affordable electric vehicles.  Trump does not have to participate in the Paris Accord to create incentives in going to electric vehicles, however he does have some kind of pathetic hangup with coal mining jobs.  Give more grants to MIT, Caltech, Stanford, etc. to develop next generation SAFE nuclear power electric generations, possibly on the pebble-based nuclear reactor design, that cannot go Chernobyl or Fukushima.

Trumps victory is a great lesson in politics but how it was accomplished is what a lot of people are having a problem with. That being said, I am ready to move on and see what Trump can do for us but so far, it's been one issue after another. Many of which will impact our lives tremendously. EPA, financial laws rollbacks, foreign relations etc. Seems the Democrats in congress is giving Trump as much of a chance as Obama. Not sure if you remember when leaders in both chambers (republican), on the day of Obama's inauguration make national statements of their intention to block anything Obama wants to do. They carried out their plan. They failed to make Obama a one term president though. I tried to find any FOX news articles that was positive on any Obama efforts and couldn't find any thing.

It’s something that happened that may be in the public interest or of interest to the public.  In fact protests turned violent and that some voices have been shouted down on college campuses. To ignore it would be a news media failing.  Oh, and conservatives do not “run all three branches of the federal government.” Donald Trump is not an ideological conservative; that eliminates the executive branch. You might argue that Chief Justice John Roberts is a conservative, although I wouldn’t, but he doesn’t necessarily “run” the judicial branch; ask Clarence Thomas or Ruth Bader Ginsburg if they answer to Roberts. And many conservative voters (and Trumpbots too) disagree that Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are all that conservative.

1,"Earlier on Thursday, Canadian government officials said they recently reviewed the Trump administration's immigration policies and found that the United States is a safe country for refugees. The conclusion means that a bilateral agreement requiring people to be sent back across the border if they claim refugee status after entering Canada through an official U.S. border crossing still stands.  Seriously, they just checked now to see if the USA is a safe country? This should have been done at the beginning of the this entire illegal migration fiasco and most of the migrants should have been sent back to the USA,  but is typical for these Liberal clowns running our country.

When Trump signalled a desire to reconcile and perhaps work together (without recourse to war) these people you call adults would have none of that.  The  possibility that these interests manufactured the gas attack of last week to ensure that Trump would be forced to challenge Russia is there. There is still no conclusive evidence that either Russia or Syria is responsible - but ambiguity is the propagandists friend isn't it?  So the US pushes further at the UN for access to  Syrian air fields and failing that for more coercive strategies (look up Res 688 concerning the no fly zone over Iraq).  Fortunately the G8 refused to impose more sanctions on Russia - with Germany leading the way. The US goal is clear - more war.

0,"Simply saying that I would not work at an evangelical college -- or at any institutions -- which demands Catholic faculty assent to the college's creed, as it were, or mission statement. Catholic academics cannot teach at many evangelical schools, in the first place. That's fine with me. They won't even be hired or considered. That's religious power foreordained. That trumps my career and belief at many evangelical colleges. And that is fine with me. Why would a Catholic academic go there in the first place? If my values would be compromised at Brigham Young University or the evangelical Wheaton College or Calvin College, I wouldn't go there. Period.  And it someone wants to fight that, hire a lawyer. Go all the way, as my dad (a lawyer) would say. Fight. Let the Supreme Court decide if Wheaton can trump my Catholic witness.

0,"If trump were truly encouraging violence, don't you think that after all of this time on the campaign trail there would have been violence? The only violence that has occurred inside of a Trump rally is when liberals go in and try to take the stage from Trump. He kicks them out of there, and they get violent as they're being ejected. Tell me this. What exactly has Trump said that encourages violence? Other than telling his security to kick the bums out of his rally? And even in those cases the violence was initiated by the liberals. So what racist statement has Trump specifically made that encourages violence among his followers?
"
0,"This is a line in the sand.  Yes it will be tough but ENOUGH is enough.  The Americans who support Trump need to see clearly that there are consequences to elections.

I’m an immigrant, I have no fear of laws that deport people who didn’t come here legally like my family did, if anything I encourage the government to crack down on people who cheat the system.

Oil from Canada, US corn sales to Mexico), identify alternatives, and be prepared to walk away from NAFTA.  The US congress and senate will have a meltdown and Trump will never get their support.

0,"Reciprocity is much more honest concept than the so called """"Free Trade"""". Punitive tariffs unilaterally imposed by one side though justification repeatedly discredited as evidenced by the softwood lumber imbroglio, points to poor contract terms, bad faith and an absence of goodwill. Demanding renegotiation on terms demonstrably favourable to one party (America First) whilst under threat of cancellation, casts a pall of extortion over rapprochement. Canada being the inferior partner to this agreement is reluctant to challenge inherent unfairness. The importance of an agreement of rules, effective adjudication and respect means more to Canada. There are terms in Free Trade / NAFTA that should never have been agreed to by a nation intent on maintaining sovereignty, such as the Proportional Energy Sharing Clause. The Dispute Settlement Mechanism, rationale for the massive transfer of Canada's sovereignty, has proved inadequate.  Should Trudeau renegotiate with Trump under these conditions?
"
0,"I disagree that us""""progressives"""" (pretty divisive way to start your comment) ever refused to acknowledge Ms. Clinton's shortcomings.  What you see as denial was, in fact, several other things: (1) an appreciation of HRC's contributions to this country - and particularly for children and families - over the past 30 years; (2) compared to Mr. Trump, HRC was clearly the less toxic of the two - by far, and it is that extreme imbalance that pushed more voters to support her then Trump.  She has the popular vote, and he has the electoral vote.  How many times have I heard those from the far right complain and degrade the idea that the Electoral College even exists - until today!.  Rather two-faced, isn't it?  Let me offer you a way out of your one-sided, and limited view, of the bigger picture.  We had the poorest choices to make in this election of any I know of: Trump created such deep divisions I do not think they can be bridged.  Even if they can, the issue is WHERE DO WE GO NOW?

Remember that Trump looks up to Vladimir Putin, not because he's a nice guy, but quite the opposite, because he is a strong authoritarian. A rational person would conclude that Donald J. Trump is an avid proto-authoritarian.  Never thought I'd see the day the President of the United State of America defend neo-Nazis, KKK & White Supremacist.  Didn't we fight Nazi's in WWII against Hitler's fascist?  And now our President is defending them?  Trump spoke from his heart today and showed everyone who he really is. He lied Monday with his statements.  This is about hate & race.  He used racists dog whistles all throughout his campaign. """"Make America Great Again,"""" huge dog whistle.

0,"I don’t think this is a good moment to split the opposition to Donald Trump. We saw how that worked out in 2000. Were it not for Ralph Nader’s siphoning progressive voters from Al Gore, Gore would have defeated George W. Bush.  Perhaps Gore would not have been as good a president as Ralph Nader but I feel assured that he would not have left West Asia (Eurocentrically known as the Middle East) in tatters by invading a stable Iraq that had not attacked us; would not have appointed two conservative Supreme Court Justices including Chief Justice Roberts and the extraordinarily conservative Samuel Alioto; would not have abandoned New Orleans’ black residents immediately after Hurricane Katrina.  I’ll believe in the viability of a third party presidential candidate when I see a substantial number of third party Senators and Representatives. Under the Electoral College system now in place, we have only Senator Sanders of Vermont who is not from the two major parties.

Talk to middle class Americans and ask them what they think Obamacare?  Everything bit of actual evidence I have seen it is a disaster.  I suspect the establishment Republicans like McCain, Ryan and Graham don't like Trump as they attacked him hard and did not help him get elected after he was selected by the party.  So the authors think Trump demonizes Muslims.  I guess Muslim terrorism has nothing to do with a temporary travel ban for 90 days for 6 countries where nobody can vet someone's background.  I guess it is racist for the USA to enforce immigration laws with around 20 million illegals and when Mexico has a wall on the southern border and removes illegal Central Americans aggressively.

0,"I very much fear for the future of our country. As far as I know, this is the first time one extreme party has total control of all three branches of government (assuming Trump has a Supreme Court nominee who gets confirmed). The goal of Republicans and the majority of Trump's nominees seems to be to do everything in their power to dismantle our government, give more power to the 1% and enrich their own pockets. It is hoped that by mid-term elections people will have woken up to what is going on and will vote enough of them out to turn over Congress. But a lot of permanent damage can be done before that. However a change in Congress depends on Trump not getting us into a new world war, which looks probable. He and Putin may be buddy, buddy now but when it comes down to it you have two macho, schoolyard bullies who both think they are 100% right and entitled to do whatever they want. Scary times ahead.

The idea that a regulation will cost too much, or be too hard to implement, is what industry puts forward every time. It doesn’t matter how little it will actually cost or how tripping-over-own-feet easy it is to put in place.   But that’s okay, because Pruitt is willing to go along with industry. Every time.

The fact is Trump is an economic liberal based on his free market platforms, corporate tax cuts and keeping NAFTA and even wanting to use the IMF and World Bank. Most economic nationalists would want a state bank and some kind of measures to challenge globalist hegemony. He is also not challenging the war agenda.

If you want to drive a coffin on wheels just to save a few bucks on gas, we'll let ya, but we'll be damned if we're going to let the EPA force us to do it.  Congress hasn't passed a clean power plan.  The EPA went well beyond it's authority given it in the Clean Air and Water Act by making AGW it's agenda.  It calls CO2 a """"pollutant"""" so it can regulate everything, but it isn't a pollutant.  By the time the Trump administration is finished giving the EPA a haircut, you won't recognize.  This country is sick and tired of elitists like you telling us that you know better how we should live our lives than we do.  We're kicking you out.  Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.

0,"Campbell Clark misses the point.  The good neighbour, build personal relationships aspect of Canada's response to the NAFTA renegotiation challenge was surely never seen by our negotiating team as the core of our negotiation strategy.  That core strategy is (a) sound research, (b) detailed analysis not only of the issues likely to be raised but also of the domestic business & political audiences in the US with which the team needed to mobilize as allies & (c) a determination to resolutely stay on topic despite the clear Trump tactic of sowing chaos to gain a negotiation upper hand.  To their credit, our negotiators have delivered on that core strategy. The charm offensive aspect is merely a tactic designed to minimize the effect of Trump's fostering of chaos, retain some control of the agenda & force the US negotiators to realize that they will sholder the responsibility for any damage they cause to US interests domestically and internationally.

But the comment that probably ought to spur even more thought in Democratic lawmakers’ offices is this one from Chris Murphy, who dares to utter the heretical thought that the preeminent obsession of Democrats since Election Day 2016 — the as-yet-unproven possibility of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign — simply is a non-factor in the lives of most Americans.

Polls shows that journalism is one of the least respected professions in the country, and with Trump calling out media organizations for their bias, widespread slanted reporting is bound to reinforce this point — and to backfire. Trump’s campaign is throwing down the gauntlet to the political class. If journalists are seen as the mouthpiece of that class, they may soon find themselves covering Trump’s inauguration.

0,"Trump is using classic """"divide and conquer"""" tactics. He is ripping up every multi-lateral trade agreement and then going to each individual country to negotiate a separate trade agreement where the smaller country stands alone rather than together with the others. Trump just said that he wants bilateral agreements with each country and if they don't agree to his demands they will get an even worse agreement if they come back a second time. The only recourse in this situation is for the smaller countries to band together and say no. If Trump does anything against one of them they all collectively have to take punitive trade measures against the US in response. That is the only way pain can be inflicted on the US in proportion. Obviously this seems extremely difficult to do but if Trump is not opposed he will keep coming back for more and it will be virtually impossible to undo the one-sided agreements he seeks. Trump has to be stopped before he gets this train rolling to disaster.

If Hillary is elected this suit will be dropped immediately to avoid a counter suit. Notice also that the person providing corroboration would be admitting to felonies of her own, but, surprise, the statute of limitations is likely expired. Why isn't she being sued?

If there ever is another terror attack organized from Canada, (such as the 1999 millennium bomber, Rassad from Montreal who crossed from BC into the US with a trunkful of explosives), the US will shut the Canada border so fast and effectively it will deservedly devastate Canada's economy for months. That's under Obama. I could only imagine the wrath of an enraged Trump if such an attack from Canada ever happened.

0,"Senator Rubio: I voted for you -- and convinced others -- in the Virginia GOP primary because you'd stood up to Toddler Trump and called him a """"con man"""" -- which he no doubt still is.  Now, you've pointed out that accepting Putin over election tampering is ridiculous.  Please, Senator Rubio, this time continue to stand up for America to this Dictator Devotee. You can be the one to save American democracy BUT not if you get scared of the far right hate and only if you truly put America First -- before party.  Your party (our party in the past) has been hijacked by haters and you can be the savior.  Please continue to stand up to  that Alternate Human. Remember that almost everyone who pays any attention recognizes how disturbing Mr. Trump is and that is filtering down to those who don't pay attention.

As much as we might disagree on some of the social issues I think we can agree that Trump's policies on immigration and torture are concerning, to say the least, and the effect that he inspires in some of his followers worries even a conservative such as myself.  His policies on Russia are also troubling, to say the least.

And it may also have been about a woman losing the election.  Someday, those, who are so aroused right now, are going to figure out these things about this past election:  Donald Trump won, in spite of his sizable personal faults, not because of them. Demonstrating about those is fruitless. Hillary Clinton lost, not because she was a woman, but because she was a candidate otherwise so terrible that many women would not vote for her. """"Women's issues"""" as defined by the far left are not selling well with white women or white men - or, very likely, with many in minority communities - were it not for their habitual group alignment with the left over their minority identity.  Planned Parenthood will now lose its funding. That funding will go instead to clinics that actually render women's health services - other than abortion.

There are many such links.  I didn't speculate about whether Trump meant what he said, or whether he would be able to get those tariffs in place, given strong opposition from every responsible direction. That was beyond my chosen scope.  I take people at their word, especially when they are in responsible positions. It is horrifying to me that a presidential candidate would utter such demagogic promises to great applause and cheers, and then abrogate those promises without a peep from the audience, who continue to think that Hillary is corrupt when she isn't, and that Trump isn't corrupt. He is.

That would indicate either a completely arbitrary approach to the matter or a complete lack of understanding of the situation.

This is like the criminal who hides evidence in the trunk of his car and tells the police that they're allowed to look anywhere except the car's trunk.    You can't make this stuff up. Incidentally, here's a tip to Trump's lawyers:   you might want to stay away from the """"statute of limitations"""" argument.    There is no statute of limitations on tax fraud.   Given that Donald has been suspected of keeping multiple sets of books, it's pretty likely that if Mueller and his team can't find at least 20 instances of tax fraud, they aren't putting much effort into the search.

The Trudeau Liberals will likely do the same but not before they've saddled us with extra taxes. Ontario is still suffering from the Liberal Green Energy fiasco launched by McGuinty. There are real questions that the Conservatives need to ask themselves - and the public. Such as. How much are you willing to pay to subsidize green initiatives? How much are you willing to pay into the global wealth transfer as laid down in Paris? Does it matter that big emitters like India and China will actually be increasing emissions during the Paris agreement? Is it important that Canada set an example even if our reductions will have negligible effect?

If it were true, it would be very easy for the Republican Party to change its implicitly racist Southern Strategy to a new Southern Strategy, rewarding African-American votes with jobs, education, and programs.  It hasn't done so, presumably to avoid alienating its base, evangelicals and less educated white people, especially in the South, who the Republican Party itself has treated as closet bigots, justly or not.  I agree that the majority of Americans are hungry for change, although Americans disagree widely about what that change should entail - progress or a return to the past.  That is just one of the reasons for the drastic political and social polarization we see among our citizens today.

The GOP just needs to bide their time.  One way or another Trump will be forced out of power or sidelined, leaving Mike Pence in charge.  With conservatives controlling both houses of Congress, the Presidency and (shortly) the Supreme Court in addition to a majority of State governments, we will then witness a destructive rightward shift in American legislative politics.  They will do as much damage as possible before 2020 and then trust in the Supreme Court to maintain the new status quo for a decade or two more.  Truly, the results of the 2016 election are disastrous and will be felt by many of us for a long time.

He can spin, polish or blatantly lie to his millions of Twitter followers, driving home his message without interference. Over and over again.

Fact is, our hills are covered with 40 year old trees, but the problem for the mills is mainly a lack of good markets, given Canadian imports, so most of those logs are going to the coast to be shipped out rather than milled, as any visitor to North Bend can see.  Having been thrilled with a $2 an hour summer sawmill job back in the 1950s, I'd hardly call those crappy jobs- we desperately need family-wage blue collar jobs, if automation in the mills will still allow for these.

I spent my teaching/counseling career working with dysfunctional adolescents...some of whom were clinically and legally defined as sociopaths.  I didn't """"hate"""" them.  However, I didn't elect them to be President of the United States either.  IMO, Trump is a very disturbed and potentially a very dangerous man.  He should not be occupying the most powerful office in the world.  He is and it concerns me.  I think it's also starting to concern more and more Americans.....regards, Gary Crum

Tom Marino about his direct ties to drug companies, he more than likely would have been our new drug czar, based simply on his early loyalty and endorsement to Trump. The pharmaceutical industries would had their Man on the inside overseeing drug-control policies in the midst of the opioid epidemic.

In one article, he said a lot of stuff written by reporters contain many incorrect details. For example, reporters said he started the Baseball Abstract in his garage which was wasn't true. Trying to correct all the details will drive you crazy.  Donald Trump seems only concerned about accuracy when it pertains to himself and his viewpoint. He should really relax about the small stuff.

But any prosecutor could have chosen to review the results if the investigation, and most likely did. There was no there, there, as is the case with 99.9% of the witch hunts against Clinton.  The GOP just refuses to believe that Clinton won't engage in the wrongdoing as they routinely do, so they keep after her, looking for evidence of criminality.  Yes, Comey went beyond the norm in what he did and he shouldn't have handled results of the investigation as he did. But Trump thought Comey was great when his missteps benefitted him, didn't he? Now that it doesn't, he fired Comey.  Obama handled the situation correctly.

He called people marching WITH the KKK, Neo Nazis, and anti-semites (generally, White Supremacists) good people (by reference to them as some sort of virtuous subset).

America went into Iraq in 2003, then Obama launched his 100,000 soldier """"surge"""" into Afghanistan shortly after winning the election in 2008. Obama went on make war against Libya (2011) and then armed and trained the terrorists that drove the Syrian Civil War (2012- )  The USA is currently making war in Iraq and Syria, ostensibly against Islamic State. Then there were numerous drone attacks over the entire period in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. Then add in the threats of war that the US made repeatedly against Iran.  If he gets his own war, Trump will merely be carrying on an American tradition.

True to form, Trump leads with an ancient racial stereotype.   He capped that off with boasting to the Japanese people that ‘it was not pleasant’ for countries that underestimated US military.  140 million deaths by atomic bomb is 'not pleasant'.  I'm sure glad Americans aren't nearly foolish enough to elect someone like Trump.     And:  Trump once said the only thing he liked about the Japanese was they would bow to him.

0,"Let's be clear here. It is very easy to take for granted and ignore things that are bad for  people, our communities, our country, the world.  We tend to turn a blind eye after a while. We excuse them. We say it's not so bad. We deny the impact. Some of Trump's beliefs and actions are harmful and undermining. We need to be vigilant and clear-headed and speak out against, even take action against that which reduces our quality of life and our capacity to thrive. That's hard to do when a leader like Trump is very skilled at using the media, tweets, etc. to avoid taking responsibility or to deny any downside.  Ms Balkissoon is right to alert us to the danger of going unconscious about what is happening, the possible consequences and to encourage us to pay attention and not roll over and play dead. There's too much at stake to be silent, neutral or ostrich-like.  That's not acting in our own best interests.

0,"I'm glad that Trump Jr. changed his story.  His initial account made no sense and was an obvious fabrication.  It was very unlikely that three people from Trump's inner circle would agree to a meeting with a Russian lawyer in the middle of a presidential election campaign without knowing the agenda.  It was equally unlikely that these three miscreants would have any interest in policies relating to the adoption of Russian children (unless perhaps they thought there was an opportunity to sell orphans for a profit).  Trump Jr.'s revised version of events is a bit more plausible, but still doesn't sound like the truth.  Will there be a third version?  Or will Trump Jr. and his buddies stick with this one?

Predictably, the recount, which was based on nothing but wishful thinking,  went nowhere, and there was never any reasonable prospect of making up the difference of tens of thousands of votes per state this way. Now, all of a sudden, the focus is on the Russians. Ironically, some people who now claim to want transparency about the computer hacking, are also unhappy that e-mails from the DNC were made available to the public, showing such things as the cooperation between the Clinton campaign and the DNC against Sanders, for instance. To my knowledge, the accuracy of these e-mails was never disputed, so some Clinton supporters are presumably mad that voters learned the truth before voting. Not to mention that Clinton was never supposed to delete the e-mails in the first place. Blaming the outcome of the election on this is absurd and self-serving.

He also sent an Armored  Brigade to Poland by way of Germany to threaten Putin's future ambitions in Eastern Europe arriving about on Inauguration Day which Trump also must acknowledge and deal with.  Obama had little to no choice on either of those unless he chose to act himself in either location which didn't happen in Syria (remember the 'line' he said not to cross?--it was crossed) or against the Russians or in North Korea during his administration.  A couple of Executive Orders about Russian oligarchs' finances or forbidding them entry to the US as aliens by Obama in the last days of his reign didn't accomplish much.

Trump is doing for America what any good PM should be doing for Canada. Except that our PM ranks Canada secondary, merely a chattel , to the enrichment of his oligarchic friends and the Trudeau Foundation .  With no one of substance other than a former recycled and morally bankrupt PM of another party to negotiate for us, we are looking ill prepared and vulnerable to Trumps distaste for our PM and his bizarre and undiplomatic behaviour . Trudeau isn't bright enough to recognize the deficiencies in his leadership, a myopia founded on arrogance and contempt for political norms of ethical behaviour .  It will not end well

It is America's UNIQUE IMPLEMENTATION of NAFTA that is mostly responsible. Canada and Mexico implementations have caused no major problems. In fact, benefits far out-weight any loss. Same agreement, different outcome.  But is it always in America's political class interest to deny faults that they created. They are the one who passed domestic laws and regulations that implemented NAFTA. They deny responsibility. Blame it on the agreement. So immature, dumb.  The same goes for U.S.-China trade; Trump blames China for everything. Yet there is NO U.S.-China trade agreement. Trade is done on an equal WTO basis.

Their ever-changing & often bazaar demands (typically having a 24-36 hour shelf life) too often focus on domestic audience of the moment appeasement rather than on advancing negotiations.  In this context, Canada's best response is to present relevant US political, industry, labour & consumer interests with the facts about NAFTA's current beneficial impact (& on the enhancement of that impact which moderate updating would provide).  This Canada's negotiating team has been doing well.  Adding our own ill-considered eye-candy to this mix of crazy is exactly what Canada's team needs to avoid doing now.

I mean seriously, the President admits that Libya was his greatest regret after 8 years, and her role in the whole affair barely made the news cycle rounds.  How could a disaster of epic proportions like this be so completely ignored by the mainstream media during the election?  If we're gonna criticize Trump's lack of foreign policy experience, doesn't it make sense that we would also look into Clinton's foreign policy disasters?

But MSNBC and CNN are posting much larger gains than Fox.  Fox's share of the market is shriveling.  And their advertisers are bailing.  First they withdrew from O'Reilly's show, then Hannity's.  It just keeps getting worse for Fox and better for CNN and MSNBC.

0,"Ever electoral system in every modern democracy has its quirks. The electoral college and easy gerrymandering just happen to be the American quirks.  I just so happen to live in one (Canada) of those """"any other country in the world"""" where you figure Hilary would have won because of the popular vote. Our quirks are different--under the right circumstances, a party with 40% of the popular vote can win a majority of the seats in parliament--but the effect is the same. Democratic elections operate under a sets of rules, and the fair and square winner of elections are those who win by those rule.  The essence of a stable democracy is that the winners under the rules that prevail at the time of an election are accepted by the populace as legitimate. The notion that Trump's win, no matter how distasteful, is an any way illegitimate is inherently anti-democratic and thus dangerous.

0,"Cardinal Dolan may be offering a prayer to God to inspire and guide our new president, but will the new president even care? Will he even be paying attention, or will he be tweeting something instead? He hasn't shown much interest in God throughout his entire life. I wonder what makes Cardinal Dolan think he's about to start now? Personally speaking, I think Trump's real god is money and his real religion unfettered market capitalism that is run by the few at the expense of the many. His professed Presbyterian allegiance is there simply to provide some necessary window dressing and appease the culture war contingent who have already served their purpose by helping to get him elected. I doubt they'll be thrown any red meat any time soon, though I'm sure if they're ever needed the red meat will be there at the ready, as it always is with Republican administrations whenever scapegoats are required. With Trump that will probably be sooner rather than later.

Don't blame the bishops for her defeat. She achieved that on her own!

0,"Sorry Bret, Trump won by a landslide  in the only vote that counts.  Perhaps if you took civics you would know that the electoral  college is in the Constitution, to prevent the large states from controlling the election.  Take out California and New York and Trump won the popular vote. Plus in Cal not all absentee votes were counted because it wasn't necessary to the vote outcome.  In the real world you play by the rules, thus Trump didn't campaign in California because he knew he wouldn't get the electoral votes. If he had maybe the outcome would have been different. In the  world of the left its change the rules so we win, even after the contest is over.  And as you say journalist give you the info. Unfortunately its the info to fit their agenda, not the truth. As the majority of the media attacked Trump for saying he wouldn't accept the outcome until he looked at it. the majority of the media support  Hillary doing the same thing.   She lost, so let's change the rules.

0,"I've never understood where Trump got the reputation or idea that he was a good negotiator. Trump's idea of negotiation seems to be to promise the sky and the moon when he needs your co-operation then stiff you once the deal is done. If he doesn't need your co-operation then he tries to strong-arm you. What's worse, Trump thinks of negotiations as zero-sum contests where only he can win. The best negotiations are where everyone leaves happy but Trump only participates in negotiations where he leaves happy.   After getting rid of Obama's negotiations nobody will negotiate with Trump in good faith, because they know any agreement with the USA will only good until the next president comes in. Don't expect any big trade deals while Trump is in power, and even if he does succeed in one don't expect it to go well for the USA.

Maybe its time to be reminded that justice, equality and humanity are the foundations of democracy and of the 'West' and that fanning the flames of fear through division, hatred and mistrust has the power to undo it. In the words of the late former SA Pres. Mandela: """"peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference. Religion, ethnicity, language, social and cultural practices are elements which enrich human civilization, adding to the wealth of our diversity.

0,"QuietAndEffective, The correct answer is that the Ninth Circuit agrees with Hawaii AG Chin that Trump's travel ban violates the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 because it discriminates on the basis of nationality.  Furthermore, the travel ban would be ineffective in reducing terrorism in the U.S. because since 9/11 no immigrant from any of the 6 countries named in the travel ban has killed anyone in a terrorist act.  On the other hand, Trump inspires white supremacists, who have been responsible for deaths resulting from terrorist acts.  Your priorities are misplaced.

That you should ask such a question means you haven't been paying attention, or doing what we all do, only paying attention to what matters to us. Anyway, Trump is bad for democracy because a) he ran a campaign where lying was the strategy to win. It's always been the way, but he openly lies and disregards the truth so it's almost not a lie, just willful denial. People elected him based on this. Bad for democracy, don't  you think?  Shouldn't politicians be elected on the basis of what they're actually going to do? b) Trump played into the already media saturated US electoral cycle, but brought discredit to the press on a whole other level. They used to talk about the press as being the 4th pillar of democracy.  Now he's given Brietbart, the shittest of outlets and disinformation a seat at the power table.

Kennedy would remove offensive nuclear missiles from Turkey and Khruschev would remove his missiles in Cuba.  Khruschev had no motive.  LBJ was a tool of the military-industrial complex as was Nixon and Dulles. Nixon hated the Kennedy's, was jealous of their """"Camelot"""" lifestyle, and sexcapades, and felt cheated that he didn't win the presidency in 1960.  When Nixon was humiliated in 1962 by losing his home state to Pat Brown, he was bitter.  Remember his farewell """"You won't have me to kick around anymore""""?

Despite not being able to 'legally' purchase guns (whatever that means) this fellow acquired an assault rifle to carry out his deranged actions. There are so many illegal guns in the 'best country in the world' that anyone can source a lethal weapon with the right connections and money. Rest assured, this is just another chapter in the ongoing story of American mass murder in a country that considers a portion of its population to be disposable.  Not great news for those of us vacationing in gunland.  In about 10 days or so, Americans will forget about this event just as quickly as they are forgetting about Las Vegas.

This would leave millions of patients who seek services from the organization (2.4 million to be exact) without care.  This fact is completely unimportant to the Republicans.  After all, to them, what’s another few million people without care—especially when Trumpcare will increase the ranks of the uninsured by 22 million?

Trump has been indicted, judged, convicted, and demonized, just hours after having become President.  It just might be the time to sit back and relax and let the man lead.  He might even turn out to be much better leader than expected, not that the rhetoric blown out the backside of this newspaper would ever recognize.

I hope they get the border secured very soon because as we now know most illegals will not be stopping in the US but heading directly for Canada when the weather gets better.  This effort is well organized even to the point where illegals are briefed on what to say and not say to Cdn Border Services agents and immigration officials on arrival.

But it did employ people, did provide service for elite customers, does fit the moral perspective of many Americans.  I don't want my nation to measure all things of value in terms of money/wealth.   Maybe that's my bias, I never wanted or expected great wealth, it has never been my goal.      If I  can't have or don't want something, I'm not going to give it much personal value.    That doesn't make me better than Trump, but it doesn't give my life less values than Trumps either.

I've asked a few of them since and they all said they wanted to assure that Hillary would have an easy win.  But I think Trump may surprise them. I think the mood of this country's voters are such that they will reject an establishment insider Wall Street syphocant like Hillary. People want change and not the change that results in the middle class footing the bill for the indolent and the elite. People may still vote for Trump, but they don't need to. There's a third choice -- reject the two major parties that keep giving us idiots to run the country. I don't love Gary Johnson. The Libertarians could have chosen better. But he will do less harm to the country than either of the two idiots we know so well. And the change libertarianism would bring would perhaps save the country from economic and socio-political ruin.

The outcome of that appeal will depend - in Trump's mind - on whether the high court is run by justices or so-called justices.  He might even wait until his nomination of Gorsuch is ratified by Congress to stack the deck a little in his favour. And while Gorsuch has taken a dim view of Trump's denigration of the judges - calling it 'disheartening and demoralizing' - he is a self-proclaimed originalist. He believes America's quarter-century old constitution should be interpreted literally which, of course, warms the cockles of conservative hearts all over America.

We have been using the """"lesser evil"""" argument for over 40 years; it has a track record we can discuss; and, lesser evil voting has resulted in everything we were trying to avoid. Barack Obama legitimized George Bush's foreign policy simply by being considered """"less evil"""" than Bush. We are still at war. Chaos in Libya and Syria has thrived under Obama policies. Obama's drone strikes create new terrorists everyday, as innocent civilians are murdered by our """"cool"""" president. But, this is all acceptable under a Democrat.

0,"1/3 I totally get what you’re saying. I’m very sympathetic. I’ve been wrestling with this too, and I appreciate the opportunity to express a few thoughts about it. In what follows, I distinguish “delegitimizing” Trump from “normalizing” him. No-one is doing more to delegitimize the Trump presidency than Trump is by way of his immature, irresponsible response to the intelligence assessment of the hacking of the 2016 election by Putin. It appears that Trump thinks this finding jeopardizes his presidency. That perception is more important to him than the truth, the facts or the assault on the United States perpetrated by Putin. But frankly I don’t understand what it would mean to think of Trump as not legitimate. Who or what body would have the authority to declare the election illegitimate? What would happen then? Other than endless lawsuits, of course? I don’t see any way to do the election over; so would it devolve to the House of Representatives? To the Speaker of the House?

He will delegate to professionals, respect the limits in The Constitution for the presidency (unlike Obama), and remind us who we are as a nation. That is what upsets some people.

0,"I agree for the most part but a special prosecutor is wareanted to return credibilty to all the work of the investigation to date, by adding some independence from the DoJ and White House.  This is becuase Trump has kept talking and tweeting material that spread doubt, a sense of interference and even obstruction  of the investigations, whether he did so or not.  His actions to be liked and justify his innocense have backfired.   Irrespective of whether there was any wrong doing, this appointment was necessary for the public to be believe in the investigation and be at peace with the results, allowing Trump to either continue focussing on governing or deal with the consequences of his and/ or is team's actions.

Here's how it's reported on multiple sites:  For tax year 2016, the penalty will rise to 2.5% of your total household adjusted gross income, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, to a maximum of $2,085.  It gets adjusted again in 2017...    Now, to avoid that tax, you get to sign up for Obamacare, which is often subsidized.

Presumably the reasons in the memo Miller wrote track the reasons Trump gave on the day after the firing.

First, visible minorities (or """"brown people"""" as quoted in the article) will not be half the population by 2036, they will be 34.4 percent.    According to the 2010 US census, minority groups combined were 37 percent of the population in the US, meaning that Canada will be roughly as white in 2036 as the US was in 2010.   Donald Trump was still able to get elected with a non-Hispanic white population of around 61 percent.  The author tried to portray Canada's demographic situation as being written in stone and that we all should just grin and bear it.  This is not the case, the country's ethnic change is driven by immigration.  A change in immigration could alter those projections  dramatically. Also, a 7% Muslim population is significant, especially at the local level.  France, according to Pew, is said to be about 7% , and look at the issues they have.

Trump won because globalization isn't working like the model says it should be. It too macro. It's also divorced from social progression, which the lib-seem to miss. Hillary was way to tied to the CIA domination of the world, offering only platitudes to keep the masses placated. She was a fraud for her own ego. At least Trump was honest about his ego. The elite are so divorced from the masses, who cares if he doesnt fully know what he's doing, he's proven compitent instead of being a untrustworthy. If it took this guy, a guy who really didnt need to, to wake up the elite to change the narrative, so be it.  But thought a lot about this article. Its really interesting. The ways of the old giving way to ways of the new. I see it throught the lense that all forms of mass-social control has lessened in power macro wise and a return to fundamentals.

The claim of worship of Snowden is so ridiculous and desperate. Snowden's acts weakened the U.S. and did not expose criminal activity. Where is Snowden now?

Now on the morning of the House vote, Trump and Republican House leaders are frantically still trying to amend it in a way that all sides of their caucus can support. The only possible result of this panic effort will be a bill that, if passed, will be full of unintended bad consequences. The real problem is that any changes that they make to meet the concerns of their Tea Party wing will make the bill far less acceptable to the equally large moderate wing. Many of the latter  are in districts that voted for Clinton in 2016 and are already at risk of losing in 2018 if they backed the original version of the bill.

Wealth is shrinking because more and more countries are trying to redistribute it rather than create it. This is going to make for a much harsher world as everyone fights for their share. In this world, countries like Canada which are weak kneed and which have no real power, are going to get creamed. The Globe should be reporting on this and it is not. It’s looking backwards to the way it would like the world to be, instead of warning us about the train wreck that is coming. This country is going to have to change or it will be done and the current stresses over Bombardier, NAFTA, feuding provinces, etc are just the leading edge.

As always American security people think about security from an American perspective.  It is completely obvious in hindsight that cockpit doors should have been secured and never opened regardless of what happens in the cabin.  But American security folk could not comprehend the suicide aspect.  Even today, bomb prevention in luggage is predicated on the notion that passengers will not kill themselves to bring a plane down.  Anyone with minimal skill could put an undetectable bomb in their luggage and bring a plane down but they would go down too.  Smart security combined with smart border access (what Trump is trying to do) would lock out opportunities for terrorists and make it possible to leave Afghanistan and the rest of the middle east knowing we would be safe.  Those opposing immigration/border control, force US forces to stay in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Mideast.

It used to be you had to fit all your stories in so many pages of a paper, or so many minutes of daily programming.  Now it's all free and online.  The work to get it done can be crowd sourced. Hawai'i 's going to mail in elections so more people will have time to look up info on the candidates online over a period of time before they have to send their ballot in.  More voices is what Civil Beat is about and what democracy is about.  Lots of people may discount Mike Powers, but a lot of people discounted Donald Trump and he is now dominating the news cycle, getting millions of votes, and minimally is a call to all who will listen that much of the population are not happy with the status quo.  So excluding Powers and many others is limiting in a consequential way.  And the tv folks rake in beau coup bucks from election advertising, so they zero excuse not to cover everyone

"
0,"M,  Forget """"protest"""" voting.  If one thinks Trump or Clinton is the best candidate (define best however one wants), that person is who one should vote for.  But if one doesn't and one thinks a third party candidate is the best candidate then that is who one should vote for, regardless of what state or territory they are in.  The only way a third party becomes a serious alternative is by folks voting for them and continually voting for them.  There is no magic to creating  a third party.  It takes commitment, money, organization, hard work, and lots of people.  A true mission impossible is thinking the two parties will want and allow the current voting system to change.  Why would they?  The rules are stacked in their favor.  That, they will show bipartisanship on every time.

These Russia hearings that are gumming up Washington are preventing Trump from doing presidential business. He's created 1,300 coal jobs and has a purchase order from the Saudis for $115 billion for weapons. The super rich are getting richer and the middle class and the impoverished will suffer the most.

You should be happy that our president-elect is showing some signs of compromise. Our country desperately needs compromise from both the major parties. Instead your throwing the very temper tantrum you accuse Republicans of doing 8 years ago. You should be ashamed.  Obama and Clinton have shown nothing but class conceding to Trump.

So far, the previous attempts to quell the opioid crisis has been trading one drug (opioids) with another (suboxone, methadone, and other buprenorphine based drugs). It is not working. What this nation needs is to treat the underlying causes of why people turn to opioids. This battle can be won by providing extensive emotional and mental healthcare for those addicted to opioids.

The political process has been with us since the ancient Greeks created the concept of a democracy.  Politics means building coalitions and relationships within your party and outside your party to get the support you need to accomplish your agenda.  Trump quite frankly has done nothing to build those coalitions or relationships and instead has done the opposite and created friction and obstacles.  People will not blindly give Trump support, he will have to earn their trust to get that support.  Keep in mind that his approval rating is in the mid-30% so he has a lot of trust building to do.

I am not a Trump fan but you are another example of  what he was saying  in his letter.

For such a dangerous individual such dismissiveness is dangerous in and of itself, and presents a false equivalence between the two parties. Nonetheless, I'm glad you're voting for Hillary.  I can understand your desire to vote for someone who more nearly mirrors your own feelings about abortion, but it seems to me that has to be weighed against the Republicans' platform, which in so many ways is very much """"anti-life"""" for all but the most affluent in this country. What about their record of war as a first resort, or their love for the death penalty? Then there's the danger Trump represents to the world at large. Any person who cares about the future of life on earth has to be concerned about that.  Elections are always about choosing the lesser of two evils. This year it's particularly easy.

0,"AncasterMike: Point taken, and I suppose that's what Mr. Trumps supporters believe as well. I think real inflation adjusted household income has hardly changed in the U.S. for a very long time. I think some of the same sentiment existed in the U.K. and resulted in the U.K. Brexit vote. Just as some of the extreme elements in the 20's and 30's focused on just a few issues (Versailles, Jews, Communists), Mr. Trump told Americans that their troubles were illegal immigrants and terrible trade treaties. Just yesterday we saw the emergence of the AFD in Germany, while not greatly significant, significant just the same. As the pendulum swings in Europe and North America, we'll see how far it goes.

0,"Yes— there are several possible violations involving theft or or conspiracy involving the stolen emails the Russians had and were offering to the US. The big violation involves lying to the FBI regarding when and how the Russians offered emails stolen from HIllary/DNA and damaging information on Hillary. Papadopoulos got caught and he has now offered sworn statement of facts to a judge to be granted his deal with the FBI (in addition, there is other evidence from Popadopoulous some of which could have come after his arrest from recorded conversations with others). These facts can identify and contradict others like Trump Jr. who was also offered dirt on Hillary. More violations regarding conspiracies and collusion will come from facts arrived at through questioning Popadopoulus and others. It will also catch Trump in obstruction if he has made denials or false statements.

Fox News, with their slate of celebrities pushes the other choice, along with the likes of Rush and Ann Coulter, proclaimed """"journalists"""".  Perhaps one fault is that national network news reporters assume the status of celebrity, which is wrong. They are just supposed to investigate and report what others are doing and what events are occurring. The focus should never be on them. It really turns me off when I see Megan Kelly as a guest on late night talk shows. I get really disgusted when she starts making news with her idiotic swipes at people like Trump and her issues with her bosses. Who cares??!!  I agree with Kevin that most journalists are sincere, hard-working, dedicated people. It's a few that climb to the high echelons of being in millions of people's faces each day that seem to go astray.

There's a famous picture of Dick Cheney shaking hands with Hussein, after delivering the poison gas!  The US has also supplied WMD's to most of the countries surrounding Iran (billions of dollars worth every year). They have worked tirelessly to destroy Iran since the 1950's, after the democratically elected Iranian leader nationalised the oil, that the the British and Americans were stealing. The US imposed a brutal dictator on the people there, who for decades terrorized the majority of the population.  Iran is no threat to the US and has invaded no one for over 200 years. It was also one of humanities greatest centres of art and culture. The US is the villain here, by any rational analysis of the situation.

One quietly spoken, as in fearful and worrisome, conclusion is that he is both a symptom and result in the decades long journey of removing the education of our citizens from State control to Federal control. Why this trasfer of control?,… to provide a workforce for what is known as NWO…or New World Order.

0,"Couldn't you come up with a better headline.  This headline sort of indicates that Trump somehow got involved personally in the Emmy Awards instead of being the brunt of jokes.
"
0,"Trump won't make those donations once he gets the PR for them, unless the press hounds him. I'm from New York, and I can tell you stories about him. Here's just one. Trump was known for crashing big society benefits without paying for a ticket. Bluster his way in, because... he's The Donald. At some point he'd walk up onto the dais or the head table and seat himself wherever there was still an empty chair. As soon as he was photographed there for Page Six, the New York Observer, or Black Tie magazine, he would step down and make a french exit, on his way to the next one. No one in New York could stand him. Only the hicks who voted for him think he's a revered figure in high society there.
"
0,"This is disgusting stuff. Trump is causing an existential crisis for billions of people.  That crisis is of no interest for the stock market crowd.  The only question for them is whether there is a buck in it.  Healing drugs,  hanging rope, or crematoriums. It's all just investment opportunities.

0,"Last year Forbes did their yearly list of the richest people .  While Trump maintains his brand name makes things worth more ( which it does ) and feels his worth is at around 7 to 10 Billion , Forbes thinks it's closer to 4 or 5 Billion.   I don't know about you but when I travel I often see Trump buildings .  For a person to be worth even 1 Billion says something about their ability to get things done.   If he can do for America just half what he has done for himself ,  America will become great again.   Every attorney worth a nickel would tell their client not to show their tax returns while under audit .  Trump would be dumb to do it.  Democrats think once they see them it will show pay-offs and kick-backs .  Like every smart person lists them.   Maybe the owner of the Dispatch should show everyone hers so we can understand why the paper is so slanted.
"
0,"The plea reflects that he made a serious mistake but voluntarily turned himself in. He could have avoided making immigrants look bad if he had not initially fled. His case is the reason why we should not allow illegal immigrants from getting drivers licenses. It is the bad apple who ruins everything for the majority of people. The fact is most immigrants are decent human beings and the government has failed to setup a reasonable immigration system with Latin America and Canada. Trump's solution is no solution. It does not reflect Christian values. It is a reflection of his racist rhetoric for trolling for votes. The Democrats don't have a solution either. Obama could have pardoned many of them, but the Democrats would rather seek to exploit the situation for votes.
"
0,"Lets not assign omnipotence to The Mop and Pail.  It remains Canada's most influential newspaper (perhaps Canada's only influential newspaper internationally) but papers no longer have the influence on the public and therefore on the politicians that they used to have.  What is far more likely to drive our country into a huge depression is the reckless spending of Justin and The Butts Kissers who seem to be on a determined quest to run the national debt up to $1.5 TRILLION by 2045, thereby enabling Little Potato to pass his papa Big Potato in ruining the fiscal position of the country, hobbling the economy, forcing program cuts just to service the exploding debt and saddling future generations with crippling debt payments.  But The Globe would do well to do what Wente suggests for everyone which is to take a deep breath, not panic or assume the apocalypse, and understand that Trump might ultimately work out to be a good president.
"
0,"""""Many of the counterprotesters were clad in black and masked...""""  This sounds very similar to those at the Trump rallies who attacked Trump supporters and destroyed property.

Yes the Energy Dept, whose mission is to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. .  In a questionare distributed with 74 questions, not one question is about the Dept of Energy's management of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. .   The Trump team doesn't even know what the Dept of Energy does,  …but they're on a hunt to find out if any Energy Dept people ever attended any lnteragency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon meetings. . Yes the Energy Dept, whose mission is to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.  .

0,"I don't like Trump and I'm very far from being a progressive. Trump is not a conservative. He is himself about as progressive and expansionist as you can get. It doesn't matter whether you vote for Hillary or Donald; you're electing a dictator, which is all progressives really are.

Blumenthal's words about his meeting with Gorsuch is corroborated.  It's kind of the nice thing about not trying to keep all the information to yourself because that means your words can be verified by indepedent uninterested sources.  But I doubt Trump could understand that as he doesn't understand the value of truth.  Probably because he spent far too long running from it like rarely using emails because they can be used against you in court.
"
0,"Mueller isn't credible. This arrest, and especially the LEAKING of this arrest last Friday really shows the desperation of this investigation. He was hired to investigate COLLUSION by TRUMP with RUSSIA. Not some collusion by manafort in 2008 with the Dems.  I mean, good for Mueller making an arrest at all, but it seemed more engineered to save his own skin than anything else. Mueller was desperate to show he was finding something, anything.

1,"The monumental hypocrisy of this post rises to the level of mental illness. While people suffered from this disaster, Trump was in a Twitter war about football players, for purely political purposes. The jerk-in-chief sold himself as the can-do big shot executive who could accomplish what mere mortals can't. Instead, he's a fraud, fixated on his own belly button, or a few inches lower.

"
0,"Yes, but the USA is a real country, and what happens in the USA has real consequences - especially for Canadians.  Canadian elections, governments, and 'democracy"""" is more akin to say, student council - they have a say into what band will be playing at the dance on Friday night, or what what order the cheer will be at a high school athletic event, but bot much more beyond that...and certainly no influence beyond the school grounds.  Want more proof?  Articles on US politics generate at least 4x (just a guess) as many posts as any Canadian article.  Trump sneezes,  400+ posts.  Trudeau says income taxes will immediately double? - 35-40 posts..  Look at the whole China pay for access issue - a real snooze fest, yet there is more solid evidence there than Trump-Russia (which i still think is likely) of foreign influence, and Canadians don't care...  Anbang was scared out of Kushner/NY, yet allowed to buy in BC. Totally corrupt.

0,"As a State Representative, Lisa Murkowski was a pro-choice moderate.   Moderate voters re-elected her to the US Senate by write-in when she needed our help.  Once elected, she promptly ditched the moderates and  embraced everything ALEC and Koch.   In so doing, Lisa rejected  the voters that got her elected.  A climate denier from the Arctic is oxymoronic and IMHO reflects her Senate reality more than  core belief.  At heart, I think she is still a moderate, pro-women Senator, horrified by our country's radical move to oligarchy.  As one of the few heartfelt  moderates in the Senate, she could be one of the most powerful people on the planet.  As few as 3-4 GOP Senators flip flopping could completely stop the radical right agenda of Trump.  Natives put her in office.  Is """"Lockstep Lisa"""" really going to vote for a racist Attorney General?   All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good women do nothing.  Call her.  Write her.  Email her.

He has so isolated the US that it is doubtful anybody other than despotic leaders will follow his wish.  US allies should continue with the previously agreed strategy of upping their defence spending to 2% by 2024 and make sure not to steer any of the spend towards the US.  If the money has to be spent then it might as well be spent creating employment for your own citizens.  Americans will have to find other ways to attract manufacturing employment.

0,"The problem with the Iraq comparison is that the US was hell bent on attacking Iraq and was looking to manufacture a pretext. That's not the case here.  Perhaps more dangerously, the US strike shows the unpredictability of the Trump administration; a week ago, senior administration officials, and the President himself, were essentially saying that Assad wasn't their problem and that it was up to the Syrian people to work out what happens (yeah right!). Understandably, the Assad regime understood those comments to mean that they had a free hand to do what they would. That's why the gas attack happened.  I'm sure nobody was as surprised as Assad by the about face and, even though the attack was largely theatre, the Assad regime and the Russians must be wondering what's next. I expect the message from the attack is meant to communicate to the Assad regime that it is free to exterminate Syrians using conventional means but that it must refrain from using chemical weapons.

0,"What happens if Trump calls on Canada to abide by its NoRAD and NATO commitments?

Our defence budget was 20.3billion in 2016 which amounts to 0.99% of GDP and we are ranked 23rd out of 28 NATO members...so if trump calls our bluff and demands we contribute our yearly budget could increase by 40 billion just foe the military!!!

1,"Among the wealthy elites in China, family, business and politics are all deeply intertwined. Every branch of the Communist Party, every province and city often operate as a fiefdom for those in power, allowing leaders special, lucrative access to policy, land and government contracts. There is even a name for second-generation sons and daughters of wealthy business executives and government officials — such as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner — who have access to power through family ties. They are called “fuerdai.” . “It’s incredibly stupid and highly inappropriate,” said Richard Painter, the former chief White House ethics lawyer in President George W. Bush’s administration, who has become a vocal critic of the Trump administration. “They clearly imply that the Kushners are going to make sure you get your visa. . . .

He has shown his true colours to the world many many times, but unfortunately most Trumpeteers seem to need an urgent appointment with their respective optometrists and audiologists to deal with their chronic cases of selective eyesight and selective hearing when it comes to Trump's actions.

1,"Donald Trump is spending this morning of his vacation lamenting the removal of various monuments to treason in defense of slavery: One thing I’ve been surprised by during this slow motion car crash into a raging dumpster fire is the sheer depth of Trump’s stupidity and ignorance. You could tell during Tuesday’s press conference that he thought he had come up with a new and especially powerful argument when he lectured the reporters about the previously unappreciated fact — no doubt just relayed to him by an advisor in the previous day or two — that Washington and Jefferson owned slaves (wait until he finds out that Jefferson liked to rape some of his). On top of everything else, he’s just really really dumb — and of course he remains blissfully unaware of this.

This thing about """"don't discriminate based on creed"""" looks good but it is false when talking about the Travel Ban EO which has nothing to do with religion. It is understandable why those who consider the EO as based on religion have been brainwashed by the media. For the media earns the trust of the people for broadcasting legitimate news. Except that it also broadcasts fake news and engages in obsessive anti-Trump propanda which brainwashes its listeners against Trump, brainwashes because legitmate news cloaks fake news and  propaganda as legitimate.

Hillary has the support of radically progressive people and Democrats are smart enough not to eat each other alive publicly.

Their loyalty is to their belief and sometimes principles which overrides their loyalty to party.  If Hillary gets elected the Democrats will give her their full support and even change rules to get her policies through Congress.  If Trump gets elected, even the Republicans can't stand him so Trump will actually pull the two parties together to stop him when he goes over the top.

Maybe even a major overhaul of the political system so that a president can't wield such unassailable executive power. One of the keys to the success of America has been the English language. Despite its oddities, it's fairly easy to learn which has aided its spread and thus U.S. global influence. China is going to have trouble trying to get Mandarin widely used. That is going to restrict its influence. BTW the above photo of American troops looks like it was taken in the U.S. Mid-West, not France. Note the snow beside the road. Americans didn't start action in France until late Spring/early summer of 1918.

0,"The corporate tax cut is straightforward and people understand what it is and what it is aimed at. It is to return over a $ Trillion in cash horded overseas by a handful of US Corporations. I read final draft of what investment analysts are saying about the impact of the cut. One conclusion is that Trump is right that the corporate rate needs to be lowered to 15% and even lower because of the tax reduction devices corporations now use to lower corporate tax to 15% plus the return on the cash that comes from share value and favorable credit that lets corporations “access” the value of those funds tax free through stock appreciation and super low cost borrowing. The other conclusion is that if the funds were enticed back to the US,  when  looking at returns on investment, investing in plants and hiring in the US will have a short term negative return plus risk vs keeping overseas production. Higher returns come from buying back shares with small sustainable dividends to shareholders

""""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,"""" proclaims the Declaration of Independence.  Our country was born out of protest against injustice, and AG Chin carries that legacy forward.  President Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that oppose him on a related issue, so the loss of federal funds may be a concern for states that decide to oppose the President.  However, upholding the principle of equality transcends monetary interests.  In opposing any unconstitutional executive order, AG Chin is declaring that Hawaii can't be bought.  Hawaii's residents who stand for the principles on which our country was founded should stand with AG Doug Chin.

A crop failure in one place can be alleviated  by food distribution from another.  All famines are political, happening when food is actually withheld from those who need it. The Irish Potato famine, the Ukraine famine, Bangladesh were all man made disasters. This is no different. So what are all the liberals and socialists going to do about all of these disasters in failed Islamic states? What are all these big hearted liberals going to do to actually solve this famine? Absolute nothing, except blame Trump for doing nothing, or doing too much, or doing the wrong thing or doing it at the wrong time. Trump wants to stop the reason suffer and is hated for it.

You can't even talk politics with most liberals. Like a brick wall, they don't listen. They might insult you or worse, and they're seldom able think ahead to the consequences of their beloved liberal policies or any flaws in their chosen candidates. Their vocabulary is limited to """"racist, homophobic, greedy wealthy capitalists,"""" etc. Consequently, many Trump supporters refused to tell them or pollsters their choice. Since more Democrats than Republicans were polled, deliberately, the polls failed. Truth failed.

Now how great a pastor, preacher, leader, teacher, confessor, etc will be what a priest is valued for and those priests weak in these talents and spiritual skills will start to appear as the weak priests that they are and get pushed aside.  Also women priests mean women bishops, cardinals and popes, real equality, so no one group of automatically lesser humans - to tell yourself - Well, at least I will always be more important than those people.  This could equally apply if we were to decide we don't need any black male priests or Hispanic priests.

As always, he places his own needs -- in this case, the need to be seen as having been legitimately elected -- above all else. To hell with national security, as long as his ego doesn't get bruised.  We've had arrogant presidents before, God knows. We've also had self-centered presidents, presidents who couldn't control their tempers, dangerously stubborn presidents, and presidents with serious deficiencies in diplomacy and administration. But I can't recall ever, in the history of this nation, a president with such a complete combination of those qualities.  Buckle up.

We can expect that will be sometime within Trump's first term. So there should be a sense of urgency to any diplomacy while more drastic options are considered.

Yet when the time came for them to present a plan they did so in an order that the plan would be far worse than the disaster that they call Obamacare.  Then after revealing it they tweaked it again and made it even worse than their original plan.  The fact is that the GOP just wants to get rid of Obamacare, because it was made and passed into law by a Democrat.  It took 13 months to come up with Obamacare while the GOP rushed a plan in that would harm the poor, sick etc.  The GOP cares nothing about the poor, sick nor the middle class.  Their agenda is to deregulate as much as possible while passing the tax breaks off to the rich and big corporations.  Trump is a joke with ties to Russia and should be impeached.

0,"Aside from the environmental degradation that results from mining coal and burning it for power production, Trump's insistence on reviving the coal industry by repealing environmental rules and regs doesn't make any sense economically. Coal is more expensive than natural gas, even without regulations. For many years utilities have been switching from coal to natural gas and that trend is only accelerating with the advent of fracking, which opened up more NG reservoirs and drove the already cheap price down further.  Coal doesn't have a future as an export either, since it's still competing with liquified natural gas (LNG). In other words, Trump is pandering to coal producing states solely to curry favor with, and get the votes of, those who work in the industry, even though he can't actually fulfill his campaign promise of bringing back jobs. Coal is dying and he can't bring it back.

0,"Good rant but people seem to be so blinded by hate they just can't think rationally. First it was said Trump got into politics to enrich himself. Actually he said he got into politics to drain the swamp and if he got into politics to enrich himself he is doing a poor job. According to Forbes he has lost 600 million since becoming president. I believe she meant the Clintons or Trudeau who's foundations have made them extremely wealthy. Second... few republicans of principle. Seriously.  You are entitled to your own opinion not your own facts. Just seem people only focus on the white noise not substance. His economic policies are sound and will promote prosperity if given a chance. Also the best market performance of a first year president since FDR in 1945 but all anyone focuses on are the things that don't really matter.

(from:  http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/21/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-popular-vote-final-count/ ) A watched election with checks and balances on who participates, and all citizens have the opportunity to participate, is the only poll that has any true merit in my opinion.

Both Presidents Jack Kennedy and Bill Clinton were known womanizers - both had long history of doing so  Kennedy had his lovers escorted into the White House late at night while Clinton had a young woman intern give him oral sex right in the Oval office  ONLY difference was that Kennedy and Clinton were Democrats while Trump is a Republican  At the core of the protest is that Trump won the 2016 election in KEY states and the Democrats could not get their vote out in the KEY states  Moore, Garry R - Solutions Inc

The executive order is one of the least constitutional actions that can be taken by a President and preparing hundreds of them months before taking office does not give me good feelings about the direction this administration is looking to go.  Besides, Trump will have all of the political backing he needs with both a house and senate of red to push bills through. Of course, that would require him working with the GOP.  I suppose we will see what happens.

0,"Canada should speak to Trump personally, not just his transition team. Canada and the US are on a level playing field. Mexico pays its workers $8 an hour, sucking all manufacturing south. That's not at all the case with Canada, where wages are comparable with the US. Trump seems very accessible to those leaders calling by phone,, and visiting Trump Tower in New York. He doesn't bother to follow State Dept protocol. Justin Trudeau should take advantage of this easy access to  get on the phone NOW and speak to Trump directly. He must ensure that Trump's guns blazing transition team doesn't send a stray bullet in the direction of Canada, over an issue Trump may not even be aware of. Canada is an afterthought in the constellation of foreign policy issues. Trudeau himself, must take the initiative.

I don't have those answers, but we have several folks on site that know more about the lumber industry than I do (it wouldn't take much!).  Our own fed subsidizes those who extract minerals/oil/gas  on public property.  It helps livestock ownership  that feed on public landes.  Canada and other nations will be pointing out our own subsidies in the very near future.     I don't think a trade war will bother Pres. Trump.    He's not afraid of confrontation and likely believes that the nation will gain advantage in such a conflict.     It's a theory.  I hope he's right

0,"Even Jill Stein, who has extremely marginal experience in governance, has more than Trump. Johnson and Weld have considerable.  That granted, Johnson's notion that the market will magically fix our healthcare problems flies in the face of more than a century of experience. Capitalism rewards industry consolidation. It's the enemy of competition. Right now, AETNA is threatening to pull out of expanding into five new states and five more where it currently participates in the market, if the government refuses to allow it to purchase Humana.  Our only successes in the U.S. have been the funding of the Veterans Administration, Medicaid and Medicare. The Republicans have done their best to destroy the latter, with felons Denny Hastert and Tom DeLay threatening retaliation if fiscal conservatives refused to capitulate to their unfunded subsidies of their pharmaceutical and insurance industries contributors in their 2003 Medicaid """"Modernization"""" and Prescription Drug """"Improvement"""" Act.

0,"Lets face it there are people that will never be pleased no matter what Trump does.  I admit I am the same about Trudeau.

0,"I commend the Kenai assembly for their mostly apparent unbiased approach to government. Take the words “luciferian” and “satan” out and Ms. Fontana is simply saying; don’t stop learning, don’t be afraid of change, oppose big government, don’t be too stubborn, and call BS when you hear it. The message sounds reasonable for representatives in government. Implicit bias, in this case religious, categorizes people as good or bad before the message is read. Atheists have been caught in this spillover and developed their own biases. These biases are apparent in the reaction of various assembly participants and commentators. Understandable given a cultural milieu that constantly reinforces religious prejudices. However, overcoming bias is key to making progress in an interdependent society. Objective thinking trumps bias. Hopefully, this is an opportunity to practice.
"
0,"I would agree, as it ranks up there with the procedural shananigans of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. Fortunately, the House Republican leadership of Speaker Ryan, Mr. McCarthy and a tweet from Mr. Trump ended the foolishness, but they will need to think clearly about how to balance the important purpose of the OCE against those who would turn it into a political weapon or render it useless.
"
0,"what Trump should do with Mexico is something similar to the old AUTOPACT it had with Canada. For every car Mexico wants to export to America duty free, they must import/ sell one in Mexico. This would force them to let the benefits of trade filter down to the people and create a middle class rather than the corrupt 10% pocketing all the benefits. They can do the same with most other manufactured goods.

0,"Correction respectfully Q HALL, I don't think Mr. Trump is a racist today, no more than Muhammed Ali who advocated racial separation early in his life was in his later years, no more than Elderidge Cleaver was as a Black Activist who later joined the Mormon Church after spending his youth boasting about rape of white women, even George Wallace who you pointed out apologize in his later years. When You bring up the 1960's, again it was a very different era, racism was to be both Black and White people, just as we are now seeing today. Mr. Trump never endorsed David Duke, many who were racists supported Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump made quite clear he rebuked them. One can't stop people from supporting them, but unlike the historical Democratic Party, which was the party of the KKK, the one that vigorously fought to preserve slavery in America, if you respectfully wish to """"deflect"""" to history to validate you point, please include all of that history!

There is no one that can control that, today he offended the Vet's groups by saying that those in a war who get PTSD are weak. The Vets have fought for decades to fight prejudice that people have towards those who get PTSD and are considered """"weak"""" and Trump just re-enforced that stereotype.

This was not exclusivity a US move at the 14 member Security Council of the UN and this is NOT an unexpected statement against Israeli settlements from the rest of the word; it's what has been being said for generations but the US sheltered Israel from reality.

Still, Hillary is Hillary and as such can not be voted for. But not voting for trump is still half a vote in her favor.

0,"I agree it is the republicans but why it is their fault is where we differ. When they had the vote to repeal ACA they voted for but under the conditions they knew it wouldn't become law. It is the same tactic that they did with the Patriot Act. Majority of people didn't want it, Obama ran on repealing it and what happened, the Obama presidency strengthened it. Well the Republicans tried the same tactic and now both parties are trying to figure out why it didn't work. The reason is they got over confident. Because over the past 100 years the same tactic has been used but they didn't count on the American public and a few good politicians standing in their way. I believe they figured they could come up with any law and claim it repealed the ACA and the public would just follow like sheep. Well they were proven wrong just as the Democrats are being proven wrong the way they have been pushing their agenda for so long. An informed public has awoken and I think it is because most hate trump.

Similarly, just because someone is in business or studying, does not mean that he or she does not have bad intentions.

These issues were faced by Our Lord, Himself and He never pronounced upon them. Everyone is equal in the eyes of God. How that effects them in real life depends upon how they find themselves.  The opportunity for the persecuted, the prisoners, the slaves to gain eternal salvation were at least equal if not   those who were freemen. Is that not what we can all hope for? Does it really matter whether we are slave or free in this life?

0,"Your logic makes no sense.  Trudeau is doing the only thing that is feasible and that is to position Canada to react quickly and firmly to whatever Trump throws at us.  The rest of the world is also taking the position of wait and see what the man-child Trump decides to do.  Even Trump is not able to elaborate his policies beyond soundbites expressed in 140 characters or less.  Yet, you think Trudeau is missing """"real plans"""" whatever that means.  He has a plan (read the article again) and he has acted on it quickly.  It is telling that the UK foreign minister suddenly had to fly off to NYC last week to meet Trump's team after he heard that the Canadian delegation had done exactly that.  Boris Johnson was caught with his pants down because Trudeau was one big step ahead of him.  I support Trudeau in his efforts to date.  Keep up the good work.  (Bring on the Harperites!!!)

0,"40-20:  As usual, you suggest confronting bigotry is, itself, bigotry.  That's a very tired and ineffective ploy.  It would be impossible to not see the racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, and elitism Trump displays each day.  Google """"Trump and (any of those bigoted attitudes)"""" and you will get tens of thousands of hits.....most with videos of him making comments representing his bigotry.  We are a nation of values and, while there are individuals like you who share Trump's world view and biases, I'm optomistic enough to believe you folks do not represent """"America's"""" values.  We're a pluralistic society and, within established laws and Constitutional protections,  The Donald and """"friends"""" are free to hold and express those bigoted views.  However, expressing his disdain for those values, as does Mr. Roberts, does not make him a bigot as well.  It simply shows he has the courage to confront the hatred and arrogance which, in my opinion, so characterizes Trump.

There have been far more jobs lost to automation than exported abroad.

So where will the extra jobs come from? Even burger flipping will soon be one by robots.

Personally, I don't expect that anything will be found that is technically illegal...technically. I think all we'll be left with is a web of connections and meetings that smells like someone's wearing way to much cheap Novaya Zarya in a sauna. Eyes will water, everyone will be holding their noses and choking on it, but no charges will be laid.  However, that stench will linger and will taint minority-elect President Trump's presidency as surely as the fact that a majority of American voters voted for Hillary Clinton. It will rankle. It will be a constant reminder that technical legitimacy does not translate into even the faintest semblance of leadership and moral authority.  OTOH, who knows? It's on-going.

Did you realize that the UK has by far the biggest defense budget in Europe? Without the UK's defense capabilities, the Eastern European countries would be in a very weak position. This is particularly true with Trump in office in the US. Defense will be a part of the negotiations.  C. Scotland separation?? Did you know that Scotland trades far more with the rest of the UK than they do with the EU? Leaving the UK, after Brexit, would be economic suicide for Scotland.

Instead of restrictions of the Paris Climate Accord, Mr. Trump initiated  a effort to free Poland from dependence on Russian energy supplies and thus having to acquiesce to Russian political demands. Mr. Trump's lack of a Nobel Peace Prize and his failure to get emotional for the kumbaya Paris Climate Accord has the AGW proponents in a tizzy. Trump  doesn't blame America and promotes the ideas, policies, and programs of Western civilization that lifted the World out of the Dark Ages and poverty. His detractors in the Democratic party and the political left pontificate warnings with racist, insensitive characterizations, but every card carrying Democrat has a legacy of slavery and segregation while utopian, Godless, Socialist/Communist cadres imprisoned, enslaved, and murdered hundreds of millions during the 20th Century. Trump will not hide the lights of Western civilization under a basket.

You see, the fact that someone would even write an article on this and think that the majority of Americans would care just goes to show how way off kilter the MSM and others are to think that a person trying to make a living in a place where they used to have a good union job that got outsourced would really care.  This was the problem with Mr. Obama - he was a celebrity president.  His job was to have celebrities to the White House.  This was HRC - having entertainers open up for her to attract crowds that would leave.  Look, I get it that the liberal elite thinks that having A-listers is important.  But people who live in regular towns in regular homes doing regular jobs don't really care; they just want their president to get to work and create jobs and to make America great again.  If Trump does that, then most couldn't give a hoot if it is an A, B, C or Z-list celebrity at the inauguration.

I seriously doubt he'd know the laws pertaining to his office if he were elected POTUS---which would make the steady erosion of checks on the Executive under both Bush and Obama a dangerous trend indeed.  Hillary Clinton is both knowledgeable and experienced, having devoted her life to public service.  Republicans hate her and her husband for being better republicans than they are, and savvier politicians.  It's also about time for a woman to be president, and under the current metric, Clinton is by far the most qualified candidate to run for office in a long time.  That said, she is also firmly part of a shift to the right in American politics which has been going on since before Reagan, engineered by her sponsors on Wall St.:  The Dems have thunderously abandoned working people and progressives in the process, and many of them have gone over into crazy land with Trump---They have only themselves to blame for it

0,"I have looked at the """"appropriation"""" controversy with an increasingly uneasy feeling about its ultimate outcome. You would think that what the Walrus would want is the best, most competent, most visionary person for the job. But we are told that the most politically correct candidate wouldn't be a man and wouldn't be white, and maybe wouldn't be straight. What that will mean is that losing white, male, straight candidates can with justice feel the game was rigged against them. Can, with justice, feel that same rigging will likely be going on in other areas as well. I would suggest that if there is something that you absolutely don't want to copy from the U.S., it is a public policy which says that all straight white men have been over-privileged and accordingly should today experience discrimination and prejudice in the workplace. It is an approach which if adopted will lead to - as it has in Trump's America - something which might be called revenge politics.

It's McMaster at NSC (thank God they got Bannon out of there) and the Joint Chiefs who provide current military policy advice. The first thing they would have asked is what is the effect or end-state to be achieved? Was probably met with resounding silence from the oval office and an order to just hit something. It gave the buffoon's dismal polling numbers a bump. If you think Mattis is simple, one-dimensional or uneducated, I'd suggest a little more review before commenting. Not sure why you take issue with bombs in Afghanistan, we dropped plenty of ordnance there ourselves.

Especially in Hawaii where locals and holes connect on the left around environmental and cultural issues.  The unions are losing grace, credibility, membership and participation levels.  I see them not working during campaign season.  Last cycle the unions put an attack add out on a council member, listing all the unions and business organizations against her.  I thought it was a really powerful add, but the council member she still won like naaaaden.

Like a pit bull on a leash, Kim can be reined in or given his head in a balancing act orchestrated by Xi.  It allows China to enjoy the best of all worlds. It can reap the rewards of a lopsided trade relationship with the West while matching American hegemony with its own in Southeast Asia. Its long term strategy, of course, is to displace the US as the region's policeman. The ineptness of the Trump administration is accelerating that process.  With hawks and doves perched on either of Trump's shoulders, no doubt he's getting sharply contrasting advice. While all options might be on the table, the smart money is on tougher economic sanctions. And yet, with an unstable, unpopular Trump and an unstable Kim, military engagement can't be excluded.

The various NAZI parties number in the millions and commit hate crimes from defacement of black churches, synagogues and mosques, up to assaults and murders. There is no comparison. The worst thing the NBPP has done is supposed voter intimidation, that turned out to be completely overblown.

Jesse Jackson and President Carter come to mind as private citizens who have volunteered to help American interest.    I'm sure Flynn felt he was doing the same.  The point of contention for me is not Flynn's transgression, it's trying to discern the intent of the Trump administration and how they plan on interacting with Russia in the future.   It seems pretty clear that they promised, through Flynn, that the Obama sanctions would be eased under a Trump administration.  Linked or not, it makes their release of information against Clinton appear to be politically motivated.  I have a big problem with that.    It must be investigated.  We need to know if that was done with American partners.

0,"Trump Has No Good Reason to Scrap the Iran Deal The reasons his administration has put forth are dishonest, as to be expected, …and, most importantly, will make us less secure. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which the deal gave extensive rights to inspect Iran’s facilities, has concluded repeatedly that the Iranians are in compliance. Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Iran is not in breach of the agreement. Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iran is in compliance with the agreement. No one says Iran is not in compliance, but Trump, not one of our allies, no one. No one but Trump. Trump says Iran is not in compliance because a treaty that works was put forth under a black president. That's the only reason Trump will heedlessly take a flyer at destabilizing the Middle East.

Yet, it may be Trump does not think he is lying. By the intent criteria. there is no willful """"misrepresentation of the truth"""" (my preferred term). He is not lying. A person who in effect believes their lies is deluded. When they claim conspiracies of millions as a reason for contrary evidence, this may be a delusional disorder.

0,"If Trudeau had followed the course advocated in this article, what would Leah expect this would have achieved?  Change the positions of Trump and his supporters? Hardly likely.  Make it easier for people within the US to give effective voice and practice to the views expressed by Trudeau? Hardly likely? At best, supporters of those views would only be able to carry on as before and not be unduly burdened by the need to justify the Canadian intrusion into US domestic politics.  Make it more difficult for Canada to make progress with the US on other matters and issues?  Definitely.  The practical and most effective way that Trudeau could have supported """"his issues"""" (to borrow Leah's phrase) would have been to calmly and tactfully acknowledge (as he did) that differences exist and back in Canada continue to reflect these in the Federal Government's actions.  This he's doing and Canada thereby, to that extent, becomes a practical example globally of success regarding these matters.

0,"DACA and the whole immigration 'reform' (something that is done periodically in this country) has always been a political 'hot potato'.  Republicans were afraid to touch it and upset their 'base' and especially afraid to compromise in a way that implied working with Obama (the evil one).  Obama gave Republicans a gift with DACA.  They could oppose his 'over-reach' of power while ignoring that the bad press of Obama enforcing 'cruel' laws that the Republicans were not willing to change would have hurt the Republicans even more.  All the while it allowed them to not anger their 'base'.  Now they have Trump who they cannot rely on to make a hard political choice.  Here is the news.  DACA is popular.  Republicans will take a political hit now that letting it die or passing a law renewing it will be their responsibility.  Notice they are all trying to avoid picking up the problem of 'Immigration reform' now that they are in charge.

Thus, in Russian, his name now  is spelled out as TRAMP.   I wonder how many Russians know what tramp means in English, pretty much the opposite of Trump. I just discovered this last night so was looking  for someplace to share a laugh over this.

They believe that their way of life is somehow being destroyed and that liberals are the root of all evil in this country.  It isn't stupid, it is propaganda that is aimed at people who are already dissatisfied with something in society or their own lives, that propaganda gives them somewhere to place the blame for everything wrong with this country or their own lives.  Stupid, no, not at all, but fed a diet of lies for decades, absolutely.  Unfortunately, Trump is the result of 30 years of those lies.

Therefore, I see the arguments for voting for a third party in this election are at best superfluous if not plain wrong.  The choice is Trump or Clinton. We can dissect and argue about the past and their previous actions for a long time but we all know that the differences between them are very significant. A Trump election will be a disaster based on multiple reasons described in yesterday's letters to the editor. We cannot keep our heads in the sand by arguments that imply that both candidates are equally """"bad"""" and that we need to vote for a Third Party or not vote at all. Such actions are a vote for Trump.

But thats no surprise because the republican party hasn't had an original idea in 2 generations. Conservatives have been whining about the ACA for seven years but in all that time they couldn't come up with a coherent plan. And finally, if conservatives feel they have to sabotage the ACA, that clearly indicates that Obamacare is far, far from the abject failure that they say it is.  This whole episode is further proof of one indisputable fact: for the better part of 20 years, everybody that conservatives rely on to tell them the truth, from Limbaugh to FOX news to Paul Ryan, the republican party and to Trump himself, everyone that conservatives depend on to tell them the truth is a liar and a fraud. It really is as simple as that.

0,"According to the far right news sites like Infowars, General McMasters, Trump's national security advisor, is the source of the leaks, including the one about Trump leaking classified information to the Russians. They say this is the reason he intentionally does a poor job defending Trump (like when McMasters said Trump could not tell classified from unclassified information). The story variations are that he is a plant for the military that is trying to get rid of Trump (they say that McMasters is keeping his General position?), or a plant for Hillary, Obama, or the CIA-- take your pick. I like the military pick since US Generals in the Middle East have said they do not like the idea of giving information to Russia for assistance fighting ISIS because they do not trust the Russians who have tried to sabotage US mission in Syria by attacking US backed troops and in Afghanistan the Military is trying to convince Trump that Russia is supporting the Taliban.

1,"A large percentage of those """"poorly educated"""" white folks in the Rust Belt that elected Trump are more comfortable being victims than taking responsibility for their choices in life. No one is profiling them. No one is trying to deport them. They get to vote if they want to. They are the only demographic dying younger and they are killing themselves with their behaviors. As technology and globalization make bigotry and racism less profitable, they refuse to change with the times. On some deep level they realize that merit and equality for all are social and economic demotions for them. They would rather die than admit this truth. Sadly, like they do in their families when they commit murder suicides, they want to take the rest of us down with them if they can't have their way. Then along came Russia with their boy Trump. They treat him like their savior. This even though he has never saved anyone but himself. Being ignorant is not a good strategy for success in the 21st century.

Yes, the violence has to be dealt with, but the ISSUE here, folks, is white nationalists and neo-nazis spewing their racist, anti-semitic hate. There is no middle ground here. There is no equivalency. On one side you have people who want to purge America of Jews, minorities, and immigrants, just as the Nazis in Germany attempted to do in their country. On the other side you have people who are against that. The fact that violence erupts does not in any way make the two sides somehow equivalent. One right and one is wrong. By not condemning the wrong, you are supporting it, accepting it, enabling it; it's that simple. Which side are you on? Which side is our president on?

Villanueva's presence on the field, therefore, was interesting.  One of the pretenses for Trump's racist play, embraced by many here, is that non-compliance with superiors' orders should lead to firing.  Well, in Villanueva's case, what if he was disobeying Tomlin's orders for the TEAM to remain together in the locker room?  """"There should be no politics in sports, after all.""""  Or, what if Villanueve just felt really strongly about it, and Tomlin disagreed, but respected his desire to """"express"""" himself?

Trump may be president but the American people will dump him like the plaque if he gets to pushy.  I suspect Trump will blow up his presidency before he blows up ISIS.  He will commit an impeachable offense within a month into his presidency. He has thin skin and lashes out at the silliness of SNL skits.  America will look the other way for awhile, but eventually Trump will insult the diversity of Americans one too many times.  People will take to the streets and take America back.

While Hillary's have had fractions of the people inside with crickets outside. I honestly think this race is going to be close. The manipulation of the polls is exactly what happened with brexit. Where they polled specifically to create propoganda to support against the exit. It happens, and has happened in our country before. 1980 presidential election had Carter up 9 points 5 days out from the election. The media completely wrote off the actor running for president. Ronald won by what 8 points. When you look at the sample data from the polls like Abc's recent poll and it polled 36% Dems, 27% rep, and 36% ind. It's not an accurate reflection of the voter. They are assuming a 9% increase in dem voters and that's not accurate.

After it was revealed that the Deputy Director of the FBI was the Deep Throat that brought down Nixon, people are much wiser to the games being played. Mueller's job is to find Trump's Watergate Hotel and keep it in his hip pocket until needed. They will also need to find a Gerald Ford to replace Spiro Agnew (Mike Pence).

0,"Egan doesn't bother me, he is a historical ignoramus, he should stick to president Trump put downs.  Egan contradicts himself, the point of the two quotes.  It was not foreordained that the Confederacy would lose.  In September 1862, General Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia were on a role, had just invaded Maryland, and were about to invade Pennsylvania.  General McClellan and the Army of the Potomac were bewildered, confused, and at a loss as to what to do.  Accidentally, a Union Corporal finds Special Order 91 in a field, Lee's complete battle plan.  McClellan suddenly knows what to do, catches Lee off guard, and barely pulls off a draw at the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in american history.

In all of these measures republicans by and large are the part of America right now (Trump won 86% of the counties, some 35+ republican governors, loss of 1,000+ state elected officials from democrat party under Obama).  Like it or not, America has responded to the past 8 years and isn't happy in the direction it is going.

When compared to the US, our corporate tax rates are lower, but top marginal income tax rate is higher asides a few states and with the NDP plan only California will be higher (that is assuming Trump doesn't cut taxes, which he will).  So while not devastating it leaves little room to raise further if things go badly and its better to leave room to raise them if we need to in the future.

0,"Factors to keep in mind as the new admin goes forward...this from Forbes Magazine  Compared to other Western governments, the US government taxes at a very low level, about 18% of GDP.  Why can’t Congress just change the budget rules? Because changing them would require a 60% majority vote that the Republicans don’t have. Perversely, Democrats have become the party of balanced budgets because of their Wall Street connections. Congress made the budget rules in 1984, in the wake of the Reagan tax cuts, specifically to constrain tax cutting.  Trump wants to cut the corporate income tax rate by more than half, to 15%, and make that available to the half of all US businesses that are not in corporate form.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/leesheppard/2016/11/13/trumps-tax-plan/#5a0fcf0d1110  Corporate attorneys will definitely see a boom in their biz if this passes.

0,"Some of the Trump's hopes for an updated NAFTA should be non-starters:  1) Elimination of the dispute resolution mechanism. Rather than elimination, this needs to be strengthened and the timeline to decisions shortened because US corporations can use duties and tariffs as an economic weapon to weaken their rivals, even when facing fair and open competition. The softwood dispute is a perfect example.  2) Currency manipulation. If it becomes part of a new NAFTA, US corporations could use this, in combination with the loss of a dispute resolution mechanism, as another weapon to defeat rivals rather than a means to seek a level playing field.  3) 'Buy American', but American firms get access to municipal, provincial and federal procurements. Possibly something to be bartered away during negotiations. But Trump might actually think this is a realistic and 'fair' demand in exchange for access to the US market.  I'd like to see a fulsome discussion of US agricultural subsidies in our media.

Between the bottom 30% of the suffering population and the upper 30% of the wealthy population is the 40% of middle class. They are the vital connection between rich and poor. They are the voters who win or lose elections. They move the country left or right.

We cannot turn back the clock, but if President Trump was elected 8 years ago, do you believe a half million deaths would have occurred in the middle east? Do you believe ISIS would exist today, be about the same, or be stronger and a larger presence throughout the world?  Clearly Trump wanted to send a firm message to all evil regimes, that we're not going to """"lead from behind"""". Trump is not going to criticize the U.S. He's not going to weaken the U.S. by promoting the export of jobs.

We won't know who that person is until Monday or Tuesday, when Fusion GPS is compelled to release that information.

When Bush dropped out, and Trump won the Republican nomination, Fusion GPS then shopped their investigation around and ended up with an attorney with connections to both the DNC and the HRC campaign picking up the tab.  HOWEVER, there is almost NO indication that either the DNC or the HRC campaign ever saw the materials developed by Fusion GPS.

0,"The reason Obama didn't accuse Bush of this is easy: Bush didn't do it. It is also likely that Obama didn't do exactly what Trump accused him of, but there is a likelihood Obama's Justice Department did do some nefarious things in exploring Trump's acquaintances in order to help Hillary win. The NY Times reported the FBI investigated Trump and found nothing. Remember, the FBI only investigates crimes. The Justice Dept. then morphed it into a national security investigation, trying to get a FISA warrant last June, but were denied. They narrowed the scope in a last ditch effort to derail Trump and got a FISA warrant to investigate 3 former associates in Oct. just before the election. Still nothing, and Hillary loses. So they come up with the ruse that Trump colluded with the Russians, without a scintilla of evidence. Trump's tweet finally made them back off as it could expose how the Justice Dept. was skirting the law using FISA illegally to wiretap American citizens. Shameful behavior.

By the way, given the tweets by segment, it was in isolation that some read the communication.  If folks actually read the tweets sequentially as you imply they would have recognized the DoI for what it was.  No, this is fake news as the implications regarding Trump are implied rather than known.

0,"Ivanka Trump’s 2009 self-help book, “The Trump Card,” opens with an unlikely sentence: “In business, as in life, nothing is ever handed to you.”  Ivanka quickly adds caveats. “Yes, I’ve had the great good fortune to be born into a life of wealth and privilege, with a name to match,” she writes. “Yes, I’ve had every opportunity, every advantage. And yes, I’ve chosen to build my career on a foundation built by my father and grandfather.”   Still, she insists, she and her brothers didn’t attain their positions in their father’s company “by any kind of birthright or foregone conclusion.”  The cognitive dissonance on display here might prompt a reader who wishes to preserve their sanity to close the book immediately.  http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ivanka-trumps-terrible-book-helps-explain-the-trump-family-ethos  The article is full of sick examples of Ivanka's incredibly vacuous thinking.

Most posts here reflect the MAGAphant view that everyone needs to be deported.  And too many on the left think that there's no problem with unbridled immigration. Neither is workable in the long run.  Trump has not helped this situation with his rhetoric or his blatant racism.  The republican congress also does not help.  Republicans have controlled the House since 2010 and there has not been a single attempt at an immigration bill.

Assume one third of these are reasonably fit adults--246,000, give or take.  Knock off about 20% of those for various hardship exemptions--job, child care, village too far away, etc.  That would leave maybe 200,000.  Divide us into 100-person teams, each team to be on duty for one 24-hour period.  That makes 2,000 teams.  1,460 days in the Orange Monster's term (assuming he survives).  So each team would pull maybe a shift and a half shoveling Trumpshite.  Our senators, though, are so important and knowledgeable (and, more to the point, as Republicans they have more responsibility), so I propose that one of them should be supervisor of each team.  24 hours on, 24 off.

Then, a month or two later, it became known that Rick Wilson (Republican operative) was looking for dirt. The same person gave the hotel story but added the Russian angle given the hacking allegations and the piss angle because Rick's son runs a piss fetish website. That is how it ended up getting to McCain (through Rick). I saw this going around on 4chan in October 2016 with my own eyes. There was even an accompanying video.

The reason that millions of working people support Donald Trump is that they know he will represent working people and small businesses--lower taxes, less corruption in government and that Donald Trump will end the criminal US government wars abroad that have killed millions of people and wasted trillions of dollars. Donald Trump will bring US troops home to their families to rebuild America. This is why war criminal Hillary Clinton and her criminal corporate supporters hate Donald Trump why they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars spreading lies and deceit about Donald Trump.

0,"So much media BS.  The real issue on the matter is should one man (Obama) make a unilateral decision on such a matter or should it be legislation voted by congress representing the people of USA?  Trump is merely canceling an executive order with 6 month delay so that congress can draft legislation, vote yes or no and then follow the same with senate. This way the population has spoken.  If as we are to believe reporting and this is what everyone wants then the US government will vote to allow them to stay. IMO congress does not want this expected responsibility as too many do not want to have their vote registered on record.  Too Bad!!  This is not about Trump or racism or Nazi's its about who should decide.  The President? or the US Government!

Unless Trump cuts interest rates drastically, we will only see exchange rates go very badly for the Cdn dollar and Chinese yuan.  If there are sweeping 'buy american' tax rules, more energy supply from the US going energy-independent, and new tariffs, we will see our dollar at 50 cents in two years.

I know I have.  The difference between Trump and Hillary is Trump is running a business and investing economic projects. He is actively managing wealth through the investments he chooses.  Want to talk lawsuits? Those are also extremely common in real estate development. The fact that he has many is irrelevant. Bankruptcies and lawsuits are part of doing business in real estate development. Everyone, big or small runs across those issues at some point.

There is no doubt that DACA has helped several hundred thousand illegal immigrants, but the program was created by executive action which the Attorney General and other legal scholars say is unconstitutional because it makes or changes immigration law, which only Congress can do.  Trump should not be blamed for following the Constitution.

After voting for three bills that would have gutted the ACA and thrown twenty three million (or more) Americans off their health care plan he is doing exactly what I predicted he would  - waffling.  “The goal is not to take away your health care"""" - Really Cory? It looked to me like the goal of the GOP plan was to kick as many poor people off their plan as possible and give a huge tax cut to the .01%.  Gardner sees the handwriting on the wall. Thus his sudden concern for the little people's health care - and his turning on Trump. His chances of a second term were slim to start with and they are fading by the hour with Trump in the White House. Barring some duex es machina Democratic voter turnout is going to be overwhelming in 2020, when Cory is up for re-election. By then I suspect Cory and most GOP incumbents will be praying for Trump to choke on his own bile.

The Russian operatives then used a Facebook “retargeting” tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites. We could just as easily be describing an effort by the NRA or the RNC. Except that it was a foreign government intent on undermining American interests.

0,"TheOtherHand, just because an entrepreneur does not beat the stock market return in a timeframe selected with 20/20 hindsight does not mean he has no skills. Many entrepreneurs during the same timeframe lost everything; others did better. So what? Trump took many risks, built his personal skill set, and was highly successful. He employed thousands of people and created some spectacular buildings in the process rather than sitting on his rump as a passive investor. And by the time this """"analysis"""" sets as it's starting point, Trump had already turned his original $14 million loan from his dad into over $1 billion if AP is right. If you calculate his return from the $14 million beginning, assuming the AP is right about his $4 billion net worth, that would be a 28,571% return, albeit over a longer timeframe.

I don't think she wants to be where she is, but is trying to make the best of it. Most spouses of politicians know what they are getting into, and probably have campaigned right alongside. Melania Trump is a reluctant First Lady. It's one thing if someone hands her a speech with plagiarisms in it (blame the speechwriters, instead). But to attack her for speaking with an accent is stupid. Likewise, attacking her for staying in NYC for six months while Barron completed a school year. I could easily see many parents doing that when their spouse gets a new job in a different city. But then, most spouses don't carry a 65% nationwide disapproval rating on their shoulders. I think we should leave Melania Trump alone.

One Chinese concern is a relatively stable North Korea, to act as a buffer between China and South Korea and to prevent millions of North Koreans from flooding China.

This is true for the current POTUS as well, given his own checkered past which is well documented.

I am an independent, soon to be 63, who has seen a lot of elections.   The President does not and can not,  dictate domestic policy.  Trump won't fix it, Hillary won't either.  It seems you want this to be a battle of two individuals and the reality is that it isn't.    The political parties and their combined resources are waging the war.  I'm an independent that seek solutions, not 'victory'.  Hillary doesn't scare me and neither does Trump.  It's an election, not a coronation.

He said the President was not briefed on the information beforehand and he did not know the sources before he spoke and was not aware of what was classified and what was not. My take is that if he had been aware of the high security attached and the source and concerns attached to the source, and the risks of disclosure, maybe he would not have said what he did to the Russians or would have been more careful. McMasters also said the disclosure was """"appropriate"""" which I take it means it fit the nature of the discussion Trump had with the Russians-- it was appropriate for the discussion. The question posed by the security persons who spoke to the Washington Post has not been answered. Was this a smart thing to do?

The same thing is true of domestic violence, substance abuse, sexual abuse, unwanted pregnancies, low academic achievement ... . This narrative has been debunked many times before.  In terms of crime rate, America's cities are actually far safer than its rural areas.  Overall America's rates of all types of violent crime have fallen 40% since 1990. .

0,"The slow spot in the Trump regime is Trump—and that’s not even in question. Of 559 key positions that need to be confirmed by the Senate, 442 don’t even have a nominee. And why is that?  There are two reasons. One: Trump is demanding a loyalty test that discards anyone who ever said anything about Trump, which excludes most everyone, Republicans included. Two: people are simply scared to work for Trump.  The escalating investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials is also scaring off people who’d been on the fence about joining the administration.   It’s a recipe for never filling crucial roles.

Both look like they were designed for downtown Chicago. Hmm, wonder where that came from? In any case, Trump understands and is very pro construction, so he is faced with a real dilemma.

Then the USA takes 18% of those exports. So, that's less than 4% of GDP.   At the other end, GM sells more cars in China than they do in the USA.  China has also threatened to cancel orders from Boeing.  They also hold $1.119 trillion dollars worth of US treasury bonds.

Basically all Trudeau did was reassert Canadian values. What's wrong with that?  As for going further, Canadians need to be mindful of the elephant that could yawn and roll over onto us. It's always been the case that Canada has limited options given our economic ties to the behemoth south of our border. Unless Canadians are willing to put their jobs on the line, caution should guide the government going forward. So far I'd say they are doing a good job of finding balance.  As for Canada not being the """"Donald Trump Opposition Party,"""" fine, but that should not mean that we throw out our interests, abrogate treaties, not stand with our allies, jettison the Geneva Convention, etc. I'm really unclear on what Ms. Wente means when by the statement.

At times Ontario is even forced to pay Michigan and New York to take its surplus power.

I watched both ABC and NBC National news last night.   Both covered the Twitters.  Neither one of them mentioned that Pelosi had initially denied ever meeting with the Ambassador until after Politico produced the actual picture of her doing so and then her spokesman told the tale that she had obviously meant never met him 'one-on-one; in private.  The message was tweaked to Pelosi's advantage by both NBC and CBS.  That is what the media despise; they are not able to control reality any more.

I am glad to see the NCR do a piece on the beginning of the Resistance...i.e. The Women's March....think it should be noted that similar marches occurred nation and worldwide. In my area Oakland CA I assure you that women of every color and cultural background were present it was NOT a whites only deal contrary to the articles description of some 5 folks taken somewhere in DC...and there were a large number of men as well. My experience of these marches and I had family and friends in DC, Oakland, LA, Eugene, Portland and many other locations...was that these folks were horrified by Trump for many diverse reasons..a large number had never been involved in a demonstration ever in their lives...and sorting these guys out into organizations that spoke to their concerns was a huge challenge. The development very shortly after the march of the Indivisible Manual (read it) and the groups was an answer to where to place these marchers.....

Do you not realize that Trump is easily the most pouting, whining, excuse-making, name-calling candidate for president in the history of the republic? What level of hypocrisy does it require to cheer him on when he does it, but snivel like a politically correct whiner when someone else does the same?

0,"Trump is Putin's sock puppet, and Putin wants America weakened, isolated, and muttering to itself. Trump is Putin's greatest achievement, though if there is ever any direct evidence, Putin will face a fury quite unlike he has ever faced before. The Ukrainians ran his thuggish puppet out and forced him to flee to Russia in order to save his life. I thought it would be impossible for me to be more cynical than I was during Nixon's reign, then came Cheney. It took years to get the info that Nixon and Kissinger stopped peace in the Vietnam War so they could gain power, though thousands of American troops died, and perhaps it will take years to see Trump's taxes and other info to find out why he is devoted to alienating all our allies, and I am sure, bankrupting us in another insane Middle East War, and deregulating Wall Street to the next Depression. But on the other hand, SNL is better than it has ever been. Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

We now have a US President who is taking actions against the President Elect.  The media is reporting it as protecting his legacy and yet his actions are unprecedented in modern times. We didn't see this from Clinton to Bush or Carter to Regan.  We are witnessing a current president who has openly admitted, he will question and challenge the president elect and his actions.  There has been no editorials challenging and questioning Obama and his actions after the election.

If there was going to be a coup, there would have been far easier times for it to have occurred (see the list and prestige of some of those generals/presidents).  As a side note, in my opinion, one reason LTG McMater's has not resigned his commission is to allow him to refuse any illegal, immoral, or unethical order by president Trump, not only as the National Security Adviser but as a Lieutenant General (three stars).  I don't know much about the NSA's oath of office but a commissioned military's highest oath is to the Constitution, not the president.  This whole military coup nonsense is just democratic hyperventilating about nothing.  Hopefully, anyone worried about a coup carries a small brown paper bag around with them.

Trump won 3,084 of them. Clinton won 57.  There are 62 counties in New York State. Trump won 46 of them. Clinton won 16.  Clinton won the popular vote by approx. 1.5 million votes.  In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump. (Clinton only won 4 of these counties; Trump won Richmond)  Therefore these 5 counties alone, more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country.  These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles. The United States is comprised of 3, 797,000 square miles. I fact checked and it’s accurate too

Lefties are starting to see that pushing the boundaries, burning the town down, waging protest, resistance, anarchy and """"revolution"""",  can be and is increasingly being done by the other side too.  Trump is a perfect example: in a more balanced time, a time when liberals and progressives might seriously consider viewpoints from the right of centre, from other than their own vantage point, a man like him would never have been elected President.  If you're looking for a fight you'll find one.

0,"No, the president does not OWN the judiciary. He can nominate the AG, and the AG serves as political advisor to the president; but also serves as an independent chief prosecutor, which is why investigations do not need permission from a president.

(where Trump's business dealings are under investigation).

However the smart money's on the USA east coast --south to the sun belt. Carolinas or Georgia--even Texas.

I usually don't feed the trolls, but here goes:  There isn't room in a comment-box for a true accounting of solutions. I have them, but the moment I try putting one out, Civil Comments is used to quash them as there are certain people here that don't like my commentary - like you.  500 words or so isn't enough space, either. I AM educated on the problems, there are solutions, unfortunately some of them run afoul of the Liberal camp and the ACLU, which give thieves and junkies more rights than the law-abiding. With all of that it's difficult to express how to help fix the issues. It requires thought, conviction, and drive. I have that, but I don't own any legislators. I don't even have enough money to rent one.  Aside all that, if you're tired of my complaints, please use the Civil Comments 'mute' function. You are more educated than me, right? You knew about that function, right?

0,"This kind of one sided reporting is what got me on Breitbart,Infowars and the Corbett Report when Trump started making more sense than Clinton.  How come is it Ok for Mexico to have a wall on its southern border with Central America and aggressively remove illegal aliens from Mexico aggressively but the USA is racist if it wants to enforce its immigration laws?  Does this logic apply to Canada as well?  Is that why we cannot enforce our immigration laws in our sanctuary cities like Toronto with an estimated 250,000 illegal aliens getting full government services.  I guess us taxpayers should just foot the bill and shut up for  fear of being perceived as racist

Furthermore, one cannot meet with officials of a foreign government to negotiate terms without the authorization of the US government.

It describes a quid pro quo arrangement which is definitely illegal.  And aren't we much closer to seeing Trump as Putin's poodle? Trump complained in tweets that Obama didn't punish the Russians enough over the meddling. Then Trump wants to forgive and forget. Then he even wants to share US cyber-secrets with the Kremlin.

0,"A study in contrasting styles of mendacity: President Trump goes to the CIA and lies, easily and comfortably, about the genesis of his dispute with the intelligence community and about the size of the inauguration crowds. He lies easily because ‘truth’ is a meaningless concept to him; he has never had a point of reference for it. He has no consciousness of guilt when he’s spewing falsehoods because he has no moral center from which awareness of guilt emanates for most people. Sean Spicer appears before the press to tell the same lies, but his awareness that he is lying, his awareness that everyone in the room knows he’s lying, is evident in his defensiveness, his rage, and his cowardice (scurrying away without answering questions.) And then there’s Kellyanne Conway's instantly infamous “alternative facts.” Now comes word that Trump’s promise to release his taxes after the “audit” is as meaningless as everything else he says. No surprise, that.

Naturally, a politically ambitious mayor wants to avoid criticism in the handling of this terrible disaster by passing the buck and blame to leaders higher up the food chain.  Trump is the obvious target because PR is a left wing Democratic basket case dependent on perpetual handouts from the mainland so the GOP and especially this GOP president are already unpopular there and thus easy marks in the blame game.

0,"I agree.  No matter what you feel about Trump's immigration policy, it would be a horrible legal precedent if this type of legal reasoning prevails.  The order needs to be evaluated on its language and how it is implemented, not just rhetoric from the campaign or the administration.  The first EO had problems both in terms of language and implementation, the second EO is much cleaner on both counts.   It could turn out that how the second EO is implemented over time amounts to a ban on muslims, at that point the anti-muslim rhetoric from the administration would become relevant.

0,"Donald Trump rode through the disconnect created by the two-party system. Read again the warning of John Adams (2nd President of the United States):  """"There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.""""  -- John Adams, Letter to Jonathan Jackson (2 October 1780), """"The Works of John Adams"""", vol 9, p.511  After a brief burst of common effort following 9/11, the two parties became again dedicated to the destruction of each other and they lost touch with Americans creating a gap that Donald Trump exploited.  Donald Trump is not a Republican or a Democrat in any sense of those terms.  He is simply a glib opportunist with little concept of a world outside New York City.  The flash point will come soon and it probably will be Taiwan.

Conventional military might for national defense is a given, but its effectiveness in controlling the rest of the world is long past.

It makes sense to cut federal spending on questionable programs with huge overheads (primarily for bureaucracy). Funding must be based on the biggest bang for the buck, and Trumpet's proposed cuts may be a move toward greater fiscal responsibility -- as long as we don't end up pouring the savings into the gaping hole that's the military-industrial complex or programs that have been broken for decades but continue to receive funding as entitlement.

The MSM does not report the truth and this is the obvious reason for his rallies and tweets  Because ALL of those people """"investigating"""" the President are behind the REAL RUSSIAN COLLUSION!  Podesta and Clinton CONSPIRED WITH THE RUSSIANS to sell them 20% of the USA supply of Uranium and a very substantial amount of money was paid to the Clinton Foundation for facilitating this sale via Bill Clintons speaking fees.  WHERE is the investigation of this ACTUAL crime?!

0,"For certain conservatives, it always boils down to """"But, Hillary!"""" IIRC, when President Obama came into office, numerous Democrats wanted George W Bush and his top associates investigated for war crimes. Obama turned them down flat. I'll say this much for your idea: If President Trump gets desperate enough and orders Attorney General Sessions to prosecute Hillary Clinton, every Trump supporter would stand up and salute, and a Republican Congress would have a hard time finding the legislators to continue investigating Russian attempts to interfere with the election. People would be so distracted, the Republicans could pass anything they wanted to. But it smacks of despotism, of banana republic dictators. And, think about this: If a Democrat wins the 2020 presidential election, and ordered President Trump be investigated for obstruction of justice, graft, violating the emoluments clause, etc., Trump supporters wouldn't have a leg to stand on. All their howling would be so much hot air.

1,"Sorry Steven, don't see how that's racist.  Obama (whose name backwards in Latin means 'I will love', and might be intepreted as vaguely lecherous) had an non-American father.  If he'd been, say, Slovenian, the level of suspicion concerning his citizenship would have been the same. Of course, Melania was Slovenian, and her name comes from the Greek μελαινα, which means black, or to the medically inclined (as 'melaena'), 'black stool resulting from an upper GI bleed'.  So if Trump were a racist, would he marry someone whose name means 'black'?  That's civil marriage, of course, because it was his third. Anyway, getting back to football, this afternoon I watched the local second XV take on Tunbridge Wells.  None of this ridiculous overspecialisation of American football--offence, defence, special teams--and no Darth Vader suits either.  Just a bunch of sweaty men jumping on top of each other.

1,"Another issue we should be concerned with, is Trump's discretionary drug use. Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years, according to a report released by his doctor.  The side effects of this drug are legion, and serious.  The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a """"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,"""" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?  Trump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

Your buddy Trump probably has paid very little in tax in the last 20 years.  He's refused to release any tax returns, unlike any other nominee for decades. One that was supposedly """"leaked,"""" was probably released surreptitiously by him (was it 2005?), I presume because that was the one year he actually paid taxes.  One of the biggest items for the """"R""""s is eliminating payment of any estate taxes, which Frank Luntz had them retitling as """"death taxes.""""  They've had the % to be paid on them cut endlessly, and the first $5.49 million are exempted entirely.  So if someone built up a fortune in equity, and then died, it will transfer to their heirs, most of whom won't have to pay anything on the appreciation of assets before being passed on.  35 states have no estate tax. 44 have no inheritance tax.

Trump, like Nixon will resign rather than be impeached and Donald, Melania, Barron, Ivanka & Jared will all have to move their schaatz out of the Whitehouse, making Pence president, assuming he does not get dragged down in Mueller's investigation.  Actually Paul Ryan would love that casue he is 3rd in line for the presidency and he would be made President for a year or two and then he will campaign for a full term.

0,"I think talk of Comey taking Trump down is likely premature.  While support for Donald's impeachment is at an all time high -- 43% compared to an approval rating of 36% -- that process is long and tortuous.  The House needs a majority, then the Senate must hold a trial -- and a 2/3 majority is needed in the Senate.  Donald won't resign -- the only time he ever gives up a fight is when he can line his own pocket (see his many bankruptcies) -- so going down is likely not in the cards.  However, Comey will further damage his credibility.  More Republicans will abandon him, and even some of his willfully ignorant supporters will finally see that it isn't fake news after all.  This could have the effect of making him a lame duck less than a year into his term.  Not so terriffic for stability or getting things done -- but at this point, I would rather have a United States that does nothing than one that follows Trump's script.

It's essentially self-infantalizing a massive number of Americans have opted for instead of being part of making hard decisions like adults.  Trump is less an outcome of this than a symptom -- the soft-serve idea crowd literally put a man-baby -- one of their own, intellectually, if not in economic terms -- in the White House and now want to hide from the consequences of their actions by shoveling more of that soft-serve fake news into their maws.

0,"Indeed. That whole episode was stage managed by the PR firm Hill and Knowlton.  This is nothing like that. Unless you are alleging a vast conspiracy featuring fake doctors and fake aid workers and fake dead people, I assume you accept the wealth of evidence that establishes that a chemical attack happened using Sarin gas that killed upwards of 80 people. According to many witnesses, the weapon was delivered by the Syrian air force. The story that a wayward rocket hit a weapons dump and released the chemical is farcical — in that scenario, the gas, which is stored in an inert state, would have been incinerated and rendered harmless. The attack was perpetrated by the Assad regime.  However, what is confusing is the Trump administration's response.  Up until the attack, statements from the administration indicated that they were giving Assad a free hand. I believe that is why the attack happened. What happens now is anyone's guess.

0,"3/3 But to acknowledge Trump as a legitimate president does not mean that we should “normalize” him. We can’t accept as “normal” a president who is utterly unqualified for the office: racist, sexist, fascist; corrupt, incompetent, unstable.  His inauguration won't rehabilitate him; he is who and what he is. We can’t allow that to be a new normal for future presidents, and we can’t act as though this is a normal presidency.  We must do everything we can to contain and restrain Trump’s fascist impulses, and we must try to minimize the damage he will do to everyone except for folks in the top 1% or 2% (by wealth). He’s going to break most of his promises, which is bad; he’s going to try to keep some of them, which is worse. He’s forming a government of, by and for the filthy rich. He’s a reckless, dangerous man. No, this can’t be normal.

1,"The Great Trump Wall not only keeps out illegal Mexican aliens, it stops the smuggling of narcotics into the USA, mainly originating from Colombia and Mexico.  The trafficking of drugs into the USA is a multi-Billion $$$ business and supported by the Mexican government. It is also supported by interests, political and criminal, within the USA.... believe it.  Mexican illegals are also infiltrating into the USA to take over the distribution of the drugs because the distribution chain run by Americans is inefficient and sick,  e.g. shootings in Chicago is over drug turf.  Mexico is a narco-state and their President Pena Nieto of the corrupt PRI party are getting drug money from the drug lords, and that is indisputable.  If the Wall starts to go up, the only recourse for the narco-crooks is to """"reach"""" the POTUS and his family...  with extreme prejudice.... in a desperate attempt to stop the Wall.... believe it too !!!

But the government chose to direct the benefits to the top - corporate profits and executive compensation, Wall Street moneyman who manage the vast profit for handsome returns. Factories were moved and workers fired. This is how the U.S. implemented NAFTA. Trump blame the agreement wrongly. He should blame the implementation policies.  Trump can tweak all he wants. He may negotiate vast changes. He may even cancel. But he will not fix a single darn thing. The only fix is to overhaul America's Trickle-Down economic and taxation policies.

They have shown consistent disregard for decisions handed down by international tribunals.

The worst that is going to happen is Trump will say he doesn't recognize the One China policy yet he doesn't recognize Taiwan independence.  The whole thing is a negotiating ploy. He doesn't care about Taiwan or the fate of its people. China can hit Taiwan with missiles and Trump will see it as a business opportunity to sell weapons.

With Trump's promise to expand the Navy throughout the world and the number of active duty ships, it's almost impossible for the U.S. Navy to leave Hawaii because it's 1 of only 4 U.S. ports that are equipped to fully repair a U.S. Navy ship and the Pacific Theater is going to play an even larger role due to China's ramp up of it's military forces in the Pacific.  Besides, as I stated before, the Republicans have been totally against any Hawaiian Kingdom in any way, shape, or form from being created and that includes the Akaka Bill which would have created a nation within a nation.  Any hope of any form of Hawaiian self governance has been lost for at least the next four years, and if you think otherwise, then prepare to be disappointed.

Any elected official who schemes to take health care away from sick people is doing it to Jesus.  For those who actively support Republican schemes to rob the poor of health care, and thus shorten their lives, Jesus asks (Luke 6:46) ““Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I tell you?”  One waits in vain for an answer from the likes of Paul Ryan and Donald Trump.  It is a great tragedy to see people who are always quick to proclaim in word that Jesus is Lord scouring our Lord with their deeds by denying Him health care.

If you listen to Comey he ask his friend to leak the """"content"""" of the memo's. His friend didn't realize that by making the existence known he was putting Comey in hot water. A point I think that Michael Schmidt didn't realize either, because he was fixated on  (proving obstruction). Comey in order to maintain credibility and lessen the inquisition into his leaking came up with the idea of (in order to insure a special counsel) would be appointed. The first leak reported  on the 11th of a conversation which was between Comey and Trump, let Trump know who had leaked the information. The mention of the tapes were made after the initial leak.

It is insane to trust the Republican Party to select a President, they have given us Nixon and Ford, Bush and Bush, and our truly strange present day Pharaoh and his gilded family. They do have great PR people. I must admit that, they can con the poor to vote against their interests, time and again. Without the Electoral College we wouldn't have had George W.

Many Latin Americans come to escape extreme poverty and extreme violence  (see below) - literally  to save their children. Most would do the same to save their children. The US is the wealthiest in the world. We can afford to do more.  https://www.christiancentury.org/blog-post/tell-judge-he-wasn't-lying

I mean for sure, with all the riots going on in the states, that is the exact same as Iran. Because Iran has free speech, and for all the criticism against Trump he's started jailing people for talking? He may get in super weird, childish twitter wars and go on about meaningless (again weird) things - such as the inauguration crowds, he has not done anything to suspend free speech or other AMERICANS rights (I say americans as with his immigration ban he has impacted non-american who may work or live in the U.S.).

When an anti-abortion Republican congressman was caught demanding his mistress have an abortion, Caldera was dumb as a post. When Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was accused of sexually abusing 3 underage male students, Caldera was dumb as a post. When Trump was accused by 17 women of sexual harassment during the campaign and bragged that because he was rich, he was entitled to sexual assault any woman he wanted, Caldera was dumb as a post.

The purported reason for the 90-day country-based ban and the 120-day refugee ban was to allow the government time to come up with a list of countries that weren’t providing the US with enough information, and ban entries from those countries indefinitely. The 90 and 120 days are long gone since Trump signed his executive order. Meanwhile, Trump shot himself in the foot a few weeks ago by depicting Qatar as a terrorist-supporting country, then a few days later selling them $12 billion in weapons. How could the Supreme Court judges realistically impose a travel when today a country is being depicted as terrorist and tomorrow the message is the complete opposite? What a circus!

So when Media Matters front-""""man"""" David Brock (homosexual and possible pedophile) offers a little money to these no-lifers to sit on their computers all day and rip Trump in newspaper comments sections, they take it because they have nothing (children, families, etc) better to do.

It is widely known and fact that Bill Clinton was expe and thrown out of Oxford for raping a young girl.

It's the Trump administration, not the press, that can't get their facts straight. Describing the meeting between Sessions and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, a Justice Department official said, “There’s just not strong recollection of what was said.” Then a White House official told CNBC that there was “superficial” discussion of the election. Finally, Sessions said that he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.”  So there are 3 Trump administration stories: 1) they met, but no one remembers what they talked about, or 2) they met, and they do remember talking about the campaign but only briefly. 3) they never met It's like a child's choose-your-own-adventure book.

Mr. Trump did not create this situation; previous administrations did. In some cases, such as George W. Bush, taxes were reduced whilst a war in Iraq was started, but George got re-elected because the public like the tax cuts. Clinton had balanced the budget before George took over. Obama couldn't stop the outflow of cash expended on medicare and medicaid programs, and then set up an onerous health care system which Trump will revise, but the costs of free drugs to the 65 and over cannot be supported and will lead to the government expenditure exceeding the GNP. Trump's big test will be on the economics file, not on Ivanka's line of nice clothes and dumb judges.

In working and traveling  abroad, I have had excellent care in New Zealand, Australia, England, and British Columbia for a fraction of costs in the USA.

0,"At some point, the effort to govern with all Republican votes was going to fail. Trump just magnified that failure by signing onto a legislative strategy that depended upon it not just for health care and tax reform but also for everything else. There was always going to be a time when the music stopped and they’d be left without chairs to sit in. There are always details and surprises like Hurricane Harvey, but the basic outcome of this play was foreordained. The only thing that could have really changed it was preemptive action by actors who had the foresight, courage and leadership abilities to write a different ending. Trump has none of those qualities. Ryan and McConnell seem to read their lines scene by scene without a greater understanding of their meaning. So, we’ve arrived now. And very few people understand how we got here.

Had it not been for the GOOD gun owner this mentally disturbed lunatic could of easily kept going. In the country the police are usually a long ways off. That man saved lives. I know in Liberal la la land it's all about scary guns. In the real world millions of Canadians currently have a firearm. The reason we don't see gun violence like we do in the US is because we have better mental health and healthcare services . We have less crime and the vast majority of gun owners (99.9%) are solid citizens. People can be mowed down just as easily with the weapons we have here. Furthermore bad guys are caught with illegal weapons daily in all the larger cities in Canada.

Eventually, and historically, this has lead to massive, sweeping revolutions as people rise up to take back what is theirs.

1,"If these people you refer to as 'liberals' are dumb enough to vote for Trump, they deserve to have their jobs exported to countries that are populated by more intelligent people. """"...consign many liberals to hell""""?  """"...he is the only one who truly means what he says about bringing business back to America""""?  Melodrama and romantic farce. Hillary Clinton won't lose to Trump unless Americans are a supremely dull-witted people.

1,"And what advantage was he OBVIOUSLY playing for?  Continued backing and support of White Supremacists.  NO ONE ELSE.  Going forward, support of Trump, a vote for Trump, argument defending Trump, will be judged through the lens of whether someone is a White Supremacist sympathizer.  Like that individual they are supporting, or voting for, or arguing in defense of.  It's how it is.  What's going to be amazing to me is if ANYONE currently a part of Trump's administration, except Bannon, Gorka and Miller, stick around much longer.  Trump has managed to make what appears to be his anti-non-white racism a defining aspect and issue of his Presidency.  It is a measure of just how unsmart he is.  And, the GOP should recognize it as fast as possible.  It is a mistake and uncovering that reveals a lack of intelligence, and arrogance, and a malignant heart that will truly ruin that party unless gotten rid of.   POTUS is a White Supremacist.  That is what people think.  With good reason.  Stupid.

1,"The end is near for him.  And he knows it.  That is what makes him especially dangerous.  He can hit a button and hit Hawaii now.  He is further along than they had hoped he was.  He will be hit when he least expects it, like at his next parade of weapons perhaps.  Trump should give him one last chance...disarm or else.  But this guy is nuts.  Just watch him shoot another missile in a few weeks or so.  He says that he is giving """"gifts"""" to us each time he launches one.  One of these days he will have a nuke on one of them as it lands in the ocean or on some island.  He wants attention, that is why he is doing this.  To let him keep doing this to us is the very definition of insanity.

Not so for the leftist crowd, as they have demonstrated time and again, their own willingness to not only protest peacefully, which is all well and good, and even commendable given unto their own right unto free speech, which is again, commendable, and just fine within our Nation, but.  But.

Both are indulging in toxic fantasies:  The Democrats, that the election can be overturned -- by the Electoral College, by proof of Russian hacking, by Antifa; The Republican Congress that they can impose their own proxy presidency by ignoring Trump and limiting the administration to swamp holdovers.  Trump is a pragmatist.  Pragmatists deal with things as they are, not as they are convinced they should be, and if the Republican Congress cannot or will not act -- either out of spite or incompetence -- Trump will find a workaround, as he has done with the budget.  Ivanka was a deft piece of theater, designed to remind the Republicans in Congress how inconsequential they are if they don't unite behind the leader of their party.

A few million more than half of all American voters were smart enough to figure that out, and when you combine that with his serious moral deficiencies, along with his pathological propensity for lying, the intellectually challenged have elected someone completely inadequate for the position he holds.  At least there's a good chance he'll be impeached before four years is up. But although the Trumpster won't be here for too long, the lack of intelligence, and lack of critical thinking skills that elected him aren't going anywhere soon. Almost half of all voters falls into this category, and unless we fix the broken education system in this country we'll be churning out more and more of these dimwits every year.

Between 2003 and 2013 Ontario lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. During the same decade the Police in the 12 largest population centres received a wage increase of 32 % above inflation. Then the firefighters demand wage parity with the police. While the private sector worker competes with lower priced competition the public sector worker benefits from lower prices.  The above is emblematic of the underlying issue which helped bring Trump to power. The Pain of Globalization is not being shared equally. It's easy for the public sector to support free trade when they only benefit. The fact that they represent the base of the support for the political party pushing this ideology is very troubling.  I believe in Globalization and fair trade but it needs to be achieved fairly and intelligently. It's hard to overstate the importance of these talks.

Trump's presidency is the byproduct of the peerless work of the FSB, the Federal Security Service of Putin's government in Russia.  One of NATO's primary mandates was to check Soviet and now Putin's influence in Europe.  And since Putin probably doesn't like NATO, the FSB has likely long ago instructed Trump and his handlers to make every effort to dismantle it in the event he became president.  So we're likely going to see a severely hobbled version of NATO without any US participation.

John McCain was a good candidate, who was very qualified to be our President.  He deserved the nomination in 2000, but by 2008 he wanted the presidency so badly that he went over to the dark side, and started pandering to the fringe on the right.  It's a dangerous thing, trying to harness hatred.  He chose an utterly scary and unqualified running mate because of her gender, and pretty much created the Tea Party, which in turn spun out of Republican control.  Now the Republicans find themselves without much of an identity, except as the party of hate and negativity.  Their history is better than that.  I think they can come back from this, but it will be hard work, and they will probably lose this next election unless they can escape Trump.

They have nothing worth mining or logging, yet their economy is booming. Why? They invest in education and healthcare for their people.

When the media dominates as it does, it makes it very difficult for Trump to govern, which is the whole point.  And by the way, I'm not a Republican.  Also, Trump is a Democrat/ Republican hybrid.

0,"Hey, it's your assertion not mine. The proof of it is up to you.  I'm not interested in your hand-chosen reading list. I'd like to read the opinion of the expert who diagnosed Trump as a sociopath. Or experts, preferably. Whatcha got?  And please note that I'm not saying you're wrong. A recent study (by experts) found that 21% of American corporate CEO's display psychopathology. That's about the same percentage of psychopaths that are found in the overall prison population, and perhaps 10 times higher than what you find in the general population.  So is it possible that Trump has some form of anti-social personality disorder? As a former CEO, there looks to be about a one-in-five chance that he does. But displaying some of the characteristics of a psychological disorder is not the same as having the disorder. It takes a balanced and non-political assessment to determine that.  By the way, have you ever wondered what percentage of world leaders in general display psychopathology?

0,"Pandora. I thought you were from the city? But clearly no reader of the Times. Because if you were, you would recognize the Robert George piece as a """"profile"""" of the kind that regularly appears in the Magazine. You would also know that until well into the debacle of Trump's campaign, the Times was chilly toward the Clintons, to say the least. So your contention that this piece is """"one-sided"""" in the way that a National Review or Daily Caller column on Hillary would likely be is ludicrous.  1/ You wrote:  """"Then you casually toss in an article from the NY Times magazine as if it were a news report.""""  False. I never indicated or implied the link was a """"news report."""" The link even includes the word """"magazine."""" I first read the piece some years ago, perhaps even when it first ran, but on rereading I was struck by how well it captured both the ethos and the fact of the bishops' alliance with the conservative movement and Republican Party.

0,"We have been watching Trump lie for over a year, so it is no surprise that the Special Counsel should want to question him.  I don't think the real world is willing to accept Trump and his crew's acceptance of alternative facts. Trump, the proven liar says one thing; Comey the other says the opposite, and it seems to me that Trump's past lies would make Comey the man to believe.  Trump had best not tell any of his lies under oath or he may end up in jail for perjury.  Again, real life is not like the reality show Trump has been running in Washington.

How much money did Trump take from a single Alaskan or American last year ?   When big oil companies back out of a project after spending millions----you KNOW the project is a sure loser.   This insanity has to be stopped.  We don't have money to blow on a line that most likely will never be built.  Who's side are you on ?  Clearly not on Alaskan's side.

Clinton's bland, and she didn't promise to shake up the world.  But that's probably reality with the current congress.  And she offered a bland but sane option to republicans who are freaking out about their insane nominee.

He also realized he shared values and policy positions with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.  He chose to run for the presidency as a Democrat and ran a clean, strong campaign.  He energized tens of millions of young Americans to participate in the political process.  Additionally, though he didn't win the nomination, he and his followers made a significant impact on the Democratic platform.  He also had the humility and the pragmatism to rally behind Clinton to oppose the candidacy of Donald Trump, arguably the worst candidate in US political history.  It would have been very easy for him to have """"stayed on the sidelines"""" pouting after the Democratic Party establishment (DNC, et al) machinations against his candidacy were exposed.

Secondly, Trump is the epitomie of every criticism you level at Clinton, yet you clearly fail to see that. For example, Trump is the epitome of an entitlement attitude. It’s stunning that you cannot see that.   Moreover, you completely ignore the fact that Clinton has never been found guilty of anything despite being harassed daily by and investigated by, the rotten-to-the-core GOP for decades.  There is a reason for that and it’s not any of the ludicrous conspiracy theories the right is so fond of.

It shows how false the claim of Trudeau apologists is that he stayed neutral in his remarks to reporters during the election campaign about the two candidates. Here he clearly attacks Trump, given the context, without mentioning him by name. And of course there was also a Liberal fundraising letter that went out in September that looked like it was written by the DNC for which Trudeau never apologized. Contrast it with the way that PM Harper got rid of his chief-of-staff Ian Brodie after he alluded to an allegation coming from a report from his Chicago consul general that indicated, correctly as it turned out, that Obama wasn't serious about renegotiating NAFTA. Harper also made a public statement saying that there was no reason to believe Senator Obama's private views differed from his public ones, whether the PM believed it or not, so as not to interfere in the campaign.

America alone cannot run the world and a U.S. that shrinks back into complete isolationism will see its influence wane. Would average American voters support Trump's apparent strategy to alienate the U.S. from Britain, Canada and Australia and other traditional allies?

0,"Sorry, have to disagree.  Louis Riel twice led a rebellion in Canada. He was involved in the Red River Rebellion in 1869, and fled to the U.S.  Then he was convinced to return to Canada by Gabriel Dumont and others.  He then led the rebellion in 1885 against Canada.  You don't have to like it, but Canada was in fact a country and in those days, it was treason to rebel against a properly constituted government.  I don't think anyone is celebrating, but by the same token, you have to look at things in the historical context in which they took place.  The charge wasn't 'trumped up', it was the law.  Further, he wasn't a leader of the 'Indigenous people.' He was a leader of the Metis and championing their claims to land surveyed in the French fashion, that was overturned in Manitoba by the government's surveyors.  He also was involved in the death sentence of a captive from the Red River Rebellion, supporting his execution.  So, he wasn't quite the benign figure he is painted to be.

As Canada's quintessential """"liberal"""", Lawrence Martin should take responsibility for Canada's right wing drift. Bottom line: in the Pierre Trudeau era, Canadians were brave enough to be independent of the US; today many are afraid to join the entire world in giving Castro his due. Worse they're joining  US crazies like Rubio and Cruz perpetuating the same old Cold War anti-communist propaganda. Wake up, Canadians.

Trump won the nomination for the same reason that Hillary won the nomination -- name recognition.  I know that's sad, I know that's depressing, but it's true and widely known by anyone with even an undergraduate degree in political science.  You really don't have a clue how clueless the average American voter is, do you?  Name recognition can accurately predict the outcome of over 90% of elections.  Exceptions don't change rules.  """"In other words, Bronson, voting does matter. Telling people it doesn't matter only empowers those who have created a rigged Frankenstein democracy.""""  No, voting is a method of control.  It's a way to convince people that they actually chose their masters and desire for them to be there.  """"Without democracy we the people only have civil disobedience or armed rebellion to resort to.""""  Yep, now let it sink in.

0,"1/2 <<Imperfection is not acceptable.>> I'm confident that you don't mean that literally: perfection is not attainable, in health care or anything else, on this side of eternity; and so I take your meaning to be that the status quo is not acceptable; and with that I agree, as I indicated in an earlier post. I think putatively 'pro life' voters who voted for Trump were, at best, naive; but my own naivete was the belief that in 2017 we would have a Democratic president and Congress, and that we would make progress toward truly universal health care.

0,"Democratic Senators Call For Trump To Dump Sam Clovis As Pick For Top USDA Scientist  “For Donald Trump to nominate and to advocate for Senate confirmation of someone with views as backwards as Mr. Clovis’s, is not only a signal to the darkest and most evil forces in this country to carry on, but a clear as day message to the world that this administration continues to tolerate hate,” the senators said in a statement  They cited “the extremist views Mr. Clovis has expressed and the racist conspiracy theories he has stoked”  “President Trump should withdraw the Clovis nomination immediately,” they said. “Not only because he is a proud ‘skeptic’ of climate change and wildly unqualified for the position of USDA Chief Scientist – but also as a gesture to the American people that this administration is serious about rooting out the most hateful voices in our society”  Clovis is not a scientist, not science at all in his background.

The roots of ISIS date back before the Obama administration and Clinton being named Secretary of State. Though the group did not exist as ISIS until 2010, the fact-checking website Politifact ruled that the idea that Clinton is responsible for ISIS is “false.” It was called al-Qaida in Iraq in 2004, and then the Islamic State of Iraq in 2006, before turning into the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Unlike the establishment elites of both parties, President Trump believes that action talks and BS walks. Hurling a clutch of Tomahawks to degrade operational capability of a Syrian military air field and authorizing the first use of the Massive Ordnance Air Blast precision guided munition in anger against an Islamic terror tunnel complex each served a dual function: target damage and demonstrating to DPRK that Uncle Sam has grown weary of being played for a sucker with phony “frameworks” and “peace talks”.

Don't believe that, roll back to the 50's and 60's when we agreed to have nuclear-armed Bomarc missiles stationed in Canada. Fast-forward to any other time and you'll see that we did what we were told, and on the odd occasion we didn't (Chretien and the Iraq war) we were """"frozen out"""" by the US for a long time.  Resisting their advances for all of our liberal (big """"L"""", and small """"l"""") reasons will result in this set of negotiations ending badly for a long time.

NAFT included Canada the US and Mexico and sure we have see the car companies move there en mass as have there suppliers, so if the thumper get it stopped that will be good for Canada. But what I was watch was to see if JT would be a man and say look if Donald wants to talk NAFT next week we will have to put it off because all the representatives are not here. Nope he babbled on about nothing, stood for nothing and smiled every time he spook. The good news we only have to put up with him for 3 years the Americans got Trump for 4 more.  Sucks to be American. We can see where it is going Mexico oil or Canada oil I can only hope JT tell Trump he can have all the Canada Oil he wants as long as he pays the international price of 55 bucks a barrel versus 20 buck on a barrel made up in USA pricing.

0,"And to be honest, the media's infatuation with Trump helped the atrocities develop.  Trump has become a soap opera that the media has been using to gain subscribers or viewers.  Maybe he will go down as one of the worst Presidents ever but unless he commits a clearly impeachable offense, he will serve out his term.  The Trump-Media soap opera is and became a distraction from other newsworthy issues which are not just footnotes in history - this alleged genocide is one of them.  Good reporting from Saunders - glad the Globe's Editors are making this front page news and calling our attention to it.  The Trump Media soap opera has Jumped the Shark - time to put all his silly tweets and CNN's and NY Times punditry on page 2 (unless its a serious issue which has urgency) and pay attention to the many important news stories out there.

0,"OK. Clinton got more votes than Trump; the Liberals got more votes than the Conservatives or any other party. Agreed that riding boundaries result in seat numbers that proportionally represent the numbers of votes cast for each party but that's why PR would be a good electoral system, right? The Liberals not only won more seats than all the other parties put together (the definition of a majority government) but they also won more of the popular vote than any other party. Since to all intents and purposes there are only two parties in the US, the situation is not that easy to compare with the Canadian system.

1,"The Republicans (some reluctantly) embraced Trump as a useful idiot who would sign the legislation they expected a Republican congress to grind out. They underestimated not only his corruption, incompetence and instability, but also their own. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are easily the two biggest hypocrites and cowards in Washington, and perhaps in history (time will tell). Ryan and McConnell have a laser-like focus on one thing: taking health care away from as many people as they can in order to transfer the money to the wealthiest people in the country. They will abandon Trump when and if they determine that he is no longer a useful idiot but merely an ordinary idiot who impedes their pursuit of tax cuts for the wealthy. Trump could have terminated Comey any time before Comey announced the investigation of the Trump campaign. After that, the termination is what it appears to be: a criminal attempt to cover up a federal investigation. History will see it as a turning point.

What Trump says and does is irrelevant; it is the emotional energy and appeal of his gestures that feed the voracious psychic damage that Trump supporters carry.

The crew was speechless. The security team and the pope’s entourage were speechless.  No one knew what to say, not even the pope.

Perhaps he will 'lay low' until he can take power...but wait, he and his henchmen are few and Americans are 300+ million people What can we do? We can't look to the president to decide our future. We need to rebuild our sense of community--to work together. Not let ourselves be destroyed by anger, hatred or despair. Humanity survived most of it's time on earth with much less.

Trump tried to control his fate by firing Comey and putting Jeff Sessions in the DOJ job, but the cat is way out of the bag on this stuff and it will now run its course over the next months and, probably, years.

I believe the first and second amendments are equally important and Trump does too. He just does not think that the first amendment gives license to lie and neither do I.  The kind, respectful, fair and balanced manner that Obama was treated by Rush, Hannity, Breitbart and others in conservative media over the last 8 years?

Trump is too unpredictable, they are using NK to test the water as to get a real feel on him (they don't realize even the U.S. people is not able to get a real feel on him). On the surface, it seems that China is rising; actually, it is not as strong as you think mostly due to institutionalized corruption by all level of government from provinces to villages. The Chinese tourist who scoop up all the brand named products overseas only represents 15% of the population. The rest still live in poverty and discontent. Majority of their income is from export, and we are till their biggest customer. 50% of their top officials 2nd generation is living in the U.S. with majority of their wealth. They're still years behind us in military technology and they know it. I don't think China will start a war with us.

The ACA is sometimes called 'Obamacare' causing many to think they are two different things, and confusing those who have enjoyed health care through the ACA but scream for repeal of 'Obamcare'.

Remember what health care was like before the ACA, because that is what we will have if Trump and Ryan get their way.

Sooner or later someone will steal his returns and give them to the Washington Post. Then all the adoring Trump fans will blame the messenger.

It requires a deep thinker or as in Trump's case, a lot of experience and a altruist assertion. Especially in Canada which I believe is why The Rebel and Leitch failed. To mimic Trump up here is not how to sell the same message. To his credit, Harper was the ONLY one I've ever seen to successfully sell bits of cultural protection ever if he was fully on board with the multinationalists. Social conservatism in an age of weakened borders and assimilation problems is all but a joke which leaves Sheer in no man's land. And to try to compete with Trudeau (who is moving centre more) in a personality contest is surely doomed from the start. We don't have a populist movement up here and we may never. But to assert the progressive status quo with all it's unintended consequences by shooting down the free speech dissenters amounts to nothing but utter loathe.

At least the priest at the Mass I attended today didn't endorse Trump; he recommended a write-in.  When the history of the church in the United States during the first two decades of the twenty-first century is written, historians will note that some putatively ‘pro-life’ and ‘pro-family’ members of the church, including some of its clergy, disgraced those movements and embarrassed the church by giving the GOP a pass as it descended into right-wing ideology,  even to the point of rationalizing, justifying, even recommending a vote for the racist, fascist Republican nominee.

He also had a grip on the crime problem down there and new how to handle it, God knows Canada needs some Sheriff Joe Arpaio's.  God bless Sheriff Joe Arpaio and President Donald Trump. And God bless all of those that are coming forward to make America great again!

0,"People complain that liberals did not stand and applaud when Trump, for instance, called for clean air and water. Why would someone applaud platitudes mere days after Republicans actively reduced rules for keeping our water clean?  The tribute to the SEAL was emotional, of course, and I think it is fine to paint a rosy picture when the widow is in attendance. But afterwards, my thoughts returned to Trump saying """"they lost Ryan"""" (they being the generals) rather than acknowledging he had a role. Even uglier are the memes now circulating attacking Sanders for """"refusing to stand"""" even though he stood twice. Trumps goal may have been purely to honor the dead, but others are willing to lie about this just to score points.

0,"Looks like the A.P.

I will never trust the leftist media to tell the WHOLE truth about anything having to do with the Trump administration.

By such standards, you yourself outsource jobs every time you buy a foreign made product.  It is not clear that the richest will benefit the most from Trump's tax plans.  Under his plans a family of four will pay zero income tax until they make around $50K annual income or perhaps more if they have home mortgage deductions, etc.

0,"Predictably, another remarkably biased and one-sided column from a writer who is making a name for herself by relentlessly attacking Trump. Irony is usually not the strong point of such individuals, but, speaking of the way Americans treat each other, it may be worth reflecting on the blatant disdain and contempt Hillary Clinton and some of her many allies in the media and the entertainment business showed for millions of Trump supporters (remember the """"basket of deplorables"""" and many related comments?). The modus operandi of some Trump critics is to attack Trump, and sometimes his family, almost constantly and often unfairly, and if he ever responds to these attacks, then the critics intensify their attacks and claim they live under a dictatorship and other such similar utter nonsense. It is ironic that these critics can insult the President of the U.S. with impunity, while claiming he is a dictator. Even mild criticisms of authority in true dictatorships would have dire consequences.

0,"I notice several people claiming that Obama """"created this problem'. Well, to the extent that he signed an executive order I suppose that is correct, but the real cause of the problem lies elsewhere and has been a problem for 70 years or more and no administration has come to grips with the matter. Most """"illegals"""" are in the US to earn money doing jobs that Americans can't/won't do, for low wages and terrible working conditions that are still better than they would find back """"home"""" wherever that may be. The low wages allow producers, largely in agriculture, to sell food for less and make a higher profit in a cut-throat market place. Remove these people from the job market and prices will rise to the point that many more American and Canadians will not be able to afford fresh fruit and veg.. Trump's contribution to the mess is zero. He has provided no real leadership, he's just dumped the problem back on Congress with no guidance or direction. He's basically just said, """"not my problem"""".

Just an FYI...  Donald Trump is the only major political leader in power who is working to PREVENT a genocide!!! When Islam mixes with other religions (Christianity, Buddhism and especially Hinduism, etc.), there is bloodshed when the numbers of Muslims reaches a critical tipping point (about 20% of the population). When Islam reaches 40(+) % of the population, the genocide of non-Muslims begins. Donald Trump is striving to avoid reaching the point where either non-Muslims are forced to kill Muslims, or be killed by Muslims. Go read the history of India and Pakistan.

I said that Kelly the new chief of staff was already proving to be a strong leader of the WH staff and was jettisoning those who did not fit (e.g. Bannon and The Mooch) and would be bringing in those who did fit.  I did not indulge in Trump bashing because the focus was on changes in the WH staff and what this can mean.  As to being delusional, please indulge me by comparing the Trump and Trudeau cabinets in regard to relevant experience and accomplishments.  That should be a ton of fun and establish who is delusional on this subject.  Why not start by comparing General Mattis and Maryam Monsef?

0,"Trump has made plain how much he admires Putin and his form of government.   Putin has the kind of absolute, life-and-death power that Trump longs for, and our democracy may well be in jeopardy.  Now that Russia has gained access to our widespread computer system with no penalty, they will be encouraged to go further.  Witness the hacking of the Vermont electrical grid, and who knows what other systems already. Got a smart house, smart car, smart phone?

He's a career criminal, a filthy bigot, a serial adulterer, a prolific sex offender, a racist, misogynist and pathological liar; the most corrupt, incompetent and unstable person every to occupy the presidency; a clear and present danger to the United States and the world. His presidency demeans the office he holds and diminishes the country he leads.

The """"thing"""" that gets Trump upset is that he is being challenged;  challenged by a man of impeccable credentials, long record of distinguished service and a moral compass.  Everything that Trump lacks.  We may indeed go through another """"Watergate"""" down here, but today''s Republican Party is not the one on the 1970's.

0,"Linda, your point is a good one.  I must admit that I have doubts as to the extent to which I can believe what Trump says.  However, his list of possible SCOTUS picks and his selection of Pence as the VP nominee both struck me as affirmations of his words.  Still, yes, I have doubts.  Foreign policy is actually my primary field of expertise and there we clearly disagree.  While Trump's words were often careless and frighten me, I found the record of Clinton and Obama to be woeful.  Clinton supported intervention in Iraq, and was hawkish in both Syria and Libya.  For me the worst option is someone willing to intervene when tensions are high but lacks the commitment to stay and fix the problems when public support wanes.  Thus my fear with HRC, was exactly what we had with WJC, a hawish and violent policy, but no long term commitment to states after intervention.  Will Trump be better?  Here I have serious doubts.  But simply reimposing the Mexico City Doctrine will help much.

0,"as a die hard Trump denier, I believe it's all down hill for him now unless there's a significant terrorist attack that creates fear which he can exploit. TV adds using the negative goldmine he's provided will excoriate him until Nov. and wither his support no matter how he changes, and he doesn't have the numbers to spare, even against a weak and damaged candidate like Clinton who currently beats him fairly handily in (usually pointless) polls. I'm guessing he's going to avoid direct confrontations with her, like the rebuttal, and whistle past the graveyard as much as possible, he knows he's nowhere near her league in any one on one confrontation. He can't afford missteps from here on out, but he's a walking talking time bomb on a hair trigger looking for landmines, plus, the press is now against him from this week's flap over the reporter being called sleazy. When that flips against a candidate they're done, he's got few free rides left now and the media are circling the wagons.

Ronald Reagan used military spending not as a national defense program but as a method of job creation. It worked temporarily but it left behind one of the largest increases in the deficit of any peace time President. The increase to the national debit was 40%. Many of the costly programs were passed onto George H.W. Bush who in only four years increased the national debt by an additional 17%. Unemployment rose from 5.4 to 7.4 percent.

Always! Without them we likely would not have made it through the cold war era. The Democrats continually imply that Trump or people in his inner circle are somehow secret Russian agents working against American interests and it's simply not true. If America is to defeat our greatest threat (Islamic terrorism), Russian assistance will be needed just as it was needed to defeat Hitler in WWII. Not since Hitler has the world seen such evil, and as we did then the world needs to come together and wipe this Islamic terrorist scourge from the face of the earth. Trump is not wrong about that.

Too bad, because that would pretty much explain why Canada isn't doing a lot of huffing and puffing about it in Washington. And then it gets confusing. The author acknowledges the democratic failings of wobbly Mexican governments yet fails to connect that to the mass illegal exodus to the US which has resulted in Trump's Wall. Praise for the Canada's economic contribution yet somehow Mexico 'isn't feeling the love' from Canada. Mexican problems need Mexican solutions. Maybe her Canadian-educated kids have some ideas.

(3) A general disconnect and lack of organic link between the political class and its clerisy...and the general population. Brexit and Trump showed just how out of touch and disconnected the political class has become from ordinary people and their lives, concerns and culture.  All three points deserve much longer discussion - but in the meantime, have a look at the liberal (US sense) academic Mark Lilla's new book on identity politics and how it prevents the left from the most basic job of politics - common good and persuasion - leading to balkanisation and hyper self absorption along identities and to illiberal politics.

0,"So Gregor and the Vancouver City council attend and allow the flag of the brutal military dictatorship of China to be raised with dignity over Vancouver City Hall. Even wearing the red scarf which represented arbitrary persecution and unimaginable brutality of those opposed to the PRC regime.  Where were all these unemployed, low information protesters then?  Unbelievable how hypocritical. How does Gregor explain that?  I'll send Team Trump pictures of Gregor and the Vancouver city Council demonstrating reverence and deference to the brutal military dictatorship of China.

0,"The same crowd of snob-class Canadians who vote Trudeau in both admiration and expectation of unfair advantage will lap up this column  Reguly should criticize the corporate welfare  practices of Canadian governments that made  Bombardier a teetering mess instead of conjuring up the standard spectre of a chortling President Trump.

It is estimated that the US Fed Gov't spends 650 Billion / yr on sanctuary cities and Mexicans in the US sends back an estimated 26 Billion in remittances.  Trump no doubt also sees the complete and utter madness of the EU.  When you look at the migrant crime statistics in Germany, Sweden, UK it is staggering.  The amount of rapes in Sweden and gang rapes by muslim migrat economic trash is a disaster.  They gangrape women in wheelchairs, old women, young boys and even recently live streamed an episode on FB.  I love it how Japan is for Japanese, China for Chinese, India for Indians, Mexico for Mexicans, but White European nations for everybody!  No question Trumps push to stop immigration, ban dangerous muslim from sharia loving countries, and his push for more jobs will result in a mini baby boom for European people.  Why is it that White's cannot have a country of their own? I don't mine some immigration but not for welfare migrants and sharia

0,"Generally, if a person of either gender does not want to be touched, they should not be touched.  This is just a question of basic respect.  Now having said that, the real question is, given imperfect behavior, how bent out of shape to get over a transgression.  The answer of course depends on the severity of the transgression.  Forcible rape is a serious transgression (but still much less severe than murder).  Accordingly, serious consequence is in order.  I would have forcible rapists surgically relieved of all external genital apparatus or something equally severe and final.  I believe that long jail terms (except for murder) are cruel and unusual punishment.  So what should the penalty be for a superficial transgression involving no force.    A reasoned approach is to treat the offense consistent with consequence.  Trump has not been PC but he has not made serious transgression.  For individuals to allow issues to mushroom out of proportion to consequence is entirely irrational.

0,"For those that didn't click on The ZH report that I linked to, it references and is largely based on a New Republic article by reporter David Dayen.  Dayen's article has several links including links to work by reporter Matt Taibbi.  The CNN link I provided shows the absurdity of a network saying they have something illegal that only they are allowed to have.  Therefore, we need to wait for their version.  This type of arrogance when combined with many other examples of mainstream media corruption may have influenced voting among those who would never think to vote for Trump.  From Matt Taibbi's current RollingStone article, """"We journalists made the same mistake the Republicans made, the same mistake the Democrats made. We were too sure of our own influence, too lazy to bother hearing things firsthand, and too in love with ourselves to imagine that so many people could hate and distrust us as much as they apparently do.""""

0,"What you mean is that you cannot expect Trump and company to remember all their lies correctly. This is looking good, as in bad for Trump.

0,"I don't know if I would call murder an """"achievement"""".  It is lamentable, even if the person affected is a """"bad guy"""".  Every loss of life is something to regret, not trumpet as a badge of honour.  Shame on the Globe for such a callous title.

0,"mr loewy- sir, you have it backwards. How much more do you need? you're willing to hang clinton for some not proven, relatively minor things in comparison to Trump, who is making a play to pillage this country. he would love to model himself after putin, who started as an everyday KGB agent to become one of the richest men in the world. unfortunately for trump, and to our best interests. he just ain't got the brains or patience to play one on one with putin. trump is a liability. worst security threat we have. loose lips what's not to be alarmed about? the collusion between many trump inner advisors with foreign ties? the fact he divulges sensitive info to foreign interests,?.. the fact the man can't control himself? that he says one thing and an hour later he does a 180 and says the opposite?  the fact we haven't gotten a dam* thing done here except for deal with his dangerous nonsense. tell me what i shouldn't be concerned about? WHAT SHOULD I NOT BE CONCERNED WITH? PLEASE TELL ME.

0,"what do you suppose was the subject of the presidents farewell speech?  go ahead and give me a few sentences of a farewell speech without using """"I"""" in at least one sentence. give me a summary of the last hour you've spent this morning and see how many """"I""""s come up. i wouldn't bother  counting the word I in a speech...can you imagine how  many I's in a speech by  tweetingtrump (Twerp as i've heard is is secret service handle.) - the only thing trump consistently talked about was himself. i am so amazed at the tiny peephole some are afraid to look out.

0,"Trump's refusal to release his tax returns supports an inference that he's hiding something.  He could refute that inference by releasing them -- if in fact he is not hiding something.  I think the returns will be subject to congressional subpoena well before the impeachment proceedings begin.

0,"Just curious. What do you make of the discourse at Bill Buckley's National Review or Weekly Standard or other stalwart outlets of conservative advocacy journalism, who in their direct repudiation of Trump's responses to Charlottesville, now Barcelona, have echoed the - mostly woefully indirect but sometimes happily direct - chorus of repudiation by GHWBush, GWBush, Romney, McCain, Flake, Corker, Graham, Ryan, McConnell, Joint Chiefs, Kasich, Rubio ad infinitum?  In your first 2 paragraphs you so narrowly tailor the scenario that your observation becomes an uninteresting caricature of what's truly under consideration and at stake: Trump has invited almost universal, bipartisan censure because he diluted his own message of repudiation by further ramblings about the wrongs on all """"sides,"""" seriously failing to distinguish when groups were wrong ideologically vs strategically vs rogue actors.  Literal, ahistorical, noncontextual, fundamentalistic exegeses of Trumpisms bigly miss the mark!

1,"Trump acknowledged on Sunday that using the using the name """"Pocahontas"""" as a racist attack on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was an insult -- but he suggested that he would continue to do it anyway.  What an officious impertinent ass.

0,"The shooter tried to do with a gun what Maxine waters, Al Franken, Schiff, etc. are trying to do with their mouths. With the tone the way it is in Washington, especially against President Trump and his supporters, it's a virtual call to arms for unstable individuals. Once it all comes out, I wouldn;t be surprised if this guy doesn't consider himself to be part of """"the resistance"""".

0,"As a Trump supporter I couldn't be happier or more proud of Trump's great performance today.  This was the Trump we wanted and it was fantastic to watch him rip into the fakestream media and lay down the law.  The fakestream media has become a pack or liars, Liberal axe-grinders and establishment lapdogs.  Well, not all, but 90%.  They're totally disconnected from regular people and are not doing their jobs.  Trump was right to confront their lies and slander.  Do we even need the fakestream media anymore?  They're not doing their jobs, so what use are they?  The fakestream media should use this opportunity to rethink their behaviour.
"
0,"Hatred? Give a specific example of what you deemed hatred. A broad brushstroke comment without specifics is a strawman debate tactic. Give a specific example of how Trump's campaign was about hate, specifically racial hatred.  I know that the Clinton campaign wanted America to believe Trump was a hate monger--find an specific example of hate mongering as reported in a reliable media source.  Trump had thousands of employees--none of which publicly accused him of bias in the workplace. He has people of color in executive level positions in his company.  If you think campaigning against illegal immigration is racial hatred--you don't want to confront the truth. It is terrible that the vast majority of people who want to break our immigration laws are considered non-white--that doesn't change the fact that millions of people have broken the law and think there should no consequences to their behavior.  Even our forgiven sins have consequences that will come at judgment.

0,"In 1938 Neville Chamberlain made excuses for and cozied up to a brutal dictator that had killed off political opponents and invaded a country. What followed was WW2 and 80 million deaths. Today Trump is making excuses for and cozing up to a brutal dictator that has killed off his political opponents and invaded a country. Trump is firing or bullying those that question him and threatening those that stand in his way of an alliance with Russia. It is beyond belief that our President Elect trusts Putin's version of events more than he does our own Intel Community. First ex CIA Chief James Woolsey quits in disgust of Trump and now General Mathis is close to doing the same. What will it take for the GOP and the entire nation to finally see that Trump is a threat to our national security? Trump must be forced to resign or be impeached before he does irreparable damage to our country. I'm angry that our elected representatives have been silent on this critical matter. You should be too.
