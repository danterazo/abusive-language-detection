0,"Bubbles, You can read what I told  Tennesseeretiree  before you drifted in to the conversation.  Isn't it odd that no one, including any Democrats want to 'own' this lemon.  Even you think  Obama care is so bad  you want to just dump it all on to Trump.  Not a single democrat is admitting its 'not' a mess, are they?  That's what people do with stuff that won't work right, pass it on to the next guy. Republicans have held their hands out to Democrats only to have them turn their noses  up and sit on their hands  at every turn. They want nothing to do with it even though they created it. Well, Dr. Frankenstein had to take responsibility of the monster he created and so will Democrats.  They are not just co-owners but the creators of Obamacare and cannot quit-claim their way out of it.  Not this time.

November 21, 2000 •  	The Florida Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, rules that that manual recounts may continue and that the totals must be included in the final results. Court sets as deadline for certifying the election Nov. 26, a Sunday, or early Nov. 27.  December 12, 2000 The U.S. Supreme Court renders a complex decision to overturn the Florida Supreme Court ruling that called for manual recounts. The court said in the 7-2 per curium that """"Because it is evident that any recount seeking to meet the Dec. 12 date will be unconstitutional ... we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida ordering the recount to proceed,""""  I guess that's pretty close to the next day!

0,"The average Trump supporter has a household income of $72,000 which means they are not angry, laid off factory workers but solid middle class. The anger comes from the racist incitements of Trump and the mistaken belief that someone, somewhere, somehow is taking something from them. Also too the laid off factory workers need to take note of the fact that Trump used Chinese steel in the building of his Trump monstrosity in Las Vegas. He is a lying con man taking advantage of good and decent but naive and gullible Americans with his lies and deceits. I wish that Alaskans were capable of seeing that fraudulent man for who he is as the reason for their displeasure. Drove to Homer over the weekend and was struck by how few campaign signs there are for Trump even in right leaning Soldotna. More Trump signs in Homer than anywhere else along the way. An equal number of Lisa and Stock signs which was heartening to me. Margaret is getting her message out.

That is why Trudeau is only making general remarks and not ludicrous claims as Trump does.

All he did was his job.  The fact that the Judge who was appointed by Obama refused a jury trail says everything to me.  He was just doing a favor to Obama.

Germany doesn't have trade deals with any other country. The EU is a trade bloc and members of the EU negotiates trade deals that govern all member countries. After she returned to Germany, Merkel said that Trump said to her ten times that he wanted to negotiate a better deal with Germany and ten times she told him that, as a member of the EU, Germany could not negotiate a trade deal with the U.S. Apparently, Trump still doesn't understand that.

We should be spending money to build smart grids to integrate wind and solar; to develop grid-scale storage through large battery, pumped hydro and hydrogen facilities; to speed the introduction of electric vehicles etc.  Oil pipelines are so 20th century.  The danger to the water supply from the pipeline is one thing, the danger to the planet from continuing to emit greenhouse gases by burning the fuel that will flow through the pipeline is of a different order of magnitude.  As the Trump administration tries to ramp up fossil-fuel use we will have to engage in protests on a much larger scale.

"
0,"""""all the vile qualities by which alt-right has been defined"""" . Defined by who? You? 46% of voters voted Trump. That's a pretty good proxy for the American population: 46% supported Trump or weren't bothered by him enough to go vote for someone else. If your 40% number (pulled out of thin air) was correct you would be saying that 18.4% (40% of 46%) of the American population, 1-in-5 Americans, think racism, fascism etc. is okey-dokey. I don't buy it. . The Left well knows the power of a name. That's why the Left insists that groups it likes be referred to in the way the group wants but that groups they don't like must be referred to in the way the Left wants. . I notice that the claims about the Alt-Right don't seem to include being anti-gay anymore. That would be kind of difficult considering that Milo Yiannopoulos, one of its most visible proponents, is openly gay. His openly pronounced preference for black partners to whom he is submissive makes the racism charge a little dodgy too.

0,"Nick,  Trump often contradict himself from day to day, from sentence to sentence spoken or tweeted and occasionally but too often within the same speech or sentence.  Clearly, many of the persons nominated for senior positions in this Administration are expressing strong opinions on key issues in significant contradiction or outright opposition to opinions expressed by Trump or other nominees.  The interests, values and stated plans of the plutocrats and other financial establishment figures being nominated are diametrically opposed to those of the many lower middle and working class voters that voted for Trump and on whose support he is counting to press forward with his agenda, confused though it is.

0,"I agree with Trump that John Lewis should pay more attention to his congressional district and tens of millions of African-Americans he purports to speak for,  Lewis risked his life for civil rights 50 years ago, becoming an icon. But like other liberals, what has he done for anybody these last 50 years? Supporting corrupt unpopular oligarch, Hillary Clinton, for president was a big mistake. He and other elitist Democrats have only themselves to blame for Hillary losing the election. Elitist African-American organizations like the NAACP and the Black Caucus, along with tens of millions of other African-Americans, should have supported the highly popular, uncorrupted, progressive Bernie Samders. Tens of millions of blacks need a genuine progressive who believes in economic transformation, free university, free health care, and equality for all oppressed minorities, not the status quo Hillary or Obama. Furthermore, all the polls showed Sanders beating Trump by a wide margin.

1,"Let' be clear. Steve Bannon is the regent. Trump is the boy president. Bannon is in charge.  Trump does not care one way or the other about abortion or other issues as his changing statements show. He just wants to play president in his own reality show. He could as easily play Pope.  Google Bannon. He is truly a terrifying man. He want to destroy the state itself as his own words show.

England, Scotland, Spain, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark have no security issues with the United States other than they fear the US may not be as committed to Europe under the illiterate Mr Trump as they once were. Now ask Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Ukraine, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia how they feel about their good friends in Russia who held them at gunpoint from 1945 until the whole communist mess collapsed on itself around 1991.

0,"Yup, the media has a very hard time handling a President who does not have every comment approved by lawyers.  It is refreshing to see the normal pathways of human thought which evolve day-to-day.  The President is letting us see him as a human.  We humans react and equivocate.  Trump has cast off the false monolithic facade that the media expect.  I doubt that the media can handle reporting on real human behavior.  It is too complex for their regular routines.

It is hardly negotiating before negotiations start to lay out at least in a broad brush way what would be Canada's ideal agreement would look like. But for almost two years now, since Trump was elected, Trudeau has refused to do this. He has no clue what he is doing. By the way, what happened to the thermal coal duties on exports from BC ports?He told Christie Clark he would give that a good think and then it just seemed to disappear in a puff of smoke. Backing the duties would be a negotiating move. Actually, even saying he would think about them was sort of a feeble Mr Dithers sort of negotiating move.

We need the facts about this to help us survive Trump since the facts may show his election was manipulated by foreign operatives. (note to critics: all statements are speculative.

What he was bound by was the white supremacists being allowed to march, expressing their first amendment rights.  And, he could've said that he doesn't agree with them, but it's still their right.  Here he's suggesting punishment for peacefully exercising the 1st amendment rights, which is where he's falling down on his responsibilities as President.

0,"Absolutely right. This protest is purely an anti-Trump protest. And did Trump really call for the NFL to fire these guys as the article says? Well... not really. He said he'd like to see an owner do that, but that isn't exactly the same as ordering, requesting, or even suggesting to an owner to do that. He was't talking to owners. I think he was just expressing, using his non-PC rhetoric, that he felt the  protests were unpatriotic and pointless. The protests are the same as flipping off the country and all it's citizens. How does that help solve the problem? What exactly is the problem being protested? And what am I supposed to do about it? We have a media that has hyped up our emotions and is dividing us by digging these things up and blowing them out of proportion.

DHS “will not take action to remove active DACA beneficiaries. The transfer of information from USCIS to ICE would only take place where there is a significant law enforcement or national security interest.” Trump made clear earlier Tuesday that he wished to wash his hands of the problem, telling Congress to legislate a solution — “do your job – DACA!” Trump has a reputation for speaking falsely and breaking pledges.

0,"There's been reports the media have published of intercepted surveillance of Trump's team. (Narrative is usually Trump and Russian/ Putin ties.) It seems reasonable to look into whether this process was abused. German Chancellor Angela Merkel very publicly accused The U.S. of spying on her (intercepting her cellphone communications) and Obama's response was essentially that all countries have surveillance programs and do things like this. WikiLeaks released documents showing The U.S. spied not only on Angela Merkel, but also the leaders of France and Britain. It's not unreasonable to assume they would have also wanted to do this on Trump and his team. I don't see the problem with investigating whether this process was abused. Maybe it will show that not only did Trump and his team say and do some inappropriate things, but also that Obama and Clinton and The Democratic Party also did. Why not have an investigation? If there's nothing to hide, why hide it?

0,"Obviously haven't been following the issues, it's not about traditional left/right politics as much as it's about the damage globalism has done to middle-class lives, and now is the time for nationalism, starting with jobs, which have to go to people in their own country, not exporting jobs abroad or importing people to fill good jobs. So decreasing immigration and other foreign labor, imposing import tariffs in ways that benefit the home country. Don't get confused by political personalities or what the biased media spews out. Any politician that spews globalist policy ideas is out and irrelevant. The US exported jobs, in Canada we imported labor having the same and worse negative effects; in Canada's case, for too long have good jobs wrongfully gone to foreigners and excessive growing surplus of newcomers, because of bad globalist policy ideas not putting Canadians and Canadian families first. That's why Trump is relevant, Bernie was relevant, and other politicians are not relevant.

Maybe Trump's agenda will finally force Hawaii to consider the financial consequences of our poor decisions and actions ?  Like Hawaii just running up the credit card debt, Lawmakers forget that at some point in time the bill comes in the mail and you got to pay it. How much the rail cost now ?

1,"Rashi, no, the Senate had to first vote to pass SB-21, with our employees all voting in the affirmative.  Alaska voters then had the option of passing a referendum to overturn the law, but we spent almost $30 million dollars on a propaganda campaign to fool the voters.  The referendum (to overturn the law) was passed in many parts of Alaska- but we won- just barely, with the votes we received in the Hillside, Eagle River area.  This is bad for Alaskans, but very, very good for us.  It is in part why we gave Rex Tillerson $180 million plus another $54 million in cash after he left Exxon to become a lap poodle for Trump.

Less than six months later the DPRK signed the Armistice cease fire - - not a peace treaty which is why we are still technically in a state of conflict.  If this guess is true, Trump may well end this ambiguity by asking Congress to declare a state of WAR exists between the USA and the nuclear armed DPRK. To do that he must first get the backing of ‘we the people’ because, left to its own devices, Congress is sure to crawfish away from doing its duty AGAIN.  Ike's plain talk paid off: for the next 8 years there was not a single American combat death and Trump is aware of this.

It seems that has changed.  Higher education needs to change.  We waste millions on a system that is broken.  Everyone does not need or is ready for college. If you went to High School but need special classes to catch up, you should be able to SUE your High School for passing you along when you do not have a grasp of the material.  The same for Elem. Schools.  Many students should be offered trade schools because that is where their skills lie.  For some stupid reason we have not held Higher Education to the fire.  You should be able to SUE the college if you cannot get a job in your field after following the advice of guidance counselors.  The left wanted that to happen to Trump.  If the college and the instructors were held accountable there would be a change in education that would trickle down.

Firstly, average middle class Canadians, when they meet a poor person, don't know if he or she is gaming the system. They just know he looks ugly, shabby, and poor. But those who buy into society's official designated scapegoating of the poor tend to just see an unattractive poor person and tend to treat him less well.  Media used to talk about deserving poor and undeserving poor. But the average person cannot tell which category someone is. Now they are merely poor. They only see someone on the street panhandling and turn away or somebody who looks sick or strung out and turn away. So, yeah, that official scapegoating is hate. Absolutely. And finding someone repulsive and ignoring them is also hatred.  As for Hillary's hatred and society's hatred of Trump supporters, no not all are racists and sexists, etc., but middle class ordinary Canadians hate all of them. And the media encourages it.

1,"It would appear that other than Gizella, most G&M posters on this site have swallowed the 21st century High School version of the causes of the American Civil War like kool-aid in one Big Gulp. REALITY: the South was an Agrarian economy reliant on slave labour in order to be economically viable. The mythology of Southern White superiority was just that, a mythology built to support the slave-based economic imperative - not the other way around. The North was an industrial economy that had evolved to require free - or at least non-slave - labour, although indentured labour was accepted (Go figure. But after all, rember this is the time of Charles Dickens). Gizella is correct. Princess Alceste and the rest of the Greek Chorus Gals & Castratos are simply wrong.  The States War (Civil War) was, like most wars, was fought over economic imperatives. Slavery was very much a secondary, though critical aspect of the complex factors resulting in war.

Moreover, criticizing Trump doesn't mean giving the Dems a pass on their issues. Finally, I don't agree that the media has declared war on him. That really disturbs me, since it seems to delegitimize a free press, which is absolutely necessary to a functional democracy. And Twitter and blogs can't fill that vacuum - in fact, they are part of the problem (see the """"fake news"""" issues).

0,"I can't tell if President Trump is a racist or simply will say anything to get elected. But lets face it, many of his supporters are non-white. The message that resonated with them is the perceived loss of good paying, middle class jobs due to trade and the conjured up fear of immigrants - particularly those who don't look, sound or pray differently. This issue transcends race.  There is still much to celebrate for Black History Month in Canada. It is also a good time to take stock and focus on the work that still needs to be done. The repudiation by BLM of the Toronto Police force's participation in the Pride Parade was clearly a step backwards. And the apparent lack of engagement between some black communities and the police still needs patient relationship building. But all-in-all we appear to have a much more tolerant and respectful community than our American neighbors.

0,"My point is that it is illegal to lie and spread provably false claims [about the Holocaust] according to German jurisprudence.  Fixed that for you.  There's plenty of room for alternative facts, and even some pretty rank and dishonest alternative facts in German public life.  Der Speigel has been publishing since 1940, and in that 77 year publishing history, how many US Presidents were featured on the magazine's cover with a cross hairs on their head? Holding a bloodied knife and the head of the Statue of Liberty? Eating the world from space with  the caption """"The End of the World"""" in German? Were featured in articles in the interior talking about what would happen, politically, if they were assassinated?  I'm no fan of Trump, but given that all those covers, and that assassination article, were published within 15 days of him taking office, it's pretty clear the magazine took a hard left into rank hyperbole. Not even Nixon got that kind of treatment.

0,"Trump's tribute Ryan Owen was the most inauthentic part of his speech and was there only to exonerate his own bad judgment by insisting again the Yemen raid was """"highly successful."""" It wasn't. It was hastily planned because he wanted to show he was tougher on terrorism than Obama. Instead of going over the plan in detail in the Situation Room, he casually approved it over dinner. The raid was a mess, apparently because the SEAL team was detected. Owens was killed, a helicopter was destroyed, none of the targets were killed, and contra Mattis, it apparently produced hardly any worthwhile intelligence. Instead of taking responsibility, Trump as usual: blamed everybody else. He's implied it was Obama's fault. He's implied it was the military's fault. Otherwise, he simply claims that it was a huge success and only the FAKE MEDIA says different. His respect for Owens was genuine, but he emphasized the raid’s success just to cover up his own failure, and used the tears of a widow to do it.

Again, I've never seen Nazis and white supremacists so emboldened since Trump's rallies and his presidency made it acceptable. David Duke even praised Trump for his support of white supremacists' anti-American ideology.  Actually, I'm a reformed Republican since I figured out the damage of Reaganomics to our economy and the middle class.  I attended Catholic schools straight through college (where I minored in history), and then worked my way through a post-graduate education while starting various departments for an international corporation. I now have my own small business, and likely have paid higher taxes than you. I've voted Republican, Democrat, and Libertarian based on candidate's positions on issues of concern to me.

0,"This news report does a good job of reporting on the constitutionality matter of Trump's recent move on refugees, for example from Syria, to ban all Muslim refugees but to have a case-by-case basis review of Christians for possible admittance.  My prediction would be that a US Court judge (or Supreme Court) would likely rule against Trump. The establishment of religion clause of the US Constitution has been widely interpreted as providing a muscular freedom of religion, and a requirement for hands-off from government in he area of religious favouratism.  I predict that Trump does not have a leg to stand on, legally, with that part of his proposal on refugees.  I do note, however, the Globe and Mail was remarkably quiet about Obama's system, which reportedly took in massively greater numbers of Muslims than Christians from Syria (greater numbers taking into account the per capita distribution there, about ten percent Christian but refugees to US well under one percent Christian).

The Work Farce has been advocating for almost 50 years every policy Sanders has been advocating, from anti-racism and saving the environment to universal health care and affordable university;  social justice and equal rights for all. Only a political revolution and an economic transformation can bring more equality for women, African-Americans, the LGBTQ community,and ethnic minorities. More for Main Street, less for Wall Street. That's social democracy. The role models these 50 years have been the Scandinavian nations. Bernie calls it democratic socialism. That must have scared the middle class. Too bad.

Trump's proposals are similar, and would be as bad for the US as Brownback's have been for Kansas.  A push to moderation among the GOP would help neutralize some of Trump's most potentially harmful proposals.

1,"The meaning of the slang aside, young men are virgins and women pop their """"cherries"""" frequently with happy outcomes for all concerned. """"Daddy"""" does not exclusively denote an actual father but more frequently alludes to an archetypical, and let's be honest here, Oedipal desire. In my opinion, the name has more to do with eroticism than sexual assault which is not at all """"sexy"""". Dragging the name """"Trump"""" into the discussion is definitely something that kills an erection--especially the female variety. Clearly, many heterosexual men have boners for Trump.

That """"maneuver"""" was around one of countless TAX LAW created by Politicians!  And the NYT is actually congratulating Congress for passing yet MORE tax code to close loopholes in previous tax code it passed.  It really is incredible the lengths to which Leftists and their owned-media will go to cover for and perpetuate the Leftist mantra of more laws and more taxes.  If Trump is true to his word, he will dismantle the tax code and start over so that we don't have to tolerate this from politicians anymore.

0,"Part (1)  The “state of the race” continues to devolve. At a time when Trump desperately needs to expand his voter base, he is determined to shrink it. He has consistently expressed contempt for broad swaths of the population: women; handicapped persons; racial, ethnic and religious minorities; immigrants. Yesterday he reasserted his contempt for John McCain and Paul Ryan, in particular, and Republicans in general. His criticism of McCain provides a clear view of Trump’s hypocrisy: in Trump’s view, McCain is not a hero because he was captured; Trump “would not want to be in a fox hole with him.” Of course, Trump was never in a fox hole with anyone, having taken five deferments from service during the years that McCain was languishing in a Vietnamese prison.

0,"I think he does know in some general way that he's playing Robin Hood in reverse; but I don't think he could describe or defend the process and I am certain that he doesn't care about those he would hurt.  <Like Romney, he thinks that by being given a fortune by his father, he hit a triple.> Exactly; but I think Romney (like the Bushes) genuinely cares about people less fortunate than he, even if he has a hard time empathizing with them. I think it would be impossible for Donald Trump to care less than he does about the victims of his lies and broken promises.

That is my point, the left and right has gotten so stretched that we have such a hard time seeing one another's point of view and because of this you see such a ridiculous show of emotion trying to garner the true substance of what is being reported. Fair, equal, unbiased and truthful with supporting evidence is all I ask, not all these accusations, skewed points of context and inability to see both sides is what I am upset about.

While Fox News makes mention of the 97% and the 3%, they do so as if the """"competing points"""" were equal.  They are not.  Real journalists who can read and write know this.  I hope that they never cave in to the garbage that is Fox News.   And I hope the new ADN does not.  Likewise, when Trump makes up a story that is verifiable false, and declares everything else """"fake news,""""  I hope ADN does not cave in, and tells it like it is.

0,"Their dairy industry is subsidized, ours isn't.  When they remove all their payments to their dairy farmers we can talk about trade.  They removed the Milk Marketing Board in the UK, and they lost a fifth of their dairy farms last year, and expect to lose another fifth this year.  Entire communities are dying as the market is flooded with milk from Eastern Europe.  The consumption of milk and cheese is relatively inelastic.  You can drop the price but people won't buy that much more.  There is only so much people can or want to eat.  Our milk is the highest quality and it is reasonably priced, with the farmers getting the money instead of the fat cats who run the supermarkets.  A gallon of milk is cheaper in Toronto than it is in Aukland New Zealand, and the same price as a gallon in New York, if you add in their subsidies.  We should follow Trump's lead and slap a 30% tariff on any company that imports milk instead of buying it locally.

About 8 endorsed Trump.  Polls are often commissioned by the news media. Often the polls reflects the political agenda of the news media, not the actual mood of the voters. Trump's victory implied only one simple fact - utter rejection of Obama. But the media has painted Obama as one of the most popular Presidents but that too is based on the polls, not reality. Republican Party, long deemed to be dead and buried only a week ago, not only won the White House, control majority of the governorships, the House of Representatives and almost the Senate, astounded the Democrats by its resurrection from the dead. Once more due to the meaningless polls.

Further, in the wake of Trump's return to traditionalism - especially the overthrow of the evil consequences of the DNC's 1972 Conference, I see certain elements (but not all of) the pre-V2 Church returning, such as the overturning of the degrading effect of overmuch liturgical modern cultural contextualization of the liturgy which will lead to a return to the centuries-old ambience of the quiet Via Contemplatio in the Holy Mass, and thus a return to more Eucharistic Benedictions & Holy Hours. The world is aching for the Church to return to a more mystical, contemplative paradigm - the emptying of the pews is a direct consequence of post-V2 liberalization (+ of course child sex abuse).

Second is that after decades of gops/conservatives playing victim to their manufactured excuse if liberal media in the 20th century, they then created their own biased media outlets, talking heads etc in the 21 century.    So the idea that media is biased is true but they are cause as it seems like no one has produced more fake news and presented propaganda and rhetoric as news than the conservative media.  So for trump to turn around claim fake news is both partly true and at the same time completely hillarious watching him play the spineless victim who is the claiming he is the victim of a witch hunt while you have Fox News, bierbert and talking heads flooding the world with pro-trump propaganda and rhetoric 24/7.

0,"Jude Mahoney - Not a Trump supporter, but when you say Trump's nominees don't understand """"the mission"""", you're actually saying they don't support the mission of yourself as represented by the elites half of the country voted to get rid of.  There are multiple sides to """"the mission"""" surrounding just about every cabinet position. If you're an environmentalist, you believe the Interior, Labor & Energy departs should be """"on mission"""" to destroy the manufacturing and energy base of this country so as to prioritize the environmental concerns that you espouse. If you're someone who values having a job, affordable fuel & the ability to build a business, you believe those departs should be """"on mission"""" to develop sane environmental regulations and other infrastructure in order to prioritize your concerns.  You may look at those nominees as wholly unqualified to support YOUR agenda, while someone else may see them as well qualified to support theirs.

0,"That was a decent and honorable thing for Pres. Trump to do.  --- And, every one of the conservatives here on Washington Examiner MUST do the same thing and publicly offer condolences.  The LIBERALS all over the internet were *immediately* out front and center offering condolences and apologies about Rep. Steve Scalise, and denouncing that crazy shooter.  You have NO excuses to make about this situation and MUST offer apologies and condolences for the dead. Neo-nazism and the KKK is absolutely indefensible.

1,"The lies Trump told did hurt him, but Hillary is an even bigger liar so it hurt her more. It's not just the right wing who are dumb in America, it is both the left and the right, and their media is part of the problem. Too bad the author tried to twist the story into what he wanted.

Those who are protesting Trump aren't about the interests of the establishment.  And there's no moral superiority in the establishment in any case.  That proof is confirmed by each establishment member who endorses Trumpism.  Gingrich, a shining example of trumpery.

0,"argyle5663,  Great comment.  I'd add that 'being with the Americans on their terms' is potentially rather more demeaning & unrewarding than most of us are assuming (although the era of Trump should be alerting us to this dire prospect). We can't place our fate in their pocket & expect that we can control the negative aspects of such  To do so means a dispirited Canada reduced implicitly in practice (if not explicitly) into a neo-colonial relationship under which Washington dictates our foreign relationships and policy & the New York banks & Washington dictate our foreign trade & key aspects of our domestic economic development.  In short, we must face up to the dangers of being too dependent on US markets & defence arrangements & be prepared to assume the costs & effort of building trade & defence links outside North America.  This isn't anti-American; only assuming the burdens necessary to maintain a credible sovereignty & choice over our own affairs.

A president makes a haste-free decision because he doesn't fall prey to the moronic idea that humans have effected, in any mannerism based on tangible evidence or rational analysts, the earth's behavior. First it was 'global warming,' then 'global cooling' now it's so ambiguous that is 'climate change.' Newsflash - ain't nothin' different than it ever was. People freaked out when we had droughts, then they freaked out when we had floods. We've always had floods and droughts.... I don't really care for Trump, but I'm glad that he's pulling the plug, and across the board, on the U.S. financing the rest of the world. No more appeasing stupid emotions which stem from diverting the focus of making progress (ironically, progressives are really hateful of progress) in areas that matter.

He attracts a certain person that is not good at depth and prefer to see the world in a simplified narrative.  So yes, simpletons should be called out when they are being brutish.   If only we could have a test in order to vote it would solve so many problems.  How many Trump supporters do you think could pass a simple political ideology test.  It would have decimated the results.   You prefer to dish it out and then when it comes back you rely on calling people hypocrites because they would rather be nice but are now being forced to speak out because of the angry low effort cons.

The opening line of this article was """"Is it time to stop acting as if Donald Trump were an acceptable and legitimate national leader?""""  Are you kidding me?  Like him or not, he is the democratically elected leader of another country. Worse that country's politics is completely polarized. The last 20 years between Bush, Obama, and Clinton and now Trump have been full of massive partisan politics and wide spread attacking by each party against the other parties.  Whomever is in power by being elected is who we need to respect as their legitimate and national leader.  We dont need to bow down but we do no to trade and do business with them. Any province or Canada as a whole would find it appalling to have Americans tell us who is legitimate or who is allowed to be elected in our country.

I am dismayed by the efforts made by Trump, his lawyer, and his supporters to focus on one relatively insignificant aspect of the testimony as if it were a victory or a vindication, and to continue their signature deflection and distraction with falsehoods and insinuations regarding the Clintons - as if the actions of the former first family, whatever they might be, should excuse the outrages of the current president.

So, I would expect it to be in Fairbanks, too.  They wouldn't be well received there, so it's probably concealed.  Neo-Nazism, (the neo-National Socialist German Workers' Party with extreme racist and authoritarian views), and white-supremacy are likely to become overt, especially with Trump's nationwide tacit approval, the policy statement at the UAF to not tolerate neo-Nazis and white supremacists on campus is germane.

It never really got better, it just changed labels. It is certainly not my Great Grandpa ”Dad” Allen’s Republican Party. Dad’s descendents are pretty much ashamed of what it has become. Unlike after 9/11, when the Democrats gave Bush a free hand, the GOP gave nothing to Obama in 2009 when the nation was again in crisis. This is a defect of character.

Not only did he not deliver on the carrier fleet when promised, next he stated incorrectly in an interview that Korea used to be part of China. Koreans are very proud of their independence, their cultural singularity, their distinct language, and their origination of the only Asian phonetic written language. So Trump has insulted Taiwan, Australia, Germany and NATO, Russia, and both Koreas, all inside his first 100 days. Quite an accomplishment!

Those not towing the line are enemies? Be specific.  Its not a matter of being on the wrong side of history. Its a matter of using the Constitution as your guiding document and living with in its confines. You change the law, you don't interpret it differently to suit you as attitudes change. You don't discover rights that never existed. Woman's right to vote was brought by law, not a judge deciding it was a right denied. Slavery was changed by law and a war, not by a judge. The same thing could have happened with Gay Marriage. Calling it a right denied is a perversion of our constitution. It is judicial activism seeking an outcome.

Its telling that these two groups were not significant participants in these protest marches. Visual parsing shows that these were predominantly upper class females who could afford to travel to Washington where Trump only got 4 % of the vote.  Another very telling statistic. Trump got  42 % of the female vote compared to Clinton at 54 %.  This is a typical gender based expectation. But, among while female votes, Trump got 58 %.  These stats show that these protests were exclusively from the Democrat/ liberal elites. This group has done very well under Obama,( doubling their share of national wealth )  with the lower 50 % being left with most of the debt .  Which is why Trump got elected

0,"Carolyn,  There is no excuse for the vulgarity in that tape and I make no excuses for Donald Trump. But he owned-up to being the one who made those remarks and apologized. More than that, his behavior contrary to those words is well documented. Also well documented but not reported in the mainstream media is how the women who have heaped accusations on him in recent days have all been paid to do so by the Clinton campaign. So, who is worse? The one who admits their wrong and apologizes for it? Or the one who never admits they have done anything wrong, who has told so many lies that they are far past being forgiven their """"70 X 7 times"""" and who pays people to tell lies about the other while political cronies protect her from criminal prosecution?  Please, don't let the offenses of one blind you into overlooking the long record of unrepented sins by the other.

I don't see our idiot AG's two cents as being necessary or politically astute under the circumstances.  Between our congressional representatives, the Ige and Caldwell administrations taking every opportunity to criticize our President, our elected officials seem to relish the role of a kid at the zoo who goes up to the tiger cage and poke the tiger with a chopstick.

Forgotten is Putin's  motivation to destroy Clinton as a reprisal for  her criticizing   his own  blatantly undemocratic election...and she should never apologize for desiring free elections for the Russian people.  Slava Rossiya Svoboda! Also forgotten is the fact that the factions in America who benefited from Trump's election are largely those hawks and militarists who pushed for the American aggression in other countries, though certainly Clinton  herself had a hand in some of these.  In short, Trump's Putin-aided election will only mean an increase  in the sort of meddling being deplored here and I'm not shrugging it off..

If Trump's executive orders are against the law, they can/will be challenged. It's not a secret that the entire mainstream media got caught with their pants down with Trump's win and they are still living in denial (not the river). We're told it was a """"fluke"""" despite the fact Trump took long-held Democrat states for the first time since the late 80's and loud noises about the popular vote as if New York and California represent all the US (Hollywood certainly thinks so).

In regards to each one of those topics what the school is doing is putting forward the best understanding of each topic, with the goal of sending children into the adult world with a well-rounded education. It's a free country, and if you don't prescribe to a certain aspect of public education then you have the right to make alternative decisions. There aren't two sides to every topic, and ideas and knowledge are not a threat to values.  I'm not painting the public education system as perfect.

You can't fix a dam by not plugging up the holes and just removing water. If trump succeeds there it will be a an accomplishment. What I find funny is if obama deported so many why the uproar over trump continuing the policy? Next question if the USA has 11 million illegals and obama deported 2.5 million of the worst offenders does no one realize that is a huge number of serious criminals. Seeing as illegal crimes are still happening today what would the final number of serious offenders be. 3,4,5 million. You're hitting percentages of between 25-50%.

Complaining about the popular vote, or about the EC doesn't help matters and makes us on the left, just look like sore losers.  If we want to rectify this, we need to get enough Democrats elected in 2018 to make sure that he can't get anything done.

The national conversation now needs to turn to the more pressing and alarming issue - hacking by hostile foreign powers of our critical technological infrastructure. The emerging bi-partisan effort to get to the bottom of Russian hacking is critical, not to de-legitimize Trump's election, but to better protect our country going forward.  The greatest threat to America and our democracy is not a foreign nation. It is not ISIS, immigrants or illegal aliens. It is not the US government, the Left or the Right. We the citizenry are the greatest threat to America. True patriots must confront hate, anger, intolerance and ignorance to address the divide. People with whom you disagree are not the enemy.

What we the people expect of the President of the United States, what we demand of him, isn't about comparisons with somebody – anybody – else. He is accountable to the people and the laws of the land. And it's our duty, as citizens, to hold him to the highest possible standards. As we have for all the presidents before him.  Hillary haters, Obama haters: Donald Trump is president of the United States.  Defend the president if you will. Disbelieve the news accounts if you do.

None of the Trump children have any prior experience in government, politics, economics, healthcare, policy, law, opioids, diplomacy, international law, nor have any served in the military.

So despite Nazis and KKK marching and threatening to march and intimidate ALL those who don't look and act as THEY DO,  the Church's concern comes a little too late. Unless the Trump regime is publicly denounced in no uncertain terms and BLM is understood as a reaction to the shooting and defamation of unarmed Black Men, Women and Children rather than be blighly written off as a TERRORIST organization.

0,"Bannon isn't Trump. Trump also distanced himself from them during the election campaign.  The reason Trump did not specify the white supremacists as the source of the violence is that they were NOT the source of the violence: they applied for a permit to protest the removal of the statue of Lee and were granted one — a right defended by the ACLU when the mayor tried to refuse permission after it was granted.  While they came armed for violence, they had no intention of violence and video footage shows that. It also shows conflict arising when rival groups interfere. Had the police done their job and kept the groups separated, none of this would have happened.  Except maybe the car attack. But that was one man who is not being called a hero by the supremacists. We may not like what the alt-right is saying, but they had the right to say it.

0,"The Republicans have placed their collective heads in a vice and are tightening the jaws themselves.  They spent seven years posturing with pointless repeal legislation instead of working to fix this situation based on a false hope that the private health insurance model in place since WWII could somehow  be revived again after the ACA was implemented.  That """"revival"""" isn't going to happen because of the number of Americans now depending on Government Health Insurance ( Medicare, VA, TriCare, Indian Health Service, Original Medicaid, Current ACA and other plans).  Now they cannot repeal the ACA without producing the replacement Donald Trump promised.  I understand that if they can't save face in the next few days they will attempt to ignore the problem and hope Americans forget all their apparently false alarms about how quickly Obamacare is collapsing and the imperative to act quickly.  I have no sympathy for them.

0,"This is not a hate crime and the US has every right to decide who enters its territory.  It just so happens that Mr. Trump feels those particular Muslim countries at this point in time are possible risks for terrorist activities in the homeland.  I don't agree with his choice of countries (Saudi Arabia should be in there over Iran), but it is what it is.  If it was radical Christians coming from Canada to cause trouble in the US then I'm sure he would not hesitate to ban Canadians from entering.  Canada is predominantly Christian yet we likely would not see this as a ban on Christians.   I don't see that there is a ban on Muslims from Indonesia or Malaysia so this clearly is not a """"Muslim ban"""".

Where is your proof that DACA is blatantly unconstitutional when I can find nothing that it has never been challenged in any court. . Is this nothing more than miss information! . You would of thought that since 2015 when Congress was controlled by Republicans it would have been challenged then in a court of law but sadly I can find nothing. .

While accusing R's of all bad that happens in our country, they stomped on the feet and spirit of D's as well, at least enough in 5 or 6 states that gave the election to another who, well, does much need to be said?

0,"People who think using insults rather than argument in politics is a good strategy, hone in on whatever they think is their opponent's most visible and vulnerable characteristics. That is often their looks.  In the case of Trump, it is his hair and coloring. Trudeau, his hair and youthful good looks. Harper, his bland, boring looks, his stiff demeanor. In the case of many women, it is also often either that they are too good-looking, or not good looking enough.  The troglodytes who send threats of any kind are just that, but of course they won't send rape threats to other males, that would impugn their own masculinity. Is there any chance of any of them actually carrying those out? Of course not, it's all bluster.  When a male actually attacked a female politician, Pauline Marois, it was with a gun, not his p*nis, and not because she was female.  Remarkably, Merkel seems to have escaped such attacks, at least in English media, unless you consider her being called Mütter sexist...

Everyone was talking about Bill Clinton at the time, the idea that this poster wasn't - or that you could know that - are both ridiculous. What's relevant though is that Clinton faced impeachment for consensual sex with a staffer, whereas 14 different women including one underage have accused Trump of sexual assault or rape, and he has admitted on tape that he loves groping """"10's"""" without consent. So you're almost certainly wrong about your irrelevant attack on Clinton, whose crimes do not remotely approach the seriousness or depravity of Donald Trump's. For the lying, bigoted, serial rapist and fraudster to fire the AG is clearly a big, big step on the road to unrestrained authority and fascism, where the Donald is above the law. That, too, is *nothing* like what happened with Bill Clinton.

Colonialism drew arbitrary lines for nations in Africa and the Middle-East. Zionism contributed to the mass migration of Jews to Palestine the folly of the UN with mandated partitions of countries has not worked in Israel or elsewhere (e.g. Vietnam, Korea, Kosovo).

Or his ability to deport illegal aliens who overstay or otherwise violate their visas.  I still believe that SCOTUS will follow precedent and say Trump's ban has to be judged, just like every President before him who has ever 'banned' an alien or a group of aliens, on the document itself, not what was said on a campaign trail or in a news conference.  It will be ruled as a 'political question'.  Just like impeachment has been.

Lost in that discussion was the role of the media in joyfully printing information it knew to be obtained through some type of subterfuge.  We are still following that path and didn't learn our lesson.  We are allowing """"unnamed sources"""" to discredit our political institutions.

He's willing to dump subordinates if it saves his skin. I hope his subordinates understand that. They owe loyalty to Trump, but Trump won't reciprocate.

Yes, the politics of any President are going to be the subject of dispute and disagreement.  But, Trump presents a crassness, rudeness, dishonestness and disrespect of others that is simply off the charts.  In order for """"respect"""" to be given, one must be """"respectable"""".  I don't think Trump is.  He's a poor (if not the poorest - the nightmare) example of what I want and expect an American President to be.

Whether you or agree or disagree with his past actions is quite irrelevant to point that he (and pretty much everyone else) is making on this one.  The Trump campaign is under investigation by the FBI and is led by Comey.  Trump dismissed the head of the FBI.  Even if this was due to the Clinton email issue (which is belied by the termination letter which allegedly was all about Russia), then the timing is atrocious and the optics are terrible.

'fundamentally, Donald Trump is a nationalist — he's a kind of nationalist with a grievance. He thinks that the world has taken advantage of America for too long, it's time for America to be tougher and gruffer and more assertive and more selfish.'  So this is what we have.

Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Syemour Hersh, on the German news site Die Welt, carries the story further, reporting that Trump was “warned by the U.S. intelligence community that it had found no evidence that the Syrians had used a chemical weapon.” Basically, the impetuous an uninquisitive U.S. President  pulled the trigger without all the facts.

The truth is that violent racists and neo-fascists have been empowered by what they see as a weak White House both unwilling to call them out and potentially sympathetic at least tangentially to the white grievance agenda they foster...Antifa on the other hand, the democratic Left's worst possible friend is exploiting the Left's present disgust with the Trump presidency , to advance its own agenda completely opposed to state authority....both sides need and feed off each other

We have a lot of resources and integrated manufacturing supply chains that the US needs to help supply their economy and keep their costs cheap.  If they have to pay an inflated price to get the products the economists know that it will cause them a tremendous amount of inflation for the average consumer.  They are close to full employment, so companies locating to the US are going to have to start to increase their pay structures to lure employees, hence inflationary cost increases.  It's a gamble, but it throws the ball back in their court and shows Trump that we have a set of balls and we won't be bullied into making a bad business deal.

He was talking about how in years past, early voting numbers were heavily democrat and this year in most early voting states they are heavily republican. Megyn ignored his comment and again talked about how Trump was down and had a long way to go. Newt again talked about the 2 alternate realities and tried to talk about the early voting indications. Again Megyn ignored what he was saying and then went into the sex tapes thing. That is where Newt got a bit upset about the media concentrating on that for 23 minutes and devoting only 57 seconds to reporting about the WikiLeaks disclosures about Hillary.

Remember, no matter how you slice it more people wanted Hillary than Trump-- that is going to mean the kind of conflict we have. My hope is that Trump returns to his populist roots where he started and stop this Republican stuff-- like signing on with Republicans shrinking medical care and tax breaks for the rich.

""""there’s Haitians (who fear losing their asylum status) pouring into Canada"""".? Obama applied TPS. Canada eliminated TPS in 2016 for Haitians. So now it's racist for Trump to do what Canada and Obama did?  """"Mr. Trump avidly backed legislation that would sharply reduce immigration, bringing in a new skills-based system."""" Like Canada's? So now adopting Canada's system is racist?

0,"The time frame for the 1% is not immediate, it would be absurd to believe otherwise.  In my opinion, we could achieve said GDP over year end 2016 , ramping up in 3rd  and 1% in 4th year of President Trump's term in office.   By the way, 1) where did you get the .1% and .2%?  2) what was baseline (year)?  Like I said deficit reduction by GDP growth alone will not get us there...it's cut spending / """"fat"""" reduce the size of government.  RE: The tax cut.  Will be across the board.  Any prudent person would analyze the tax reduction impact and  could adjust their withholding to get more $ in their pockets to """"invest"""" (i.e. Roth IRA) or 2) use same analysis to increase before tax dollars into their 401K (tax deferred).  In my opinion, younger workers go for the increase in cash and roll into Roth...no wasteful spending.   As $ increases split between IRA and 401K to maximize investment ROI and minimize taxes.  This will be viable as long as we run the budget approval parallel to tax breaks.

The governor hired a contracted public relations team to convince Alaskans that we need to make choices. Reading some of these coments on this article, and others really makes me wonder how many postings are from this contracted team, or legislators themselves trying to sell their agenda on these comment boards. Once the government gets into the PFD it is gone like Social Security Fund poof! Once tax is started it will only increase. Once property tax exemptions are eliminated elderly and disabled veterans may loose thier homes. The most disgusting coment I have read is """"get out"""". Seems to be the republican catch phrase of late from Trump, to Gattis, to comments on these boards. Old and worked hard or disabled vets from serving our country, we have no use for you in Alaska so get out. I hope The majority of Alaskans are not of that opinion.

The Saudis, like other governments he'll meet on this trip, are playing to Trump's love of taking credit for the accomplishments of others. NATO and G7 partners have similar plans — flatter him with shiny objects, keep all speeches and presentations under 5 minutes in order not to tax his attention span, don't expect him to read anything longer than a page, and make sure there are lots of pictures — and don't forget the burned steaks and catsup.

So to claim the issue was """"silent"""" about all these situations is simply not true. She is not pointing out anything that has not been known for decades in the church. But since it was a convenient way to attack Trump, it was published here on Atoday.  Hopefully, no one who was a Christian would justify the life style of Trump or pretend it was a total non-issue. But we could and should point out that what Trump did while a private citizen building a self serving business, is no comparison to the Clinton's who """"raped"""" the public while in public office claiming to """"serve the people"""" of the USA.

0,"You know as well as I do that there were only some flimsy grounds for the mock outrage cultivated and directed at Ms Clinton. To get any substantial momentum behind the criticisms, it took a lot of rabble-rousing and false insinuations to embellish the actual facts.  So it is hypocritical now to say this is categorically false, and doubly hypocritical to suggest any outrage at the release.  It is a fact that the report was compiled, was in circulation, was discussed by intelligence, and that the president and president-elect were briefed on it. It is also a fact that it is unsubstantiated, and nobody is claiming otherwise.  There are no doubt many people who would like it to be true, but that is a separate issue.  So the release only addresses the question of what is in the unsubstantiated report? Should the public not be allowed to view this document? Who are you to censor what people should see or not?

If Putin continues his push to annex areas of Eastern Europe, he would quickly run afoul of the EU and lead to the collapse of NATO if the US simply allows it to happen.

If Trump walks away from the TPP and actively builds trade barriers in the Pacific Rim, then they will give China carte blanche to expand its economic influence throughout the region.  The US could quickly find itself on the outside looking in at the largest single consumer market on the planet.  I'm not saying this is going to happen.  These are """"what ifs"""".  However, the notion that every nation on the planet is simply going to bow to America's will is about 3 or 4 decades out of date.... and if that's Trump's strategy, it's likely to be a losing one.

His Opposition are part of the swamp, and are deeply invested in it's continuance.  As a television and entertainment personality, Mr. Tapper may have some value to his sponsors. As a biased, liberal, media personality, Mr. Tapper ...............  Let's put it this way: When I see his face, or hear him speak, I'm inclined to check my shoes, that I may have stepped in something.  Keep up the assault, President Trump

0,"This would make sense if Trump released the pressure off the American taxpayer a little by seriously decreasing Defence spending, a move that would actually force the NATO allies to pick up the slack. But his proposed budget contains massive increases in Defence spending. I think that the day the U.S. stops spending more than the next eight nations combined in the military, then we'll know that they are serious about having other NATO members increase their military spending.

0,"FYI.  Trump Inc continues under independent management during the presidency.  The Kennedys, Kerry, Feinstein, et al are very wealthy, but their investments are managed independently while they are in office.  If you have evidence that President Trump is doing something illegal and/or unethical provide examples, evidence, links.  Even better, concentrate on this theme's thread:  """"How to contain NK's nuclear proliferation.""""  It is a vexing issue.  If you could provide a constructive comment that would be nice.  If not, then why don't you return to one of the many President Trump bashing threads?  They won't be hard to find. The DP/WaPo/NYT/LAT and the rest of the lying progressive MSM provide an abundance of them.

As you pointed out Trump doesn't represent Christian values, Constitutional values, or Conservative values.  He was pushed hard by the DC establishment, the media, and low information nationalist voters.  I am very angry at these people for putting their selfish agenda ahead of the good of the country.  Since Senator Cruz dropped out, I feel like the election is already over and America is sentenced to another 4 years of darkness, deceit, and decline whether it is Clinton or Trump.  Both candidates are lying, self-serving, New York elite big-government progressives with little regard for rule of law, constitutional freedoms and the Christian values that America was founded on.

0,"We can expect a tax cut for Corporations, that will of course filter down to their shareholders.   We can expect a very large increase in military spending (we've been ratcheting up security fears),   Probably a direct cut in upper income brackets that will be pushed by 'fairness' of flat tax (which ignores all advantages of wealth).    In return we lose enforcement of environmental laws, a reduction in services for the poor.  A loss of health access due to financial segregation.  So it's clearing up a bit.   Standard ideology.   What's good for ownership elite is good for all Americans.    The distribution of wealth will widen between ownership and wage earners.   The financial industry will continue to grow in wealth by raking in fees and interest payment created by leveraged debt.  President Trump isn't reforming he's just going all in on modern Repubublican ideology.   He's a great salemen, the product doesn't matter much.  We'll see, nothings in stone.

That is so ludicrous it reflects a diseased mind.  Strike that: Trump's just a liar.  ***Warren Buffett made $62,855,038 Last Year*** By Jeanne Sahadi @CNNMoney October 12, 2011  NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Billionaire investor Warren Buffett in a letter to Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp Tuesday, revealed that his adjusted gross income last year was $62,855,038 and that his taxable income was $39,814,784. Buffett said he paid $15,300 in payroll taxes.  Buffett also said his federal income tax bill came to $6,923,494, or 17.4% of his taxable income -- two points he revealed in a New York Times op-ed in August urging Congress to tax the wealthy more.  Note: Trump's """"financial statement"""" is whatever he writes down. But a tax return is sworn to under penalty of perjury. Not REMOTELY the same thing.

I'll tell you why - guns  aren't being used by trained gun owners with a respect for life and guns, they are being used by gangs, criminals, with no respect for life, only the damage guns can do. Most of the time there was no two parent homes, just dysfunctional homes. No respect for education, just for what brutal activity can get them. No dad or other man in their lives mentoring them, so they turn to gangs for identity and validation. No one to help them find a purpose greater than themselves to strive for.  Funny that if these people in Chicago could use bombs and knives that they, you know, don't. They go with guns.

She does have a hard time focusing on things than need to be done to complete the projects she starts, finishing for her is tough, starting is easy and often her mind races. She gets irritable when things don't go her way, does things her own way and is often not into reality of a situation. Her deal is to keep going and keep creating, not having a real plan for completing her projects and let others around her take care of the details.

0,"This is getting very confusing now. Firstly, different elements in the country tried to overthrow the brutal Assad regime and triggered a civil war; and Russia backed the regime from day one. ISIS took this opportunity to move in Syria and tried to gain a foothold in the country. So the regime backed by Russia not only fighting against the rebels but also ISIS. Because of ISIS, we also gotten involved and formed a coalition with the rebel groups and the Kurdish. One one hand, we are with Russia against ISIS; on the other, we are against Russia by support the rebel groups. There are also voices from the White House to counter Iranian influence in the region. This is the first time that we actively downed a Syrian jet; with Trump's policy to give the Pentagon more leeway in responding to potential threats only serves to increase the likelihood that such encounters will happen more frequently.

It's the doughnut, not the hole, the glass is half-full, not half-empty, and it's a goblet, not the side portrait of 2 old hags.""""

Mike Coffman, a Republican “That’s what Obama did.""""  I have to disagree. It's the opposite of what Obama did. Obama did not seem to have an appetite to challenge the failures of the system tirelessly, and yet this was what he was sent to office with a mandate to do and champion for The People. I consider his compromises on non-negotiable progress to be the basis for his biggest policy failures and his administration's apparent inability to impart any lasting changes that could withstand willful vandalism from the likes of most uncivil and disingenuous Trumpist ideology and their regime's wildly radical illiberal destructive initiatives. Obama had a pulpit, he should have used it to proselytize for the left, which he simply would not do in many ways on many days. Trump is not so circumspect.

Of the two, HRC is the only one who has remained faithful to her original marriage vows, while Trump's broken all 3 of his.  Both candidates give Catholics reasons to be troubled.  But it's dishonest and lazy to fall back on """"my Catholic faith"""" as she does here.  If sanctity of life and the family matter, we can't selectively enforce rules against one candidate but not the other and be taken seriously.  And Trump mocking the disabled reporter signals respect for the disabled to her? Huh?!  """"I morally cannot vote for HRC. She is an advocate for Planned Parenthood and my Catholic faith requires me to value life no matter how small or old or disabled.""""

We were lied into the Vietnam war, not unlike how we were lied to about Iraq. We eliminated the draft to make going to war easier. Now we don't have to worry about mass war protests when all the troops chose to be ready to kill on command without question. It is also why we hire mercenaries like Blackwater.

After seeing America embracing the policies of the terrorism creating colonialism, foisted on foreign countries to enable the theft of Native resources and lands, as well as continuing the same policies against the Natives here, and seeing Americas acceptance of the sexual predator as a presidential candidate, I think America deserves everything it will get as a result.

Never the less, you are either ignorant of the facts or a straight party-line hack.  I think if Trump wins there will be an end to a lot of the political BS that has totally corrupted government and congress will keep him in check.

Mr. Kempton seems to have voted for him more by default because he couldn't bring himself to vote for Clinton. That's an important distinction.  There are an awful lot of Trump voters who were really anti-Clinton voters, and the Democrats would be wise to learn from that.

On July 28th we'll see whether 2nd quarter reflects strengthening or weakening of the economy.  The fact is that """"one week after Trump took office"""" has nothing whatsoever to do with anything Trump's policies do for the economy and rather than explain why you think it's strong, you ask questions that don't make much sense.  As with presidents before him, the economy for Q1, at least, reflects the effects of the previous president's policies.

Do you want to drive these companies away and jeopardize our own manufacturing overseas?  We have a global economy and it is not going away. Get use to it.

0,"I agree that the alternatives on offer are generally uninspiring, but that too was the case when Trudeau's Libs deposed Harper's tired regime. I would rather have Bernier leading the Cons and I see nothing compelling in any of the NDP's leadership aspirants. But governments tend to defeat themselves in this country. Trudeau's only accomplishments to date, like sort of getting along with Trump and a relatively robust but still fragile economy, have been achieved by default. But big minefields exist for the Libs on immigration, NAFTA and aboriginal affairs. On the latter issue, I suspect most Canadians have little interest in the models of aboriginal sovereignty proposed by many First Nations advocates. It will be almost impossible for Trudeau to achieve his vaunted new relationship with First Nations and keep the remaining 96% of Canadians mollified. And his broader predilection for identity pandering increasingly irritates many Canadians. The risks ahead are all Trudeau's to face.

0,"Yes. After one of the worst self-inflicted political months of Trump's campaign, and after a convention that was angry and offensive to many,  Trump stood even or ahead in the polls.  Clearly,  the trends are in his favor, regardless of the content of the headlines.   Most states are still controlled by Republicans.  When a veteran Republican loses, it is more often to a more conservative Republican than a Democrat.  The only trend that favors Democrats might be ethnic demographics, but it is unclear if this is growing fast enough.  Many of the spikes in Hispanic pop growth are in states solidly RED, so no help there.  We should not be surprised to see him win.   Only strategic and significant voter registration and turnout might change this trend.  Just enough Green or Libertarian votes will clinch it for Trump.

We want to keep the Hawaii program that has businesses get a tax credit in exchange for providing insurance at a group discount to their employees and officers that keeps our premiums well below national average.

0,"Thanks Paul, you are a kind-hearted and wise elder, which is what I strive to be.

And much, much more. I think my cynicism about Trump and the Republican caucus is well calibrated.  I hope I am wrong, but I really doubt it.

If modernization of airports is required, better consult with people like President Trump, who know how to build things on time and on budget.

When jobs continue to disappear from automation, they have no effective replacement for ACA, the rich just get richer, and immigrants continue to actually work and get jobs (how dare they!), there will only be self-reflection as the pendulum inevitably swings back to the Dems.  Until then, it will be morbidly entertaining to see the GOP actually have to perform.

0,"U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister May seem concerned with security and terrorism issues. They could lessen these issues considerably by following the common sense of the latest attacker - on Manchester. He is quoted as saying that he was acting because Britain had attacked Libya, Syria and other Muslims. Revenge.  It makes sense. One country attacks another and citizens and friends of the country that was attacked can be expected to strike back. All the countries which have been attacked, including US, France, Germany, Britain, Canada have troops fighting in the Middle East area. So it should have been no surprise that they were attacked.  Thus if countries took their troops out of the area, revenge strikes should decrease. No western nation has an obvious interest in that area, so little would be lost, and a lot of lives saved.  May and Trump could spend their time healing their very fractured countries, caused by Brexit and Trump.

0,"The federal government's jurisdiction over immigration law has consistently been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has overruled attempts by state legislatures to single out immigrants. Additionally, the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution is generally interpreted to mean that federal laws trump state laws, except for certain matters constitutionally left to the states. The open question is to what (legal) extent the city could and should proactively resist or cooperate with Federal initiatives. If the Feds want to hold/deport an undocumented immigrant, no city declaration can legally stop it. (As much as I might wish it to be otherwise). Individuals can (and maybe should!) choose to resist, but beyond working within the rule of law allowed within the Supremacy Clause, what are you asking for? Kim Davis was within her rights as an individual to refuse (and face punishment for refusing) to perform marriages-- but our gay brothers and sisters can still marry. (Yay for that!)

The vitriol and outrage about Obama for 8 years is no where to be seen with his base and it doesn't take any type of scholar to see the hypocrisy.  i.e. People flipped their lid when Obama saluted with a coffee cup in his hand.  Even his hardened followers can say that Barry should have been more procedural on that, but this man child's behavior is ok and passable?

President Trump has no bearings on researched facts or any positive outcomes relating to a country such as Iran as we all have seen his characteristic speeches on his foreign policies as well as national statements regarding US security.

He told Congress to do its job and pass a law to directly address the issue.  The DACA people are a sympathetic bunch and Congress should feel the pressure and pass a law to give them status.  Remember Congress makes laws that the President enforces.  Not the other way around.

1,"I am better educated than any of you left wingers and I voted for Trump as did most of my colleagues who also boast better educations than you have ... the idea that everyone who voted for Trump is a high school dropout sitting in front of his TV in his lazy boy watching celebrity bowling eating chili out of the can with his fingers was started by a progressive and then repeated by the rest of you in lemming like fashion. The uneducated, morally and ethically bankrupt left looked through their ranks and decided that Hillary Clinton should be their standard bearer and represent them as their nominee and four and 8 years ago similar searches spawned Barrack Hussein Obama ...the man with no grades and no birth certificate, a degree from a university where no one remembered him from and zero record of any accomplishments and you are telling the GOP they have stupid people in their party? Hahahahaha in 12 years obama and Clinton are the best you have and we are the dumb ones? hahaha

In fact, everything supports this except the MSM, you, the snowflakes, and the Trump-disorder syndrome people that are checking into their shrinks in record numbers!  Are you one of those people?  Melting snowflakes all over the place as you realize you lost with the just re-opened investigation of your babe, Hillary Clinton, by none other than the FBI!  You see, snowflake, they have everything on her now, the docs they just found and were hiding, are now going to court.  You don't hide docs unless they are damning.

0,"Michael, I've read the New Yorker article, and I suspect it is rather overblown. I figure Trump is a sitting duck for impeachment for conflict of interest at any time, if the Republicans were ever to decide to get rid of Trump """"with extreme prejudice."""" But, should it come to that, I'm betting his involvement in Azerbejan is very small potatoes in that process.  For greater concern in my mind is the report by the British spook that says Russia has material of blackmail quality on Trump. Russian oligarchs--reasons the conspiracy element in the back of my mind--would likely fall all over themselves to lend money to Trump. From their perspective, Trump would have been an excellent avenue to invest in solid stuff in the West, preserving their wealth should things go belly up for them at home.  Whether we ever find out depends entirely on how far and how long the Republican majority in Congress is willing to let Trump lead them by the nose.

Despite of Progressive and Conservative ideological divide, trading partner and allies relationship remain with the U.S.  On smart foreign diplomacy, alacrity and pragmatism, Justin Trudeau can learn from British Prime Minister Theresa May.  It's pure foolishness to drive headlong into Trump's tornado headwind to jeopardize our political capital,  putting our worst foot forward  before we even start negotiating NAFTA

0,"The """"Economist"""" noted that the liberal left had to stop talking to each other and start thinking why so many voted for Trump (and stop simply dismissing them as stupid, that just digs them in).   Much as I dislike the man there is a lot of legitimacy to many of the issues he represents (not all however).   The same forces can take over in Canada if we do not pay attention.   Remember that the voters who we would have judged as NDP supporters were the ones who put Trump in power.....so the pipe dream that NDP voters would support a Liberal over someone like O'Leary is as flawed as Hillary Clintons dream of winning the Rust Belt.   Just being Liberal or Progressive may not cut it on the next go round..   Learn from history or be doomed to repeat it.

0,"First of all, the one thing I like the most about the editorial is that the Trumpeteers cannot get it deleted for putting the finger on the blister like they do with some of my posts.  Second, I am reposting what they have managed to delete at least twice today but in my view is a BIG fact. Here it goes again.  When the SCOTUS overturns decisions made by several lower courts, that tells me that justice is not blind. And when Trump declares Qatar a terrorist country and a few days later sells them $12 billion in weapons, that tells me that his travel ban is NOT about terrorism either, but rather about something way more politically incorrect.  Oh, and let's not forget that Trump depicted Mexicans as rapists and bad hombres. They will be the next ones he will be picking on.

The fact Flynn was in Russia and on their payroll for speaker fees in 2015 and then was one of Trump's most outspoken supporters, and then got fired for 'lying.'  The fact Trump himself encouraged Russia to continue the hacking HRC.  The fact Trump was out in front about voter fraud before he even had the GOP nomination.  That struck me as odd unless it was a false flag diversion.  The fact he won't release his taxes.  The fact his son admitted in a European conference that Trump Inc. had a great deal of Russian money coming into finance various projects.  The Steele dossier.  The fact Trump is now apoplectic in denying any Russian connections at all.  I think it's dangerous to pretend none of the above exists.  The intelligence community must agree because they are moving forward to get to the bottom of all this smoke.  I am not going to be surprised that when the get to bottom, they find a bonfire.

0,"Trump has a bad habit of bluffing-- bluffs that he cannot really do. It may come from business where old style negotiators would  walk out of a negotiation-- often loudly asking someone to shred all the notes and agreements after he leaves. But that does not work in a situation like the Aircraft carrier that wasn't there. In this case threatening what sounds like it might be a nuclear attack if NK """"threatens us"""" is a bluff which he cannot carryout-- we are not ready for it militarily and Congress (Republican leaders) have said that attacking and invading North Korea and going to war will require approval of Congress.  NK knows this is a bluff and they immediately mad a threat to send rockets to Guam knowing that Trump is not pepared to do anything. The Asian tradition is that only losers bluff-- if you are strong you never need to bluff. There is danger that getting into a battle of bluffs with NK will lead to war, delay to the advantage of NK and kill negotiations.
"
0,"This is a difficult dilemma.  Much of the conflict moving forward in the future will be in the cyber realm.  As wired as the US is, a well coordinated cyber attack could be as effective as an all-out military assault.  So do we take our cyber weapons away from the government while other countries develop theirs?  Trump wants to spend an additional trillion dollars on our enormously bloated military budget.  But the next major war is far more likely to be fought with bits and bytes, not with firepower.  Military drones and mortars can be used against American citizens just as easily as against enemies.  The reason they aren't is that we have strong civilian control over the military (at least for now).  Eliminating our cyber defensive capabilities is idiotic.  What we need to figure out is how to prevent them from being used against Americans.

Were you not able to pray or say Catholic prayers? Not able to attend church because the state has shut it down? Not able to get into the country for a visit because you were Catholic? Or perhaps your ability to discriminate against others has been hampered by our laws? I feel sorry for you, a Trump supporter. How do you reconcile your Catholic beliefs with a lying, cheating, trice married, P grabber? Everything the man stands for not in the best interest of the church. OR the US. Catholic discrimination was rampant  in NYC  in the late 19/early 20th century. My grandmother told me what Irish Catholics endured. I see no evidence of that now.

0,"Trump has only three objectives:  First, remove any trace of Obama's Presidency that he can find. To that end he'll sign anything coming across his desk that would repeal 'Obamacare' - no matter how many million Americans it would hurt. Unfortunately for him the GOP controlled Congress hasn't sent him anything yet.  Second, amass as much personal wealth as possible. To that end he'll use the privileges of his Office to the fullest extent possible.  Third, return to an era when he believes that 'America was great'. To that end he'll play to the race card by continuing to promote views of the white majority above all others - no matter how divisive.

Today the press says the President's Bush condemn Trump, the Gop condemn Trump but both articles also say """"although they never mention the president by name"""" the press just assumes they are condemning the President personally, while the articles just condemn racism and hate.  Trump has denounced racism and racists, plain language...I watched him say it on the news.  What the press is inferring is he's lying and maybe the Russians are helping him cover up.  Maybe you should ask Mazie or Brian to pass a law that anyone who believes someone is racist should be allowed to take whatever action they deem necessary without fear of retaliation.  Like the left feels empowered to do now with the cheers from the press.

0,"The 1861-65 American Civil War was between Washington and Lincoln, slave owner and Harvard educated Lawyer.  Lincoln rightly won because newly industrializing America needed labour free to move rather than slaves tied to land. That most of slaves were black is irrelevant - the war was was not about race. But the deeper social contract was never updated. Are founding fathers still relevant? America unwisely thinks yes, freezing its Constitution and tying its own hands with history.  Today, we are at the dawn of another Era of Globalization where Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are defining a new world with NSR/OBOR, land based routes rather than sea, and new global institutions. This New World Order needs people, goods, and money freed from national borders, so do we need Obamas with their TTPs and sea lane grabs or Trumps with their walls? If America continues to fight the old war pitting Washington and Lincoln, it will be left behind.  Any lessons for Canada?

You can wax on about his behavior as nothing more than that of a competitive businessman, if that makes you feel better.  I will keep my own opinion that Trump is sociopathic narcissist.  I will also acknowledge that does not make me feel better.

Clinton's email scandal, no big deal, but Trumps sarcastic barb at the scandal, outrageous.  What it was was FUNNY!!!!  The DNC blames the Russians for the hacking of their emails. Anyone with half a brain, except for a lefty journalist, can see the comment for what it was- a sarcastic poke in the eye at Hillary.

0,"Perhaps there is a landing spot for this deal but it would require the Liberal government of PMT to take a little water with their wine.  The landing zone might look like this, a place where PMT and Freeland give up their non-starter demand for progressive social principles to be woven into the agreement; where we negotiate for ourselves rather than tread water with the lead weight of Mexico; that we finally give up our insane insistence that supply management in dairy and poultry production are sacrosanct.  In return we might insist that the Americans give up their nonsensical restrictions on softwood lumber and their demand to dismantle the dispute mechanism.  This degree of compromise could in turn give rise to new areas of agreement in the area of high tech and IT which are of considerable concern to both countries and pave the way for an overall agreement.  Yes Trump is being doctrinaire and uncompromising, but then so is Trudeau and until someone blinks there will no deal.

0,"I fear that Trump will create a power vacuum. The GOP leaders complain he is unable to focus on policy for more than a few minutes. So he will be preyed on by those willing to act and wanting power. If he wants to be just a figurehead and motivator, then he needs to choose the managers of the white house with care. Bannon is not that choice.

0,"""""mainly because the Trump administration appears to have left science by the wayside in policy-making decisions"""" There are many things called """"science"""", and there are fundamental differences. If you are referring to """"climate science"""", just because someone has doubts about it, does not mean they are anti-science in general. People on the other side of the [anthropogenic] climate change argument have as much respect for chemistry and physics as they always did. They also recognize that many of the statements made in support of [anthropogenic] climate change are actually anti-science. For example, you often hear """"climate change"""" supporters using phrases like """"scientific consensus"""".  Science is not consensus.  In fact, the history of science is one of heretics upsetting consensus. Going around saying that the Trump administration is anti-science because it does not support your particular interests is unreasonable and misleading.

So much of what they say is not positively pier reviewed by the major scientists in the filed.  It is a bit like asking Fox News to present science about Climate change.  There is a whole lot of Cherry Picking of sources.  I agree with you that the Guttmacher Study was inappropriately quoted in the determination of Hillary's veracity.  Like Trump, many of his supporters  cherry pick their sources to try to attempt to show facts that are misguided to say the least.  Reminds me of the scientists that worked for Phillip Morris.

This is in preparation for full air strikes to build a No-Fly Zone over Syria. Such a No-Fly Zone is necessary to launch ground invasion into Syria and overthrow the regime. Take over the country. One more Iraq.  2) With China president Xi in town, Trump want to demonstrate to Xi what he is capable. That he is no Obama. He is ready for war. First with Syria that will include Iran and Russia. Then he is ready to strike North Korea. He want to show Xi his war on North Korea is decided. That Xi have better butt out or war on China too.  Trump is betting he can wipe out Syria and North Korea without drawing Putin or Xi in. If they intervene in Trump's war, then he will blame WW3 on them.  So get ready America. Either Trump a hero who conquer two more countries, Xi/Putin back off. Or look for a bit of mess in America.

Reasonable people can believe that in the context of 1861 Rebels were fighting tyrannical invaders.  Most Rebels were not slave owners and had no interest in the institution of slavery.  They just wanted the invading Yanks out of Virginia.  2) You obviously are against the US Constitution and do not believe in the rule of law.  Communists, nazis, BLM, antifa, WWW with the appropriate permit have the right to assemble to express their views without being attacked. The disgusting KKK/nazis had a legal permit.  The cops should have protected them.  The cops didn't.  3) Google 'Bishop James Duke Chicago' and you'll learn about the black movement to remove statues of great Americans.  4) The cops were there in numbers.

I feel strongly that those you would like to elect do not have the money to do so, we are left with the privilege in office who because of their money they have not a clue what the real world is like, nor care.

Statement #2 - Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says the Liberal government will make a “substantial investment” in the military  Of course Justin, our hyper-partisan sock puppet, just caved to the Donald and wasn't man enough to own it.  He sent in another junior MP to do the heavy lifting for him and blame Trump for Justin caving to Trump.  Can you spot the Justin lie?

However, liberals want to ignore those six words and have made citizenship automatic to anyone born in the U.S., even children of the Russian ambassador.  This issue has never been heard by the Supreme Court, but it most likely will be in the next year or two because Trump made an issue of it during the campaign.

So we're paying about a million dollars to clubs that don't allow everyone access, for starters.  2. By allowing open primaries, you would get a ballot that allowed you to vote for whoever you thought was best...not just a party-line ballot. For example, maybe the best person running for Senate in the primary is a Republican, but the best person running for the Governor is a Democrat. With an Open Primary, you could choose who is BEST for the state, not just a party.  As it stands, you don't get to choose outside of the clubhouse. It's Party over Country. That's ruining us and it's what brought us Hillary vs. Trump.  Most of us feel that is not a future we want for ourselves or our children.  Let the best people be in our government...not just the most devoted party members.  Open Primaries in 2018

It is very insulting to republicans, and they are very quick to denounce the group(s) for the very reason you see happening here. Trump is not a racist, but they are pushing this narrative as if he were the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. It is very divisive and inflammatory, and does not get to the root of our problems.  The media is painting the alt-left as social justice warriors who have moral superiority and are fighting against racism. Today they are looking at the Charlottesville event in isolation. If you look at the whole picture, and look at everything they've done since the inauguration -- the violent protests, smashing storefront windows, burning limousines -- you can see they are not as nice and innocent as the left treats them. Not once has this behavior been condemned.

"
0,"Read the story. Trump clarified his position and denounced the Nazi and White supremacist racism that drove events in Charlottesville-- he denounced Nazis and White Supremacists-- like everybody else did-- virtually no one in the country supports Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, or any similar groups that are anti-non-white and anti Semitic. For some reason Trump is slow to denounce these groups, but I think he figured out that people will desert him in droves if he looks like he is supporting groups like that and their racist and violent tactics.

When he should have been practicing the 'art of the deal' in the week before the vote, he took off to the back end of nowhere for a rally just to hear the applause he so desperately seeks. When he spoke to House Republicans to get their votes he was uninformed about the specifics of healthcare reform. ('Who knew that healthcare was so complicated?') And when he failed he blamed the Democrats for not going along with his plan, even though he never reached out across the aisle.  There's a reason 'The Art of the Deal' was ghost-written. Trump knows little about deal-making when he can't stiff his contractors and investors, and where he can't just declare bankruptcy and get a do-over.

0,"I believe your hypothesis is correct. Trump is becoming a lame duck Republican but I disagree that the American form of democracy is showing cracks. I believe it is working exactly has the founding fathers had wanted it to. The system works best through consensus. It restricts presidential power, congressional power and the power of the courts.  When a nutjob like Trump gets elected Congress can, had does assert itself (e.g. Russian probe, Russian sanctions, ObamaCare, etc.).  I would not rule Trump out. If Dems get majorities in Congress I would expect Trump to push through an infrastructure package, tax reform and other items that Dems can get behind. He will rationalize and say he is """"making deals""""  - even if it is not the conservative agenda he hitched his wagon to. Remember, Clinton got a fair bit done with a Republican congress.

Have those concerned been actually improving the vetting procedures while waiting for Trump to finish twitter venting about the judges and the courts? - Improving vetting should not wait for grand standing in the east wing of the public housing on Pennsylvania Avenue.

If attorneys were in charge of america, this would be pretty much the same result-- people arguing about the cargo of a ship that is heading into a hurricane.  I stand behind Mr. Trumps ability to lead america, and believe his election is ordained by God over Ms. Clinton, because of her aggressive support of the execution of the unborn imprisoned in the womb.

We support the newly formed Islamic regime in Africa in Somalia and Djibouti and have sent additional troops there (Mattis' visit there shows our interest there). We support Islamic regimes in Iraq, and in Afghanistan and in all these areas, the Secretary of Defense has requests from the military for more troops, including thousands more in Afghanistan to bolster the 9,000 troops already there.

But just to be fair, you do know that Trump being a Nazi-KKK right wing wannabe is bit of stretch, considering that he got a daughter and three grandchildren who happens to be Jewish?? Your lies is proof enough of your own hate.

I see Flake and Corker's recent epiphany similar to trying to wash the poo off your shoes after you have stepped in it; there is no doubt you stepped in it, you just don't want to smell it forever.  But you know what the better route is?  Watch where you walk so you don't step in it.  Here, the recent about face does not change either Flake or Corker's legislative histories.  From obstructing Obama to supporting Trump during the campaign to rubberstamping Trump nominees (think DeVos) and Trump judicial nominees, the stink from the votes they have cast will never wash off and will have long-lasting negative consequences for this country.

It's pitting different groups of marginalized poor people against each other, and that includes the blue collar white males Trump pandered to in his presidential campaign.  As long as white poor people, too many of them white males, think they are somehow in a 'different' form of poverty from other classes of poor folk, Trump wins.  Poverty knows no racial, gender, or religious differences.  Unfortunately, some people think there is their kind of poor, and then there are all those others takers, not like them,  who are just milking the system.

But trade, which is really just globalization stripped of social justice adornment, is never finished, not when there's money to be made. The globalists aren't real happy about it hence the propaganda campaign. Without the EU,  lonely and  isolated Britain will wither and die. Isolationist America will be hiding under the covers while China ascends to dominance. Oh please.

What I really liked was CNN even gave her the questions prior to a debate, and Mr. Sanders still took it all the way to the convention, no matter how much the Dems and their cohorts in the mainstream media biasedly cheated Mr. Sanders.  I don't support Bernie Sanders, but in my opinion, he was probably the most honest man in the race, I don't think his supporters will easily dismiss what the party did to him. Many Dems want to gloss over it, I don't think they can.   Also, got to love Ms. Clinton's tour. When you cheat others, and you still lose, that says a lot in my opinion!

Clinton's silly statement that she was under sniper fire still resonates with the anger implanted in gullible brains. Face it, a lot of Americans don't like smart competent women like Warren and Clinton, it makes them resentful when anyone is better educated and more talented than they are. That's why the poorly educated love Trump, a man of ostentatious and glitzy wealth who seems as ignorant and crude as his adoring fans.

By any fair and impartial judgement, Hillary Clinton was by far the better, more experienced and smarter candidate, and despite the twenty-year effort of the far right to smear her, ethically she is pretty clean.

Next year, the U.S. International Trade Commission is going to rule against Bombardier and uphold the penalties. It doesn't matter if Boeing also gets heavy government subsidies. The massive penalty shows it's politically motivated by the Trump government who sees an easy way to please his base.  The American courts and system are always rigged to favour American companies and people. For example, Iran has been found guilty of the 9/11 attacks and been ordered to pay billion of dollars of compensation even though there is no evidence of their guilt.  At this point, Bombardier should try really hard to sell to other countries. Forget the American market because it's closed off for the next few years. If there is any manufacturing of Bombardier parts in the United States, shut them down and move back to Canada.

0,"Well, it is technology; in the days before iphones and computers people were not readily accessible and those who chose to work excessive hours either by chance or for career advancement did so.  There was a certain ill advised push when labour pools were excessive, as now, that enabled employers to coerce employees to work longer hours and this will never change but it has little to do with technology.  Instead of keeping employees on the end of a wire they kept them in the office working long hours.  I have never seen a job at any level that required constant work, save when there was a crisis in a department or in a company, that had to be addressed.  Once done reasonable hours were maintained.  Right hiring, proper training, proper delegation, clear objectives and oversight trump the number of hours worked every time.

The only meaning that makes sense is that he was trying to type  """"coverage"""", so the only question that makes sense is,  """"Why did he not succeed in writing that? Does he get drunk at night?

On the other hand authoritarian leaders have made police part of enforcement of political policy.     We can let the room argue that one.  From my perspective President Trump hasn't completed any of his stated objectives.    *I should say I  do not like the person Donald Trump, and while I try to stay objective in policy, I find it hard to ignore the Presidents  self centric view of the world and his demeaning comments on others far less powerful than him, (money, gender, culture, race, probably in that order).

Like Obama whoever Trump has around him will determine the outcome.

Trump has been quoted that he has known Jeffery for 15 years and that he is a terrific guy. There was a case against Trump and Jeffery from a Jane Doe that had witnesses. She dropped her case from getting to many death threats. She was 13 years old when she was raped by Trump.

But when a large segment of another country believes them and is willing to damn everyone who voted for Trump with silly actions that is worse.

Well we don't need Britain if we stop acting like an empire instead of a republic.

In my view his actions suggest that he does anything, purports to believe anything, says anything that serves his narcissistic ego.  When he needs to do something racist to win support, he does so. When he needs to feign non-racialism to win support, he does so. A racist has a principle, albeit an abhorrent one. A racist believes that something false is true. Trump has no principles whatsoever. He does not put any value on truth or falsity. He is worse than racist.  He is a total egoist / narcissist.

Among other things it involves reading, something Trump refuses to do. It was easier to just oppose everything Obama offered. They definitely didn't want their base to think Democrats care about them. They know their """"poorly educated"""" base of white folks that elected them are too ignorant to follow the money. That is why Trump loves the """"poorly educated"""" that elected him. Trump has made a very good living abusing people, particularly the """"poorly educated"""" and he is not changing.

Now it is true that a higher court could rule otherwise, but until it does it is correct to say a  judge found that the EO did not meet constitutional standards, and that is the law of the land and the precedent for future courts.

Sadly, far too many prelates spread the lie that abortion is the most important issue, when sadly there really are no viable proposals to change the status quo beyond harrassment. That these bishops buy into this nonsense in support of the Republican coalition generally and Donald Trump in particular is shameful.  The Governor and Control Board saved the bondholders from themselves. They only think short term. If they actually learned from history they would not keep making the same shameful mistakes and would quit resisting Dodd-Frank.  Trump is a creature of right-wing fake news, both as its subject and because he consumes it as his source of truth. This is beyond insane.

It's not looking like he will do either, let alone anything else productive.  I'm ready for President Pence.

0,"In the endless debate about the Russian role in the election we can lose the real reason HRC did not ascend to her god ordained position and lead the western world to progressive nirvana.

The famed """"blue wall"""".  These are are same people who voted twice for an African-American POTUS with a middle name of Hussein.  Before they suddenly became, according to the MSM, drooling bigots. Trump hired Kellyane Conway, a brilliant pollster, who recognized this opportunity and went to work in these rustbelt states.  Hillary seemed to prefer swanning around with her tech sultan and celebrity friends in places like California where she received lots of affirmation and could never lose in any case. Who knows why?

Instead of pushing the exact same policies like he has been off planet the last few years it might better serve to recognize the merits of these policies are only justified when they are a benefit that is inclusive to all not as they have been - benefits for some at the expense of others.

Charles Taylor worried that the postmodernists could undermine the liberal state without positing anything to take its place. Taylor and people like Allan Bloom probably never suspected that the real threat would come from the right.  I believe that the legitimacy crisis of the state and the abandonment of the idea of the """"public interest"""", meaning the common interest of all, on the right has much more to do with neo-liberalism than any mysterious infiltration of postmodernism into the empty craniums of the know-nothings on the right.  Whatever the origin of the current crisis, it is understandable that postmodernism is today in doubt because the choice is that either progressives reassert universalism or they have to agree to play in the same mud puddle as people like Steve Bannon, Trump and Stephen Harper.

You can construct any fantasy bubble you like but it won’t change the fact that Donald J. Trump is your - - REPEAT YOUR - - president.  Perhaps it is time for you to revisit your Epictetus. He was as you may recall the Greek Stoic philosopher who made clear that for a person to mature he must first recognize the difference between what he controls and what he does NOT control:  “To Epictetus, all external events are beyond our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens. However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline.”  Growing up can admittedly be especially difficult for those unfortunates who childishly cling to comforting mythology, but you really ought to give it a go.

In fact, if we are to believe the Bernie Sanders faithful, she is basically a Republican.  At least that's what they all tell me when I blog about the election.  I have been called a DINO, a sell-out, a Republican (gasp), because I dare support her over Bernie Sanders.  Did I mention I consider myself a liberal Democrat.  If we are to truly stop Donald Trump from sending us over a cliff, at least consider voting for Clinton.  I do believe she is practical and would be willing to work with Republicans, especially if she were to get some GOP support in the election.

0,"On further reflection, Trump IS a good example as to whether people will VOTE for an arrogant candidate. But, the similarity breaks down in that Trump has not been elected - YET.  And of course, has not been re-elected. Then we have the Eugene problem. In Eugene, we have 26% registered Republicans. Of the ballots cast, Republicans made up 28%. Trump got 66% of that. So if I am reading this right, he got 65% of 28%, or 18% of those registered voters. All candidates were on the Mayor ticket. Of the total registered voters,  57% cast ballots. Vinis got 29% of all registered voters. I am not sure if I have these numbers correct but I have to leave.  Because of our left leaning populace, people prefer the liberal """"arrogance"""" to the conservative arrogance. But I don't think people will vote in an arrogant leader.

As the article points out, the majority of NATO countries are below the 2% mark.  So, he is absolutely correct.  Appears his demand on NATO will be to meet the 2% target ....... a target established long before he was on the political scene. Same with Trump's comments on Japan. He wants Japan to do more in terms of defence ..... something the current Japanese PM would likely support, as he wants to strengthen the Japanese military.

Governments hoover international and domestic communications systems for intelligence, and then share it with their allies. There's no torture involved, obviously. So nothing will change about the vast majority of Canada's secret sharing, should Trump decide to use torture.  Second, unless the USA reveals that a specific piece of information was gleaned through torture, how would a Canadian spy agency know? If fact, Canadian spies DON'T want to know. That way they can receive the information without concern for violating Canadian rules.  Remember, it's not law that Canadian spies can't use information obtained under torture.

0,"Michael, as I'm sure you realize, shouting at Mr. Trump from a religious website is not going to accomplish anything but make someone feel good. The question now, as it is with all presidents on one issue or another, is how to get his attention and let him see that it's in his and our best interests to take climate studies seriously. That question is made infinitely more complex by the people with whom he has surrounded himself and there doesn't appear to be a path through the congressional leadership.  So how do we get his attention, besides using clever metaphors on websites he doesn't read or respect? There appear to be a small cadre of people who have his ear and also listen to public opinion. I'm not sure Jared Kushner is one, but he has an increasingly powerful role in the Administration. I think the better part of valor would consist in pursuing whatever pathways remain open and making a reasoned case to the people who can help. Yelling is not a strategy.

The Times did report before the election that the F.B.I. was investigating claims about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia – an article that resulted from an extensive reporting effort. The Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails were public, their authenticity was not in doubt and they contained newsworthy information.

He can hit SKorea, Japan, China, Russia, Hawaii, Alaska, the US mainland, NY, Europe.  Need I say more?  Only a fool lets him continue with this crap.  He is also working on an H-bomb, which is 1,000 larger than Hiroshima.  Do you think Japan doesn't understand what that means?  We all do.  He has to stop or be stopped, and it has to happen soon.

Indeed, about 2.5 million such individuals were deported. ....and you're right, those of us """"on the left"""" did NOT criticize that action.  Were President Trump continuing that very sensible policy, I guarantee you, I wouldn't complain.  The Trump policy is an agressive """"round up"""" of individuals who are undocumented....regardless of whether they have committed a crime (other than the """"crime"""" of lacking documentation) or not.  This includes individuals who may have been in the U.S. for many years, paid taxes, and possibly are contributing more to the welfare of our country than those individuals screaming for their deportation.

0,"Would there have been an investigation of Mr. Trump if Hillary had won the election? Clearly not. Would the Justice Department have prosecuted Hillary for the e-mails under Obama's presidency? Why did Mr. Comey investigate, find evidence of malfeasance, and then decide to make no recommendation to prosecute? Why did the U.S. Attorney General not follow up and do it anyway? This witch hunt is all because Hillary lost and was supposed to win, and got help from the FBI but complained at the time about their investigation.  The investigation is because Mr. Trump won the election, pure and simple, and would not be taking place if Hillary had won.

I also admire most of the civic values you stand for. It's interesting that two people can look at the same thing and come to two completely different conclusions. Some of the very things that you hold dear is the very reason why I did not support or vote for Donald Trump. You, obviously, see it a different way. I guess that's what democracy is all about. Let's hope that Trump, his appointees, and members of Congress have enough principle and integrity to put the welfare of the country above that of personal gain.

For the next 50 years, muslims are going to have to live with the consequences of that silence - much like Germans did after the fall of Hitler. What started with Brexit, continued with the election of Trump and is now going to spread globally - with Europe being next. America's backing of Wahhabist Sunni Saudi Arabia and the resultant Obama / Hillary destruction of the middle east has been a total disaster.  All western nations should stop all relations and trade with all Sunni Muslim states (starting with Saudi Arabia) until all state sponsored backing of Wahhabism ends. It is not Muslim extremism that is the problem, it is Conservative Sunnis that are the problem (and that is a huge problem) - they dislike Shia Muslims just as much if not more.

We were making sure everyone was comfortable with their pronouns and checking white privilege and uncovering the entire patriarchal white supremacist systemic superstructure in all the institutions of our country and government. Can't start letting the wrong things become normal...Who knows where we'll end up?

0,"Tragic.  I dearly hope the victims make it and recover fully.  Sadly (but predictably), we already see finger pointing and overt politicization of this tragedy.  The demonization of people with different backgrounds, religions, political or social views is disgusting and as we can see, can have grave consequences.  We constantly see this from both liberals and conservatives, including from their so-called leaders: Trump calling the press """"the enemy""""; Hillary calling Trump supporters """"deplorables"""".  Sickening.  Many politicians as well as liberal and conservative media outlets have been whipping people into a frothing frenzy for decades now. The rhetoric keeps getting fouler and is driving crazies out of their hidey-holes.  We need to stop this madness.  Get out of your political echo-chambers, stop patronizing the radio talk-shows, political blogs and pseudo news sites.  Go talk to someone on the other side of the aisle.  I guarantee you have more in common than you think.

They are the minority party but have to perfect opportunity to state a platform for Americans to consider  - health care, immigration, taxes, etc. But their ONLY platform is to get Trump, one way or another. They play the tune of the far left wing of the Dem party completely disregarding the rest, leaving support from REAL Dems and possible converts on the table with their obsession. They’ve got an opportunity to make some headway but are squandering it away. Quite pathetic and very sad.

People with well documented OBEs. Issues of precognition. All kinds of stuff going on; look into it. General supernatural activity of course doesn't specifically prove Christianity, but it puts theism into the realm of possibility, and should be a motivator for any sane person with a self-preservation instinct to seriously investigate Biblical claims, versus the Koran/Buddha/other beliefs. Clinging to the false comfort that nothing supernatural exists doesn't change the problem that we all die and at that point it's an issue we can no longer dodge. To not investigate is simply intentional, willful ignorance that we do have accountability for.

As with conventional war, the innocent will inevitably be the ones to suffer the most in such a scenario.  I doubt the charge that Trump colluded with the Russians will turn out true. But his unwillingness to concede that he was the main beneficiary (albeit an unwitting one) of their meddling is problematic. I think his actions around this issue, including the firing of Comey and his skating perilously close to the thin ice of obstruction of justice, are mostly a matter of ego.

It is clear that, for the CIA-man's firm, it is normal to present people as gifts and give up those who seek protection.

0,"To date, it appears that the Trump campaign team acted inappropriately but that (a) proof that inappropriate actions were by (or authorized by) Trump personally are lacking & (b) while inappropriate, such actions were probably not illegal.

0,"Trying to label Trump as anything """"political"""" or party affiliated (e.g. Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green), or even ideological, is a fools errand.  He's not even a particularly good businessman, if you analyze it.  He's a Narcissist.  It's all about getting narcissistic jollies.  Look at what we've seen.  A normal, healthy, intellectually sound individual simply cannot say and do the inflammatory things he does (all those things, racist and violence inciting in particular), and then become such an effective """"grandpa joe"""" as he portrayed during his second post-Harvey visit to Texas.  Then factor in the absolute world existential risk(s) he's taken with NK.  The problem is on full display, if you think about it.  He turns on what gets him his jollies, only for the purpose of getting himself jollies.  The persistent problem is that what gives him jollies is only good for him, not the country in """"hit or miss (badly)"""" fashion.  We'll never be able to know or guage what . . .

0,"You mean like the video that didn't exist showing Rob Ford smoking crack with drug dealers.  This is following exactly the same path as that tragedy.

Where there is smoke there is fire and while both sides are desperately trying to suppress the smoke my guess is someone in the CIA has a copy of the material which can bring down this President.   It is only a matter of timing.  They need to allow Trump to make a few more serious gaffes and then the facts in the dossier become 'live'.  The other strange thing is the guy who helped out Ford, Daniel Dale , is now a Washington, DC correspondent for the Star.

If there were nefarious doings in his childhood, no doubt the media, who uncovered the infamous alleged  Romney haircut incident would have found it. What is known was he threw spitballs and erasers, passed notes and talked out of turn at his previous school. Not exactly headed for juvenile hall.  I have a friend who is the most law abiding, rule following person you will ever meet. He went to military school because it was a rigorous academic institution that had been attended by generations of his family.

Trump's Tweet threat for Comey to keep quiet smacks of desperation, because if Comey testifies under oath in Congress that Trump told him to 'pledge loyalty' and squash the Russian investigation, BOTH Republican and Democratic Congressman will have no choice but to start an independent investigation, similar to what was done with Nixon and Watergate.  It would be ironic that Trump tapes his conversations like Nixon and they become evidence in the investigation that latter is made public.  Bet some of the conversations are revealing as Trump wanting Tic Tacs for his breath or grabbing a woman be her poo say.  His Comey Tweet threat might actually be a self fulfilling prophecy of Trump actually getting impeached and himself getting fired as President of the United States.

0,"Dai, the decision to defer the mission was not because it was too close to Trump's inauguration; it was because the best date was after Trump's inauguration, and since it would be on Trump's watch, it was the right thing to do.  Previous reports said the raid's objective was to seize computers and other communication devices which intelligence agencies believed were being used to communicate within the terror network.   It was an appropriate mission.  Post operation reports from DOD say """"mission accomplished.""""  There also were reports that the Islamic terrorists may have been tipped off by Muslims participating in the raid and were waiting for the raiding force, but we may never know.   The mission was planned entirely by the Obama administration, so I do not understand how anyone would see it as supporting Trump's political agenda or ego.  With regard to Trump mentioning Owens and recognizing his widow, I believe it was to extend to them the honor and respect of a grateful nation.

1,"Clinton emphatically supports a pro-choice approach to abortion; there's no way around that. However, she also supports a wide range of economic and social policies that promote health and wellness, that save lives and discourage and in fact reduce abortions. Trump pays lip service to the pro-life rhetoric that he adopted about five minutes before he decided to run for president, but promotes and advocates policies that promote sickness and lead to deaths -- including to more deaths by abortion. It's an Orwellian abuse of language to use the term """"pro-life"""" to describe Trump or the policies he advocates. In the end, it's not the rhetoric that counts; it's the results: and Trump's policies will quite literally kill people, including by abortion. Cf: The Parable of the Vineyard. """"Snowflake"""" again: an infallible sign of a fragile adolescent ego (M or F? Who knows?), sloppy thinking, lazy writing.

The media didn't paint the ugly picture that is Donal Trump's personal values.  He created them, he lives them, he exposes them with his every action and comment.  You may feel they're """"fine and normal"""".....your comments seem to imply they are.  However, more and more Americans, especially conservatives and other Republicans are saying """"no, no, no....this man does not represent our values or our Party.""""

Trump also knows how to build things, like a great wall so tall, Mexicans can only get over it with a long rope.  He is an expert at ecommunication so when he feels the need to tell the truth to the people he sends a series of tweets that will unify and inform his base  but also put his enemies on their heels as he effortlessly manuevers the field of 140 characters.

Should republicans have done the politically correct thing and sat back and done nothing , allowing democrats to pay the price for this terrible law they forced on the American people ?  It's insane rabid talk to suggest republican's want to kill millions by letting them die in the streets because they have no medical care.   The simple fact is that the average working class guy can't afford medical insurance thanks to Obamacare's sky rocketing costs . Democrats , by their steadfast refusal to be part of the process , are adding to the problem.  How dare they , and you , accuse republicans of being people wanting millions to die. Those who are being hurt by sky rocketing medical costs want Obamacare ended---those getting free medical care want the free ride to continue .   You are right about one thing---the revolution has begun---it did the day American's elected Trump. That was a clear message to both parties.

The reason that President Nixon was ultimately held accountable was that there were  Republicans in the Congress at that time who were women and men of integrity; who, as the facts and the evidence came to light, put country above party, patriotism (rightly understood) above personal interest.  As Trump embarks on the process of folding the presidency into his family and his corporate empire, he is well on his way to forming the most corrupt government in history.  At this writing, it's difficult to see any Republicans who will have the courage or integrity to object. I hope I'm wrong.

Antifa recently issued a statement proclaiming that violence against Trump supporters is justifiable. They have convinced themselves that they're protecting the world from """"fascism"""". In their minds, they might as well be the WWII French Underground striving to free an occupied Western Europe from Hitler's notorious Waffen SS.

0,"This points in this article are well presented and I agree for the most part, yet it still seems that the process of reconciliation of nations within one country is not linear and scientific, that the creation of a wider social narrative in the service of reconcilliation always contains fact and fiction, which motivate and serve the agendas of the day. Some charismatic leaders spin lies to allow their electorate to engage in retrograde behaviour (see Trump). Others produce charismatic art, which, even though perhaps at a remove from academic truth, adds to this narrative by inspiring people to imagine the 'other' and move closer to a progressive reconciliation and understanding.  It would seem Boyden's 'lies' have only been in service of 1st Nations issues.  Surely to insist on probing the murky depths and process of a novelist is to remove what was otherwise a positive addition to this narrative and turn it into yet another divisive act in a long and painful process.

I know from experience that some preachers tell their congregation that you have to believe in god to be a good person.

Her pandering to minority & ethnic groups was a turn-off also. Americans are fed up with the identity politics of the Democrat party. Compare her campaigning - with that of Trump - 7 days a week, hitting 4-5 towns/cities daily...he worked his butt off.

Leaving aside your anti-Trump silliness, of course we should pursue as many promising new trading partners as possible and make free and fair trade deals with them.  This is precisely what PM Harper did despite being roundly criticized at the time by Trudeau and other Liberals.

Probable cause of a crime is required.  The curious thing is that this might lead to a Congressional investigation. The Republican Congress won't investigate Trump's Russian ties, but they might investigate Obama. But that would open the door to asking about Trump's Russian ties. Perhaps what the intelligence people wanted to  happen all along.  Trump should have taken John Dean's advice and stopped trying to cover up. It's the cover up that'll get Trump in the end. It's clear the Trump campaign was in bed with the Russians. Questions need to be answered. Trump can't tweet his way out of this.

Not drunk enough for each to look good to the other but no other choices. Yes, the Democratic establishment is also corrupt with partisanship blinding their ability to choose because the money making machine based on hate for the other party won't let the people decide in open elections. Our political process has been hijacked and Trump won on that. He saw the party ignoring it's voting base with calls of trickle down, the rich are job creators, corporations are people. His solution? It's immigrants, terrorists, the Japanese, Chinese, fat women and female anchors who have """"blood coming out....everywhere"""". Now we could argue who is worse: Democrats or Republicans. Go ahead, it's a good distraction. And I'd mostly agree re: Democrats. The Republican party may not survive. That's social Darwinism.

In all interviews the announcer agreed that Trump had incited the violence. Then CNN repeated that news cycle over and over. There wasn't a shred of balance. It was relentless anti-Trump editorializing.

I would expect FOX to be pro Republican and MSNBC to be pro Democrat but CNN has historically taken the middle road (other than war reporting, which is blatant cheerleading regardless of who is in the White House).  Wolf Blitzer made me sick to my stomach.  When Trump hosted the media at Trump Tower you could see Blitzer wandering around looking like a ghost in the hallways.  I'm sure what was on his mind was, """"Whoops.""""  I found it comical that during this election cycle, the best most objective news I could find was on FOX.  Everywhere else was a smug smear campaign against Trump.  FOX is not regularly known for their unbiased reporting.  The irony was deafening.  The MSM, the Democrats and Obama are missing the key part of this """"hacked emails"""" narrative.  Clinton and the DNC used private servers not owned by the US government.

The funny part after the election was democrats never said Russia leaked dishonest information---they are mad they leaked the truth .

All that he has or will have done in his term can be undone by the next sucker who thinks he/she is right. Trump is not to blame for low population growth. The cause for low population growth is greed. Greed on behalf of corporate investors wanting more return on their money. That and governments who cannot be fiscally responsible with yours and my tax dollars. Do you see prices falling? No!

With the number of verifiable, yes verifiable lies that Trump has told since he took office, there will be something to get him on.  If he continues to antagonize the Republicans, they may very well be willing to vote to remove him from office.  The end result would be Pence, who in the end is more the type of Republican that the party folks would prefer.  Pence knows politics and isn't a buffoon.  Those on the left need to be wary about impeachment as Pence in many ways would be worse for them, as he could actually get stuff done as opposed to Trump who can't.

0,"Chew on this Pa-tricked>>>>  President-elect Donald Trump's proposals would modestly cut income taxes for most middle-class Americans. But for nearly 8 million families -- including a majority of single-parent households -- the opposite would occur: They'd pay more.  Most married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found. And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, they'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America's richest 1 percent.  The tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status. These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income.

They saw the president wavering and wanted to remind him to play to his racist base.  Kelly stopped them.  Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security, had a solution in mind aimed at allowing Trump to pretend to fulfill a campaign promise while easing the president’s clear misgivings about ending a program geared toward children — many of whom had no idea they were being brought to the country illegally.  Delay the program’s end by six months, Kelly told Trump.  There was a practical benefit of this approach too; it would give Congress time to devise a legislative fix to protect nearly 800,000 Dreamers.

We have developed into a Du-archy.  We haven't had a decent President since Eisenhower. Every one since then has been bought and paid for by the Soros' and Koch's and their like.  Contrary to what the parties would like everyone to believe, the nomination of Trump and the fact that the democratic nomination was stolen from Sanders by the party elite, the last election is proof of the rejection of the two party system.  Both parties are imploding and if the two party system is not dissolved, I expect there will be as many as five viable parties in the near future

It's also funny that you like to try to keep assessing me by calling me names.  You don't know me.  Just because I don't believe that animals deserves rights,  doesn't make me the bad person you want to try to make me out to be. It's 1 thing if Lara Trump wants to help the feral horses, it's quite another that she's aligning herself with a radical groups.

This is in additition to decades of Trump crime family NY and NJ crimes, their mafia casinos used by Russians et al for massive money laundering, and their more recent money laundering international escapades like Trump Toronto or Azerbaijan (where the Trump org worked directly with the Iran Rev National Guard -- denoted a terrorist organization today!)  Neither Trump nor Clinton committed any crime engaging in oppo research.  The crime was a campaign accepting things of value from a foreign government to alter the outcome of the election.  As the Russian spy told Don Jr before the treason meeting: """"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump""""  Government support = Election crime.

Thus, county, city, state, federal efforts to correct issues often fail because of the generational family dynamics  (Trump has no answers beyond appealing to nostalgia) - industrial workers in the Rust Belt - coal industry; steel industry; etc. will not be coming back.  If steel, chemical, etc. do come back - technology has advanced such that employed workers will not increase.  The issue is technology; climate change; need to increase green energy.  Thus, family/education support will be the key (not destroying int'l trade agreements) - my family are rural, white - reality is that their farms exist because of federal *welfare* (which they would deny).  That welfare has been around for decades and is known as crop subsidies; crop insurance (they are actually paid to not plant at times); etc. And that crop subsidy is part of Food Stamps (both win)

Let us face it, Africa's population growth is staggering - fertility rates remain exceptionally high. A country like Ethiopia had a famine in 1973, when its population was 30 million, today it has a population over 90 million and unsurprisingly, it still can't feed itself and remains one of the biggest recipients of emergency food assistance worldwide.  Trump's reintroduction of the golden gag rule  as well as his assault on global climate change are probably the two biggest assaults on the most vulnerable in Africa today.  Rather than focus on 'leading this current humanitarian effort', and lying to the Canadian public that they are actually resolving anything substantive - Canada is better served trying to ensure that common-sense reigns supreme when it comes to tackling underlying development challenges.

Trump tweeted repeatedly that then president Obama should stay out of Syria.

And the Republican controlled congress did nothing. Trump, who famously said, """"I alone can fix this"""" and """"Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated"""" now has a change of heart about Assad (but he's willing to still blame Obama). What led Trump to trust Assad? Trump says he will not disclose and retaliatory actions. I doubt he will engage in any military action. With the Russians controlling things as they have with Syria for a long time, there is little that can actually be done without sacrificing our own troops.

Trump will nominate many good people for his administration, and is not afraid to choose people with strong personalities.  NOTE:  The comment above was REJECTED 6 hours ago. Apparently it is not civil to criticize Mr. Obama, Mr. Holder and Ms. Lynch while saying anything positive about Mr. Trump or Mr. Christie.

0,"I agree in principal. And I agree that the leaks relating to the article at hand aren't helpful. But that's on the leaker, not the media.  Now, Russia attempting to influence the presidency and potential coverups do equate to criminal action, and I don't think they hurt us all if they help lead to a clear understanding of exactly where people's priorities lie. It's not fabricated, there was indeed an attempt to influence the election. None of the leaks assume Trump colluded with the Russians but there is a lot of suspicious behavior and the placing it in the public narrative is a necessary struggle. I don't have a conclusion based on the leaks - but I think a lot of them deserve answers. Trump saying Comey was a """"nut job"""" isn't worthy of a leak. But knowingly hiring Flynn when he was under active investigation, Trump's attempt to block the investigation, and then Trump's public vs. private reasons for firing Comey are all important things and not just partisan bickering.

1,"Trump is a self confessed cowardly criminal draft dodger.  All of us Trump's age (born in 1946) had to deal with the call by our country to serve.  There was no active resistance to the draft in 1964-5 when most of us were called in for our physical, no well publicized expose of the war. In fact U.S. soldiers were just advisors in Vietnam. So Trump the pampered son of privilege was too scared and cowardly to join the service. Many were sent to Europe, Japan or Korea.  Many more served their two year hitch in the states. His odds for a duty that might require courage were very low. Still he had to commit fraud to better the odds.  How will this cowardly bully manage the military?  He won't.  No self respecting soldier would follow a cowards orders.  His behavior with regard to the draft is grounds for immediate impeachment if we have the votes.  In two years we must have the votes in congress to bring a bill of impeachment.  In the meantime Boycott Trump wherever you see the name.

It would seem to me that those numbers indicate a lot of decent people marched yesterday.  As opposed to Friday's inauguration, there were no arrests in DC related to the March.  The closest thing I saw in Helena was two pick ups driven by young male Trump supporters who revved up their engines and blew their horns and then left when they realized just how big the march was.

0,"Trump's H-1B order directs the government to study how the H-1B law should be amended.  He cannot change it by order.  He is all hat, not cattle.  This was a publicity stunt, although apparently he and his staff do not understand that.  He essentially signed a memo with people watching.  It is no shock that as a capitalist and as president he is quietly doing the opposite of what he proclaims.  Interestingly, the Goldman appointees are probably his most qualified - certainly more so than the conservative ideologues whose disdain for workers is palpable. These stunts are a smoke screen so voters don't notice that Trump does not care for them or does not think they are smart enough to notice (especially on tax policy, which some say is on hold for now anyway).  Have we already had an infrastructure publicity stunt? Did it say anything about gas taxes (which have room to grow with lower prices). On school choice, the Trinity Lutheran case will give him an undeserved win, not DeVos.

It's assumption based upon pure speculation.  I find Comey's excuse that concerns about Lynch as a result of the meeting required such urgency that it was necessary to bypass the chain of command & established procedure & take things into his own hands highly questionable.

Trump's campaign of emphasizing aggressive nationalism and racism by closing borders, deporting people, and withdrawing into an isolationsist stance in regards to trade and treaty agreements is the very definition of a fascist movement. His remarks about solving street crime problems on the day he's elected sounds a lot like a declaration of martial law in the making. Article 1, Section 9 confers the title of Commander in Chief upon the President, giving him the power to do so, although it would likely trigger a Constitutional crisis.  Trump is a demagogue of the worst kind: narcissistic, impulsive,egocentric, and sociopathic. That the GOP continues to shuffle its feet and mumble in the face of a clear and present danger speaks volumes about the ideologues who now populate the party.

To see those who epitomise a party of death championing tax cuts for the rich while shortening the lives of the poor calls to mind John Paul II's condemnation of a 'culture of death.'  Now these champions of death are presuming to lecture everyone else on the true meaning of Christmas!!!  It's obscene to see those prepared to kill the poor - to slaughter the innocents in our day -  extolling the virtues of Christmas.

The Trumps all chose not to contribute in the most personal way one can to defend America’s freedom of speech, and to preserve the bounties of our economic and political system.

0,"I didn't like Harper - too secretive, but what I did admire his efforts to restrain spending. I know a lot of people suffered because of that. I am sorry. What we decided on instead was to elect Trudeau on some sort of vague, """"rainbows and unicorns"""" platform. Canadian politics at its best - the name, the look (cute), a promise to spend, to legalize marijuana, to reform the electoral system. Has Trudeau done any of that? No, but Mike Duffy's back in the senate. Fact is, we are running up substantial national debt under Trudeau including health care. We pay its professionals a lot, spend too much on drugs and equipment and apparently the system is still inefficient. So if there was an area to cut spending to force efficiency, provincial health care transfers should be top priority. Doctors that leave will perhaps have better luck in Trump's America. We can recruit other professionals to replace them. To our great fortune there are always people willing to move to Canada.

0,"Here's how you stop a Trump: per capita economic growth and greater relative economic equality. Western leaders at the end of World War II understood this, perhaps because the experience of fascism and communism was still close and they understood what made for their appeal.

Our elites, both left and right have lost sight of this recently.

0,"This story shows why Trump’s CEO mindset is unpresidential. He let Bannon control his hiring and Bannon seems to have hired his stable of Deplorables. It is time for Republican leaders to force Trump to clean house and put in qualified professionals. Next time someone says we need a businessman as President, laugh at him.  Theoretically, block grants can provide adequate funding if Congress does its job. That is not very likely, however. This proposal runs on the simplistic desire to limit intergovernmental funding and let states decide how to meet their needs. The problem is that some people are more highly favored than others based on immigratio status, skin color, etc.

They intended to put something out there that was so outrageous – yet so appealing to a large number of not-so-thougthful Americans – that the courts would essentially act against the wishes of Trump's supporters.

So, lets look at some points in history in which the peninsula was partially controlled by the Chinese state: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/66i6jw/was_korea_ever_a_part_of_china_as_us_president/  The rest of your post, I find quite biased but that's o.k., you have never claimed to be anything other than a deep blue democrat and proud of it!

They demand federal money then bash the government that gives it to them. They constantly campaign on getting rid of any federal """"say""""  in Alaska. Well, this time they'll be more likely get their wish. The feds don't seem all that interested in keeping Alaska happy. Sad. Just as ridiculous are people who are on Medicare and Social Security who complain about the federal government running """"entitlement programs"""" then screaming at that same government """"stay away from my Medicare and social security benefits!""""

There's a very real possibility of a conflict of interest and a biased ruling, in that case.  But exactly how many cases is he going to rule on this year that have any spectre of involving Trump, the Republicans, or the US Federal Government or Trump voters, given that he's an Ontario Provincial Justice? Conflicts of interest typically require a possible biased ruling.  If that biased ruling isn't even truly a possibility due to context, there's no possible compromise to the justice's impartiality.  It's unprofessional, of course, but this wasn't going to have any real world impact on his cases. Nor could it.  Give him a slap on the wrist and let him get back to work.

You really want Pence or any of the other wack jobs Trump has put there? Why do you think the Republicans are supporting him?  It isn't because Trump is Republican, its because Trump is the wet dream for every sick individual in the world and only he will be blamed by the majority. Not one of the sick individuals that support him will be held accountable, it is always Trump.  The US is a very sick society is dire need of help and what that help could be, I have no idea except to remove everyone who thinks like Trump and there are lots around.

How do you know that President Trump gave little of his money away? From what I have read he is a very generous person.

The GOP lost many Eisenhower republicans: rational & forward-thinking pragmatists who'd agreed with OUR federal government's actions to fund the great G.I.Bill, to enforce school desegregation, to fund NASA, and to build the massive interstate highway system.

In your question: """"who hasn't made a typo when texting?"""", my answer to that is: No one who tells everyone that he's the smart one and was just elected to lead his country. Besides, you need to find the definition of a """"typo.""""  Other than that, Trump is a mysogynist, he's a bully, he's a racist, he's immature, he's self-centered, he's a low-class, uneducated, narrow-minded, fraudster, he's a thin-skinned megalomaniac, a liar, a demagogue, an opportunist, a manipulator... I could go on, but let's just say that this is NOT ALL I've got.  As for China, let me be succinct about this: I'm not a big fan of China's domestic and foreign policy, to put it mildly.

The serious issues I have with Clinton aren't directly a left/right kind of thing. They have more to do with systemic corruption and corporate influence.  As you point out, Clinton is better than Trump on a number of issues. But that doesn't mean that Clinton is acceptable. For the issues that I am most concerned about, Clinton is either just as bad as, or in some cases worse than, Trump.  That's why I cannot vote for either of them. They are both completely unacceptable candidates. You say """"the enemy of the god is the perfect"""", but that phrase assumes that Clinton is """"good"""". I simply don't think she is.

0,"What Trump got right (I'm paraphrasing): our military should be a lethal fighting force with only one mission - overwhelming victory. What Trump got wrong: categorically denying loyal and potentially lethal citizens the opportunity to serve as members of our military, based on this disingenuous red herring of medical costs. This action, based on lies, puts our loved ones in the military at risk, puts people we're protecting in distant lands at risk, and puts our very freedom and safety as a nation at risk. If we expect to create that warrior culture and protect those who are in harm's way, we recruit the best and brightest. And we do it without regard to race, sexual orientation, or gender identity. When a transgender soldier saves a comrade's life, or prevents a terror attack, or pilots a damaged jet safely home, what price do you put on that?

1,"Her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Hillary Clinton, by reason of her advocacy for children, families, and health care, has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Donald Trump ever has or ever will.  Through most of his life, he has been militantly pro-choice, and while I know people can and do change their minds, when Chris Matthews asked Trump about his evolution on abortion, it was immediately evident that Trump had not given the issue so much as five minutes of thought.  Over the next six hours, he adopted four different positions on abortion. Moreover, no-one who mocks the handicapped can ever be seen as pro-life.  Trump is a racist, fascist know-nothing blowhard.  To describe him as pro-life, to support him or vote for him on the basis of pro-life concerns,is to diminish the pro-life movement and demean those who are genuinely committed to it.

And if you look at those numbers, that is why President Obama never sent the 'agreement' to the Senate where it would take 67 votes to approve it.  He knew that it wouldn't pass.  And that was back in 2015 before Trump even ran for office.  How many voters voted against Hillary because she was in favor of it?

0,"Good grief. The question is why Canadian support for free trade with China appears to have increased  13% in the last 18 months, not why Trudeau supports free trade with China. Further, it's  why this increase occurred in that period even though Canadians remain adamantly opposed (78%) to the sale of high tech firms to China that impact the security of Canada and its allies and that Trudeau seems to support.  If Trudeau's preferences concerning the latter aren't having much effect, why  should you think his preferences concerning the former are key? The difference in the larger world  is the American election and Trump's  presidency in which objections to NAFTA were and are a constant theme.  It's not Canada (or Trudeau) that's making noises about abandoning Canada's economic relationship with the US, but the other way around. The economically rational response on the part of Canadians (and Mexicans ) therefore is to look, at least tentatively,  to alternative trade relationships.

0,"<<Mr. Bannon has long argued that Americans, whether they know it or not, are in a war with radical Islam, describing it in sweeping, almost apocalyptic terms. His view appears to be shared by Mr. Trump and his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, and by several lower-ranking officials. Illuminating Mr. Bannon’s views is a lengthy talk he gave in the summer of 2014 via Skype from Los Angeles to a Vatican meeting of the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative Catholic group based in Rome. What follows are brief audio and video excerpts of the talk, which was first published in full by BuzzFeed in November, with explanatory comments.>>  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/01/us/stephen-bannon-war-with-radical-islam.html

1,"1/2 Of course Trump is a fascist. He checks all the fascist boxes, except one. The classic fascist leader emerges from poverty and obscurity. Trump was a spoiled, rich brat who, had he not been born to money and privilege, would have lived his life in obscurity. He fits the profile of a fascist in every other respect. He asserts that the Fatherland has lost its former glory and is under attack from within and from without. He scapegoats racial, ethnic and religious minorities. He proposes to keep people out and throw people out based precisely on ethnic and religious considerations. He taps into fear and stokes hate. He encourages his followers to violence against those who oppose him, even offering at one point to pay their legal bills. He even suggested violence against the other candidate and suggested that he would jail her.

And we should all thank Mr Obama for his most generous gift to America, President Donald J. Trump.  We should also thank Vladimir Putin and the Russians for their kindness of exposing the cancerous graft and corruption in the Democratic Party and in the crooked Hillary Clinton campaign.

0,"The idea that the CIA can't be trusted because it dropped the ball on Iraq WMD intell is ludicrous. The CIA under George Tenet never concluded that Iraq had WMD, that notion came from the Cheney created Office of Special Plans at Rumsfeld's Pentagon. That org was created to intentionally take raw unvetted intell that suggested the presence of WMD directly up the ladder to Bush's desk. It was Condi """"mushroom clouds"""" Rice job to vet all the intell before it reached the POTUS desk but of course she was in on the neocons schemes to overthrow Sadaam and capture the oil fields for international oil cartels. So she sent the bogus intell on to Bush who had discussed the overthrow of Sadaam at the very first cabinet meeting in January of 2001. Desperately grasping at straws to make the CIA untrustworthy only reminds America that it wasn't the spy agency that failed but an administration dead set on invading a sovereign nation via corrupted intell that failed. Trump favors fake new sites to CIA.

Social conditions and access have improved during that time for women, blacks, gays, transgenders,  physically hadicapped, etc which provides a sense of a more open society.  But the Trump phenomenon seems to have opened a floodgate of hate and revenge. Also he touched on the message of prosperity now promoted by evangelicals that has replaced the 10 commandments and other teachings that presented ethical behavior as a spiritual value.  That view is as celebrated as it is base.

He would sell Obamacare if that was all he had. 2- Asked about the huge tax cut for the wealthy in the AHCA, one answered """"what can we say, we are Republicans""""-- the wealthy have huge influence because a few of them like the Kochs and others that have sprung up with PAC's are very active politically and give them way more clout than years ago (and Ivanka and Jared would each like a $200,000 tax cut each year for spending money instead of asking Daddy for money). 3- Republicans have adopted the Obamacare philosophy-- """"we help you"""" and not """"you help yourself"""" anymore-- more will come in the future.

Yes, I heard Trump speak of the sanctity of pregnancy,  I also saw his disregard for religion in his life or its values in his businesses, Trump University fraud suit being the then current and exposed.  There was scant Catholic objection.  Fifty years ago, in the US priests would have been very assertively at the forefront of Christian values.

The US takes our exports for made up in USA prices and than value adds the stuff bought at the Canadian Discount store and makes buckets of money. Trump likes being rich,  fame and glory almost as much as he likes his friends to be rich, so Canada keep up sending our stuff to US and all will be well, there is no concern, Trump will not upset this apple cart. It is really to bad that we have no political leadership that will put Canada first, just elected people looking after themselves.

0,"Very good article. Thank you.  Magnanimous how Trump gave the Pope writings from MLK  But the pope gave Trump his own writings!

I predicted here last week that Trump would run circles around the pope.  The president knows how to be magnanimous; the pope tends to smallness when he's faced with a competitor.  And the first lady, well, what class and good visits.

0,"Trump has launched a comprehensive, multi-pronged attack on human life and human dignity. He is presiding over the most pervasively anti-life, pro-death administration in history: he's eviscerated the EPA; withdrawn from the Paris climate accords (and isolated the US in the process); proposed immigration policies and orders rooted in religious and ethnic bigotry, designed to divide families; violated every promise he made about healthcare in order to support healthcare bills that would strip insurance (and therefore care) from millions of people (many of whom voted for him); proposed a mean-spirited, deadly budget that harms the sick, the poor and the aged. Does anyone believe that the nomination of a SCOTUS justice who may (or may not) vote to overturn Roe offsets the increase in abortions, infant mortality and maternal deaths that will be spawned by Trump's pro-death agenda? Shame on anyone who believes that! They were duped and they let themselves be duped.

On the very fist day of the primaries, every single Super Delegate pledged their support for Clinton. They didn't wait until the end of the primary process like they were supposed to do. The result was that at every state's primary, Democratic voters were told that the nomination was already locked up in favor of Clinton, leading many people into casting their votes for her instead of Sanders. Why would they """"throw their vote away"""" on someone they had been told was already a second place? Who ran the DNC? Why, it was the same person who ran Clinton's first attempt: Debbie Wasserman-Shultz. The proof that she couldn't be trusted to treat all candidates fairly is our current leader, President Trump.

Feel free to believe everything he says even in the face of clear facts to the contrary but at least have the good grace and sense to acknowledge a possible cause for concern.  The man is now actually considering pardoning himself and all his administration.

It puts the responsibility on states and private development to build infrastructure projects like the Rail. The Federal government will help with obtaining financing and States and municipality's will use their borrowing power to provide, obtain, or support private financing and management of the project. The Chinese have said they are interested in US infrastructure projects (and they are in the process of cutting deals now)-- with Chinese ownership of land at Kapolei and Ko'olina-- they might be interested. We sell or finance the project at a discount and get it done. Bank of Hawaii and First Hawaiian have expressed interest in financing the rail on this basis, so get them involved.

The MSM reports negative stories over 90 of the time concerning Trump, while conveniently not reporting on the employment rate, growth of the economy, confidence of consumers, on and on. Do you believe the non-reporting of positive news is by accident? I stated that the establishment, which includes the MSM, abhor Trump as President. Trump puts the U.S. first. Is that bad? If the U.S. is not strong, we cannot help the rest of the world. Do you agree with that? Trump wants to change the tax code. Past President's for decades haven't tackled the issue. It's about time someone ran the government like a business. Does it bother you that billions of dollars have never been accounted for from Hillary's State Dept.?  How can you simply not care? I find it to be rather ironic that Hawaii overwhelmingly voted against Trump, yet Trump's qualities are exactly what the State needs. Do you disagree?

0,"A well drafted analysis of the grim consequences of Mr. Trump's ill-advised action by Rubin, who's one I count on for reasoned thought. The pardon was both premature and predictable, given the Administration's penchant for rewarding its 'true believers' as well as its knee jerk zeal for erasing any trace of policy enacted during the Obama era regardless of its merits.  Another Obama measure fell at the hands of Jeff Sessions, who reversed the ban of certain surplus military equipment to local police agencies. The firepower and force of such weaponry - rocket-launchers, bayonets and the like - are overkill in civil circumstances and best left in the hands of the military.

Respecting the flag and the anthem is to be taken as a given, because without the nation, you would not even have the options. These athletes are so arrogant in their belief that they are right, that they would take away one of the few remaining unifying events out there: sports. This means they do not respect your right to disagree.  You must agree with their politics to watch them play. Big mistake. Personally, I'm done with the NFL, NBA and any other organization that wishes to follow suit.  And MSM: just shut up. Your agenda and your virtue signalling is pathetic.   On the plus side, watching all the athletes and MSM take Trump's bait is astounding.  They still can't even fathom how easily he plays them with little more than a few words. Truly a masterful effort, the man is absolutely brilliant.

He doesn't appear to believe in or care much about anything, except about Donald J. Trump. But about Donald J. Trump, and his corporate empire he's passionate. He's in the process of merging the presidency, the corporation and his family to form the most corrupt government in American history. Trump will always be focused on the aggrandizement of Donald Trump, the Trump corporate empire and the Trump family.  He now has the presidency of the United States at his disposal.

We want to keep the government from being overrun tomorrow and the Taliban from taking more territory and get the parties to a negotiated settlement that Trump's people have coneeded will probably include the Taliban.

Today, at his impromptu """"news conference"""", Trump fully embraced the alt-right, the white supremacists, the neo-Nazis, the fascists, the Klansmen who make up his base.  This filthy, despicable man said that the Nazis were being treated unfairly by the press! No one can support Trump, no one can work for him, without being stained by the filth of the man. It's time to impeach.

They are less political parties in the service of their followers as they are corporations in the service of their owners. Trump managed to break through the control of management at party R while party D pulled out the stops to insure that their anointed choice got the nomination. The way I see it this probably cost party D the game.  This election was not about left vs right. It was about top vs bottom. The bottom gave the top a big middle finger. If party R sees this as as anything other than a repudiation of politics for the benefit of the owner class we are in for a very rough ride.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly, and it seems, with increasing frequency, shown that basic human decency is sadly lacking in his makeup.

His disdain for women, minorities and the poor is openly displayed.  IMO, with each day he proves more convincingly that he's, by far, the worst Presidential candidate in our history.

The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows presidents to protect areas of significant natural and cultural heritage as national monuments.  Trump is acting to dismantle the Antiquities Act.  The Act has been used by nearly every president since its passage and nearly half of the country’s national parks were originally protected as national monuments.

That money went somewhere -- likely into Swiss bank accounts of top generals. Find and retrieve that money and then I'll listen to complaints about poor people abusing the system. Those same generals get 53 cents of every tax dollar you pay, yet couldn't even protect us from 19 guys with box cutters. Now that's a far greater waste of money, and it doesn't even help Americans alleviate poverty. Meanwhile Trump (your guy, I suspect) is cutting money for drug dependency programs. You're a cruel and selfish person, Pcalde, and not even the fiscal conservative you apparently aspire to be. Cut the subsidies to the rich, like the oil & gas magnates, and then maybe I'll believe you're sincere. The present system is personified by welfare for the rich. and warfare for the poor.

The operative came under scrutiny from officials at the FBI and the State Dept partly because of at least two trips he took to the U.S. during the presidential campaign.  The joint Russian-Ukrainian citizen who trained in the Russian army as a linguist, told investigators in Kiev and Washington that he met with Manafort during an April trip to the United States. And, after a late summer trip to the U.S., the agent suggested that he had played a role in gutting a proposed amendment to the Republican Party platform that would have staked out a more adversarial stance towards Russia, according to a Kiev operative.

Instead of addressing a single one of Murrow's substantive allegations, McCarthy attacked Murrow.  In some ways McCarthy was both made and destroyed by the new emerging medium of television.  I see prosecutorial abuse as more similar to McCarthy than I do regular politics.  It is in criminal investigations and prosecutions that reputations are truly ruined.

Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA.  There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.  Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels.  Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks.  This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.

And the President of the US, the most powerful man in the world, reacted to the resignation by tweeting:  “Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”  What has to happen to get such a childish """"leader"""" to resign?  (And btw - it's generally good for us not 1% if a company lowers drug prices.)
"
0,"In Trump's press conference , he said  """" Big Pharma is getting away with murder """" and promised to step up competitive bidding on these obscenely priced drugs.   On the other hand every congressman is a millionaire due to their insider drug stock purchases . I'm really rooting for The Donald on this one.  Lower drug costs will help Canada too.

0,"I would contend they are neither """"liberal dogs"""" or """"striped hyenas"""" both are far too gracious a label of character. These insane attacks though not just limited to President Trump are the product mindless hate on steroids 24/7 by un-American, anti-America de facto Democrats/party which is a national disgrace. They are currently not only engaged in their insane monument madness. Now these creeps have moved beyond just monuments to vandalizing looters desecrating war veterans graveyards, grace markers and historic battlefields. They are attempting to dig up dead confederate soldiers to do what? Abuse a corpus? How sick is that?

0,"You can't remove Trump just because he tweets. I'm also pretty sure that everyone who was doing anything at Mar A Lago was vetted by Secret Service, down to flower deliverers who left many hours prior.  The ties to Russia have already been investigated. No influence in the election. But, Trump's Sec. of State, as Exxon/Mobil Exec, is going to have dealings with many countries and their leaders, in order to get the best deals for the shareholders. He also knows how to deal with the Russians, not necessarily a bad thing.  As regards the leaks, we do not have a one party gov't. members of both parties sit on committees with oversight. Some committee members take their responsibilities extremely seriously. Feinstein on Defense or Foreign Relation could have been approached to be informed as to what is happening.  Leaks to the press about unauthorized wiretaps and their contents need to be punished.

Never mind the ever increasing flow of proof of Hillary's royal ways.  Just focus on what Hillary wants you to focus on.  Focus on Trump is """"unfit"""" to be President.

0,"The only thing that has a chance of stopping abortion is formation. Abortion rises sharply during economic down turns which unfortunately affect minorities at a greater rate than whites. The same argument about abortion & birth control just isn't good enough. Even if it became illegal tomorrow it would still continue. Women & babies would both die in back alley abortion clinics or women would become criminals, locked up with their children in foster care because the father has left the family...there are endless scenarios I can argue. You, of course, make several points but your largest reason for voting Trump is abortion & birth control. All I am hearing is birth them and grow them so they can be sent off to war if they are boys or kept barefoot & pregnant if they are girls and the girls should expect a grope now & then after all, it's what men do.

0,"""""Sometimes it’s like Donald Trump doesn’t even get how free trade works""""  Actually, he does.  You have US companies, using the US financial, legal, and patent system, exporting manufacturing jobs for their products for reimportation back into the United States for sale to American citizens.  In effect, Americans can buy the product, but they can't make it.  They can borrow using the financial system (*cough* 2008 *cough*) in the United States and when the banks screw up they get bailed out with taxpayer money to buy these products, but they can't actually make the products.  They can take advantage of the US educational system and hire great engineers and thinking minds (*cough* Apple *cough) yet make practically none of their products in the United States.  I think Trump gets it really well.  We're not talking about Huwai selling Chinese designed phones in the United States, or BMW selling German made cars into the United States.  When your biggest export is jobs, you are in trouble.

Words like women are b i iches, kill cops, f this and f that and f f f f f.

The double standard by both establishment parties is insane and combined with the double standard of the media is unbelievable.  The fake outrage over comments that are being applied to the Trumpster and that have never been applied to those on the left by either party is outrageous.  The stranglehold on D.C. by professional politicians has been the main contributing factor the downward spiral of this country.  The most vocal right and left wingers on both sides dominate the discussion and direction of politics while the majority of the middle of the road Dem/Rep get played and we act like we are rooting for a sports team.

That dependency is what Trump will exploit, (among others) to put Canada into a position where it begs and kneels to please him, sacrificing any and all to not incur his wrath.  That Canada geographically can't sell the stuff competitively elsewhere, the US is our only market, is the rope that will hang us.  He'll cut us off until we're too poor to argue, then take what he wants almost for free.  Didn't you know?  When Trump was elected, Canada ceased to be a free country.  It's now a subsidiary that thinks it's in control. Education is the only way out of this.  The first country to produce more college grads than assembly line workers wins.  But you have to start those programs decades in advance, and they have to function.  They can't be political payoffs, or be otherwise emasculated with politics. We have no chance. How will this affect our other problem, with the Planet?  Not at all.  Neither are still winnable.

We cannot allow Trump to alienate the billions of Muslims in the world, Muslim countries and our own non-Muslim allies. We need and want Muslims, especially in this country, to help identify and report potential radical Islamic terrorists? Why would they now given the words and tenor of the Trump administration that can only be  perceived as anti-Islam? Trump's supporters may love what he's doing, but we're playing right into the Jihadist's hands. Oh, I almost forgot.

0,"People who have suffered loss from Irma and Harvey should file a class action suit against Trump and his minions, seeking compensation for damages and citing years of federal inaction on climate change as the reason for the suit and the cause of the injury.  The standard of proof in a civil action is """"the preponderance of the evidence"""" and never in scientific history has there been as much evidence of a geophysical phenomenon as there is of man-made climate change.  If Trump, Pruitt, Zinke, Governor Scott (who forbade the use of the term """"climate change"""" in state communiques) and company want to continue the practice of denial, they should face the legal consequences of it, in this case, the massive human suffering of millions of fully-empowered American citizens.

The field protests were never an insult to American veterans or the flag, but a call to our better selves as a complicated culture of many many different types of people.  Yes, vets deserve thanks for their service.  But Trump is using red meat to manipulate people into becoming rabidly angry so they don't notice his lack of leadership in getting healthcare fixed or anything else done in Washington.  Governing requires compromise and serious work, not insulting everyone and bouncing from one job to another while getting nothing done.  Some of Trump's supporters don't understand the complicated 21st century.  In fact we need every immigrant engineer we can get to stay ahead of the Russians and Chinese.   This is not a Casino game, surviving and flourishing requires adult judgement and hard work.

Congress _always_ had the power to levy an income tax but were blocked from IMPLEMENTING some forms of it until 16A was added to the Constitution.  You would have read that if you read the anti-tax sections on Eisner like I said.  """"Taxes on property and wealth could be levied freely by the states, and could be levied by the Federal Government if each state were required to pay A PROPORTION of the tax RELATIVE to its population."""" [if it created no new tax...where did this new tax come from] From the same source of Congressional power to tax property and wealth as noted above, the Constitution.  16A does not """"create"""" a """"new"""" power of taxation but removed a limitation found in Pollock, ie.

Apparently you missed a lot of the pro-Trump posters across the country who kept claiming the EC was unfair and would be why Clinton could win without the majority of the votes choosing her. As it turned out Clinton had the majority and Trump won due to the EC.  Every election there is a movement to end the EC. Few voters ever take the time to understand the reasons the EC was established. How many posters even know most State legislatures not citizen voters determined who would be president in the earliest election years. It was not until 1836 that most states allowed citizens to vote for president.  Basically the arguments to end the EC fall into two categories: My candidate won so the system is good; my candidate lost so the system is bad.

As a group, 'liberals' are more likely to see the need for taxes than those further right (although we do question some increases).  Witness the very rich who think they should pay none at all.  At least one, D. Trump, thinks his taxes are none of our business, and 'we the people' protest.

There were more than 1 million lost votes because people ran into things like ID laws, long lines at the polls, and difficulty registering.  Trump won the election by a total of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.   From the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 to the election of our first black president in 2008, the United States saw a gradual increase in voting access.  Twenty-two states have adopted new voting restrictions since then, more than half of which first went into effect in 2016  The 2016 election was the first presidential contest in more than 50 years without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act.  The 2016 election was undeniably helped along by Republican efforts to gut the Voting Rights Act and suppress the vote.  A crime we should never allow to happen again.

0,"It's not off topic at all. It's why we read the news - to try and figure out what is going on.  But the rally has been fed on hopes and Trump's promises of fiscal stimulus that are becoming increasingly vague. Yellen is hedging on the rate hikes she thought were a slam dunk a short while ago, and the rally is getting ahead of any real sign of increasing demand.  Many of us have been waiting till the last minute to buy RRSPs, to get an idea of what is going on. It doesn't make sense to buy equity-based mutuels when there is a bubble that seems to be popping, but it also doesn't make sense to buy fixed income when there is so much talk of rate hikes.  And now Trump throws more raw meat to his base, and now Spicer will disavow the statements and castigate MSM for taking Trump's emphatic pronouncements literally, and now we have even more uncertainty, and now I really have to make a decision about those RRSPs!

Also, you do realize that blue states claiming the deduction are net tax payor's as they receive less in federal funding than red states.  Trump and Ryan logic: upper middle class families are rich and need less money, but the.01% is really hurting and needs tax relief.  Seriously a family of 4 making 200k is in better shape than those pulling down $10m a year.  Don't be fooled, this tax plan is a further redistribution of wealth to the .01%

Putting aside some of Trump's comments on Twitter, the U.S. government and the U.S. as a country continue to function well, overall, despite the vehement opposition to Trump from many in the media, and the many other individuals more interested in taking apart every Trump statement, rather than doing more productive things with their lives, perhaps.

[W])? Obama's failures relatively were minor. He did--- and inspections and intel show it's true--- prevent Iran from nuclear weapon accrual. As far as N.

The author is correct that labor force participation is as important to understanding the Trump phenomenon as the headline unemployment number, but his shocker figure - 32% of American men over 20 have left the labor market - is deeply misleading because it includes retirees and college students. Anyone with access to Google can look up the salient number, which is LFP for men 25-54, on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website. For men 25-54, the LFP was 88.2% in 2014, which is  2 points down from 90.5% in 2004 and 3.5 points down from the 91.7 figure in 1994, during Clinton presidency. Those are real, if modest declines, and while I didn't check state-by-state figures, they're probably higher in the Rust Belt. But it's a long, long way from 68%, which is the number the author gives. This, Canadian readers, is why you should always, always be suspicious when you see figures from the American Enterprise Institute, which is a right wing propaganda machine.

Am glad for more women in politics but one of the reasons she didn't win (and why Voldemort did) is because many left-leaning persons sat on their hands for that vote.

And neither did Mr Trump who will actually have to deal with all of those since building walls will not be the answer to all of the above. The policies of Mr Obama actually, and for the first time ever, reduced the portion of health expenditures as a ratio of the US GDP. He also, as much as possible, avoided more US casualties in foreign war often falling on the poorest segments of the US.

0,"Well, I have read all of the posts and find that there are many differing opinions, of which many feel that the POTUS is not in his right mind and is lying, while others feel that POTUS will prevail after all the heads have rolled and the dust has settled.  My take on this is that there were 2 requests for FISA warrants to monitor TRUMP.  The first one was denied but the second request was approved.  Mind you that all of this was done during BHOs admin.  With political appointees in  the DOJ, NSA, FBI, etc., it wasn't difficult to get the second FISA warrant approved.  Someone on BHOs WH staff told someone that BHO wanted to tap TRUMPs election HQs in New York.  This was done prior to the election.  When BHO left office, he made the leak of information possible by allowing the 17 Intel agencies to share information, and all of these recent leaks have now taken place.  Thus, it is very possible that BHO will be implicated and the country will be in dire straights from then on.  AMEN!!!

You owe me an apology, but I don't expect one.  I agree that every president certainly has the authority (mandate) to make change.  However, there is a huge difference between Trump's extraordinarily weak mandate and the robust mandates of past presidents, such as Johnson's when he thumped Goldwater in '64 and Reagan's when he crushed Carter in '80.

0,"Arguably, Hillary Clinton is a terrible face for women in politics.  If we're being honest, we would admit that her rise was due to her being the wife of Bill Clinton, her Senatorial campaign springboarded by the popularity of her husband at the time.  Left on her own she lost against Obama, was a rather ineffective Secretary of State, and then lost against Trump.  One might argue that she did what women of her generation had to do to get ahead: rely on their husbands in a world of misogyny.  But one need only look at all the self-made, successful women in the Senate and Supreme Court to see that even that is not true.

What's amazing, is that according to the Fake News, no other politician in the history of the US or Canada has ever lied. Trudeau hasn't kept a single one of his campaign promises, yet according to the Fake News, Trudeau has never lied and everyone needs to trust him. And that's why they call it the Fake News.

0,"I watched the analysis on both MSNBC and FOX after the press conference. Both said that the questions were softball and Trump should have been asked about his security adviser and North Korea. FOX said the U.S. trade with Mexico is far greater than with Canada. Both made the obligatory 'Canadians are polite'. Neither knew that the Syrian refugees you took in were families,  homosexuals and orphans and left the viewer to just assume the pictures of the desperate people going to Europe is what Canada dealt with.  MSNBC spent more time talking about Trump and his problems than Trudeau. MSNBC had a former Canadian ambassador who did most of the talking with the usual sound bites. One of them mentioned (as a dig at Trump) that Trudeau said he would take those affected by the travel ban not knowing that the reality is different as in Emerson. The consensus on both was that it was just a 'safe' appearance and meeting for both. Trudeau served the purpose of a Canadian logo that talks.

"
0,"I didn't expect that you would find the comments to fall into the same category because you hate Trump and probably have minimal feelings toward Gorsuch.  In my book, if Gorsuch were acting as a professional, his response would not have been emotional, i.e. """"demoralizing,""""  but rather a responsible opinion relative to the role of politics in the judicial system.  That judges have political prejudice is clear from the massive political fights over the supreme court appointments.  If the courts were capable of non-political decisions, it would not matter whether qualified liberals or conservatives were appointed to the court because their job is to interpret the law based on the intent of the legislators who enacted it.  Judges capable of non-political analysis would tend to reach common conclusions.  The fact that judges diverge based on their political bent confirms Trump's comment.  So Trump points out a truth, but you don't like it because truth regarding courts should not be spoken?

0,"It is rather generous to suggest that Donald Trump is motivated primarily by """"economic nationalism."""" That term has at least some sense of nobility in that an entire nation's economy is considered as a whole in relation to other nations' economies. Unfortunately with The Donald that is not where it ends because in the end he is a Republican, and modern Republicans only care about the rich at the expense of the poor, as their recent proposed overhaul of the nation's health care laws amply demonstrate. So Republicans are not really concerned about the nation's economy as a whole but only that portion of the economy that benefits the rich.  Recently I read an article suggesting that Pope Francis is the """"anti-Trump."""" When it comes to the pope's concern for the poor, that is certainly true. Given that the world's rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, it's a good thing that at least one world leader is willing to be a champion of the poor. Thank God for Pope Francis!

They did  not need any media manipulation to see that the man is a vulgar, racist, bigot and sexual predator. I notice there is a concerted effort to already erase Trumps words and deeds from the campaign history but I will never forget and as professional women they will never forget or forgive people like you who attempt to apologize and normalize behavior that we teach our kids it totally unacceptable. Trump  didn't release his taxes because he was hiding information from the American people.

Apple contracts out the manufacturing but keeps the programming jobs in the United States, plus spends over 12 Billion USD on R&D, pays dividends to its shareholders which generates income tax to the U.S., and is building a massive circular head office in California. This business model is not a manufacturing business, but it does generate high end jobs in the United States, plus retail jobs as well, but the U.S. benefits mightily from the overseas sales which support the infrastructure in the United States, and the high U.S. corporate income tax. It depends too on companies such as Qualcomm and Samsung for parts, etc. but it also earns patents on its own. So how can Mr. Trump bring the jobs back to the U.S. when most of them are already there?

Political correctness has never killed anyone although it has gotten on my nerves very severely on occasion while a graduate student and teacher at UO.

Any one who opposes the white nationalists and their ilk at demonstrations like Charlottesville expect that they will wind up on the right side of history.  But that favorable judgement will not follow their high ideals if violence is met with violence. Gandhi, King and their followers who committed to the moral strength and true bravery of pacifism realized their goals by showing the world the truly despicable nature of those they opposed by their willingness to accept physical punishment in pursuit of the higher goal.  If the white nationalists gain too much traction within our country, with the wink and nod from Trump, then it will  most likely require the bravery of non-violent actions like the Civil Rights movement from the 50s and 60s or an all out war like the 40s.

It was Michael Moore who suggested Trump's supporters see him as a """"human Molotov cocktail' they'd like to throw at a political establishment they believe has been corrupted by Republicans and Democratic alike.  No wonder Russia, China and other totalitarian states are so keen on seeing Trump become president.

0,"Her eight years as Senator and four years as Secretary of State were part of her campaign for President, which began in 2000 when she left the White House. These were necessary resume building.  I may be exaggerating here, and I expect few to agree with me; but the talk of Hillary Clinton as Our First Woman President began almost immediately after Bush moved into the White House, and I cannot believe that this was not her aim all along.  I also believe that she would have made an infinitely better president than Trump - what a lame statement that is. But her campaign was gender-specific (""""I'm with Her""""), her policy proposals were nothing utterly conventional and unmemorable.  My point: there are more pressing issues than woman's reproductive rights. Those who put them front-and-center will not succeed.

0,"The growth of American fascism has been going on since Mussolini invented fascism in the 1920's. America in the 1940's was a fascist nation fighting  more virulently fascist Germany, Japan and Italy. FDR warned corporate takeover of government is the essence of fascism. He wanted to remove the military-industrial complex ruling America during the war but died in 1945. The military conveniently created the Cold War against communism to increase their power. Republican Eisenhower warned against it, to no avail. JFK didn't care about racism, civil rights or poverty but started the Vietnam War and war against Cuba. LBJ escalated the war. Nixon further escalated it. He was a racist to boot. Reagan was the same. Corporate-military takeover of government since WWII has persistently destroyed possibility of renewing FDR's New Deal for average Americans. Lawrence Martin conveniently omits Obama's suave transition from Bush to Trump. Nixon and Bush were more fascist than Trump is.

0,"The pollsters were pretty much dead on on popular vote, which is what they actually measured. How that translates to electoral college votes is somewhat of a probability problem, but when you look at the numbers, it is very compatible with the concept of Trump's win being a somewhat improbable event - none of the states he won past 273 were won by more than 1% of the vote.

Then you can meet with your Russian buddies and all have a big laugh!  Ha ha! I fired Comey! All my troubles are over.  I showed him!  The only thing Trump showed was his ass.

Funny how I've never once heard any of them called a flawed candidate.  In the video Moore says that Trump's belief system is Trump. If anyone ever wants to dissect how Trump came to beat Clinton perhaps it's better to start by figuring out how he managed to get past seventeen other well-known Republican establishment figures first. Answer the question about why some people voted for a man whose only belief system is himself instead of truly qualified people and we might be on to something.  But I'm glad Moore saw fit to remind people that Republicans have only won the popular vote in a presidential election once since 1988. That puts things into perspective.

He knows there are T-shirts outside the crowd and inside the venue with similar messages. He knows that Mr. O'Keefe's modus operandi involves selectively editing video in order to artificially increase the appearance of malfeasance, and that he's paid the price in court for excessive editorial license.

KelleyAnn thought she was 'good-hearted' in supporting her friends by endorsing Ivanka's brand, and her first reaction is not to apologize but defend herself.  Trump is so clueless he doesn't even know what he's doing and saying wrong, since he never considers any viewpoint except his own.  As the center of the universe, rules don't apply to him.  We may not know what is in Trump's heart, but we CAN judge him by his actions.

Bush, Ted Cruz--good god they have depth when it comes to stupid candidates--Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee--a basket chock full of idiots and deplorables but hey, we've come to expect no less from the Republican party.

In the victim’s mind, Obama, the inertia president, becomes god-like, a martyr (I guess because he is intelligent, articulate, a politician and black), DJT, the action president, is Satan (presumably because he is stupid, crass, inarticulate, not a politician and white).

More importantly, he paid little attention to these briefings and to his generals.  What is the point of attending intelligence briefings and then pulling out of Iraq prematurely leaving the country ripe for the picking by that Jay Vee team ISIS or of drawing red lines in the sand in Syria when everybody knows you are not going to enforce them or of leaving Libya to degenerate into anarchy and chaos or of helping to oust Mubarek and backing The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?

He has no sustainable appeal for the Canadian equivalent of the Reagan Democrats that Trump mobilized to great effect.

0,"The Canadian FPTP system has served the country well for almost 150 years. It is the system used by the strongest, most robust democracies in the world; namely the UK and the US.

Proportional representation systems are the hallmark of emerging democracies and welfare states.

As for the comments stating that Americans don't have or live up to the """"ugly American"""" meme, every place I have ever been that is frequented by American tourists is the same; hospitality staff roll their eyes if you mention Americans, and if you hear a loud, obnoxious group making a spectacle of themselves, they are almost certainly American.

Prof. Haycox rightly draws a parallel between the McCarthy era and the Trump agenda. If more Americans had a grasp of their own history, the similarities would be evident-attacks on the free press and anyone who disagrees with him. Trump blatantly lies about issues large (voter fraud) and small (inauguration day attendance) in spite of evidence to the contrary, i.e., facts. He goes on to demonize minorities, denigrate women and present a crude and vulgar role model for our children. I'm frightened about what the future under this demagogue portends, as every American who values our way of life should be. We all need to have hope that there are more Edward R.

So far this week alone 67 of these Trump supporters have been in my face - """"Go back to Mexico before Trump deports you!""""

1,"The bishops long ago hitched their wagon to the RNC to keep the attention of the one-percent and their largesse. If the past election taught us anything it is that many 'Christians' are hypocrites. One can add the USCCB to that cabal. Abortion rates drop under Democrats and rise under Republicans. Why? Because the latter create a toxic social environment. We are seeing more evidence of that with the increase in IUDs provided through Planned Parenthood since Trump's election . The bishops, like their evangelical brethren, ignore the evidence but 'facts' are hard to dispute. As long as we have bishops who 'smell like the 1%' rather than 'smell like the sheep' we will see decreasing influence of the bishops on mainstream Catholics social attitudes and teachings will be completely ignored. We all have 'Religious Freedom"""" and many of us may express it by ignoring the bishops.

0,"cont:  I will take the credit here & point out I was the first on this forum to attribute the terminology  'sociopathic liar' to Hillary, you & others then pivoted with Trump.  My conclusion is based largely in part to listening intently to a discussion by several licensed medical professionals my wife works with at RB [at a birthday party/social gathering.] Their consensus of debate was formed using the 10 leading key indicators as outlined within A P A 6th Ed. After they compared Hillary's history to Trumps,  she scored a clinical 10, Trump scored a clinical 6/7. Those knowledgeable enough to know conceptually agree that Hillary's dark triad history is amplified by her actions revealing  her personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. In other words calling Hillary out as being a proven 'sociopathic liar' is being most generous. Trump labeled as 'sociopathic' is based more upon subjective opinion rather then objective evaluation.

He is tolerated by the GOP since his 'believers', represented by an approval rating of less than 38%, are the majority of the Republican Party. Once that declines more fully, he will be dumped. The GOP will try to save themselves in 2018, not Trump. Additionally, saying 'Obama did it as well' every time Trump opines another inanity is becoming boorish and is the fall back response of school yard bullies not of people who yearn to be taken seriously.

But all of this only works when we deal with truth and reality. When we lie we threaten the foundation for effective action. When we act to disrupt co-operatively working together, we threaten the very foundation of our success as a species. Mr. Trump is the single greatest threat to humanity that possibly there has ever been, both in respect to the terrible way he disrupts cooperative and trusting relationships and his dishonesty and detachment from reality.

0,"eric, at the time of the Iraq war, I myself did not know what to think.  I am generally opposed to war except in cases of direct self defense, i.e. an attack on US territory.  But our leaders were telling us that Sadam was developing nuclear weapons and the rest of the lies.  At the time, I suspect that you would have been more reserved in your own reaction.  It was a confusing time.  Combine the uncertainty with the fact that Trump was not a decision maker and you have a situation where, in my opinion, he had not clearly formulated his opinion even to himself.  He may not have been vehemently opposed in an emotional sense.  That does not mean he supported the war in an active sense.  Recall that a good citizen, at the end of the day, supports their country and the decisions their representatives make.  The media and the Clinton campaign are the liars in my opinion.  Clinton actually voted for the war.  Her team is trying to defuse her responsibility by pulling Trump into the muck too.

He's not risking his life.  He's risking OTHER American lives (and definitely Guamanian, South Korean, and Japanese lives).  But he is physically removed from the risk of his big body, tough guy, ignorant bleeting.  He's playing chicken with Jong Un.

Someone should tally up, on an ongoing basis, the time Trump has spent on not  running the country against the time he spends on trying to polish his personal image. By the time the next presidential election rolls around, the Democrats will have gathered an enormous amount of ammunition to pull him down (if he isn't impeached before then). And for more fun, tally up all the blatant lies he has spouted. There are  books out on Bushisms.  Start one on Trumpisms. It will be real tome. Publish it after his first year in office.

Arizona having 2 senators over 80 years old is the most ridiculous proposal on earth.  Both fodder for the DNC body bag count. Then coward Gov.

Because it was Hillary and because it was a Republican Congress.  I have no trouble admitting that Hillary """"lost the votes that counted"""", meaning I suppose the Rust-Belt swing state votes that gave Trump the electoral college. Bernie Sanders now is saying he warned Hillary's team about this but was ignored. Ah! hindsight!  But when it comes to the awfulness of the two candidates, there is NO parity.

"
0,"This is where I don't trust Trump. Say he decides to impose a tariff on vehicles from Germany , logic holds that immediately the stock would drop and if were involved in Trump's inner circle you could short the affected stock and theoretically make a bundle. Or turn it around and say you knew that a German car company was going to invest billions in the U.S. because Trump bribed the company with a juicy incentive. Personally what Trump is doing is temporarily affecting capital markets in a democracy. In my opinion this is wrong on so many levels. Plus it's incredibly irresponsible. Disruption is one thing but spontaneity with the markets as a president is dangerous.

0,"Trump doesn't  pick on Hillary supporters like she and her 'supporters' constantly   berate  Trumps supporters  very,   very,   low. Very sad and childish.  Pick on the figureheads  not the people!  They are 'public' servants and have an expectation of criticism.

0,".  A great opportunity for America was missed when, in 1885, Donald Trump's grandfather, Freidrich Drumpf, arrived from Germany to make his living as a pimp and gambler.

0,"From the article:  """"...President Donald Trump on Wednesday blasted the NFL, accusing the league of “total disrespect for our great country” following a meeting of team owners that did not adopt a requirement for players to stand during the national anthem....""""  Did you catch that last sentence?  The NFL had a meeting and decided to NOT adopt a requirement for players to stand during the anthem.  They have the right to set their policy, they did so, and the President is not respecting it.  As far as Trump not doing anything unConstitutional?  """"...""""If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!"""" Trump tweeted...""""  He's said the players should be punished for exercising their first amendment right, instead of defending them to do so.  Arguably unconstitutional.  Where did I say anything about the 2nd amendment?

0,"No, it's the guy who was with the campaign for 5 months, 3 months as campaign chair, and was also Trump's convention manager.

0,"The best solution by President Trump would be to forego this anti-immigrant policy completely and seek a comprehensive law addressing the administration's concerns regarding any potential terrorists entering the US from any nation. Attempting to sidestep the legislative and judicial branches of the federal government is the wrong way to achieve its goal of a more secure America. An immense number of individuals have already been affected by the administration's past failed attempt at an immigration travel ban and an adverse Supreme Court ruling blocking this new one is virtually guaranteed. The Statue of Liberty holds a torch to light the way not to keep those seeking a better life at bay.

He can't focus, can't remember what he said a few minutes ago, becomes easily confused, uses the wrong words, mumbles, and is fixated on a few topics he has strong feelings about. Trump isn't an """"idiot"""" so much as he is losing his mind.

0,"This is the problem we all face when any institution declares itself infallible and that it (its leaders) cannot be challenged.  We see this today, not only in the RCC but also among the fundamentalist Muslims in Iran (once- and perhaps, covertly, still Western in beliefs) as well as the evangelical Christians who claim that Trump is divinely chosen.  Theocracies by definition declare that they have divine authority.  When ANY group states that 'god' has chosen their leader, who are we to challenge them?  And when we dare challenge their authority and choices, they cry out that we are challenging not just their chosen leader but also their god.  Children feared speaking to their parents because they would be 'guilty' of tarnishing the Church.  Parents sided with the Church- not their child!  Just one more reason why it is critical to NEVER allow our secular govt to be 'converted' into a theocracy.   Hopefully, the Pope clears house.  There is NO excuse for the attack on our youth.

1,"twit, troll, Trump twist
"
1,"Trump is a bully and diplomacy is clearly not his strength. He is used to get anything he wants by subduing his opponents, and he is discovering the hard way that his methods do not work when it comes to international politics. He does not understand that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of vinegar, so he goes out of control and tweets his anger whenever things don't go his way. His childish attitude is a clear advantage for his opponents, who will often use it to get under his skin. I expect the sales of his book """"The art of the deal"""" to plummet, for a negotiator who cannot control his emotions is doomed to fail.
"
0,"If he liquidated his business assets, that would be his income. Of course, his home in Mar a Lago is also a golf resort, and Trump Tower, where he lives in New York, is also a place of business.

"
0,"I would like to know which planet you are living on, in which it is constitutional for Obama to make the order, and unconstitutional for Trump to rescind it.  Congress makes laws. A president may clarify laws if necessary. Obama simply exempted nearly a million people from a law passed by congress under the guide of 'clarifying' the law. That is law-making by the president. It would be like exempting a million people from the law against robbery or drug trafficking because applying the law to them would be mean, in the president's personal opinion. A president CANNOT do such a thing.  I'd also like to know on which planet the pardon of Arpaio is unconstitutional, unless you count the editorial opinion pages of the NYT as """"the constitution"""" because that's the only place I've seen anyone argue it is unconstitutional, and they even admit their argument is based on a never-tested legal idea. Never-tested = total speculation upon which no court has ruled.

"
0,"His campaign rhetoric represents his personal statements that he was going to ban Muslims, not just people from certain countries.  Are you suggesting that personal statements made publicly aren't admissible in a court of law? To top that, he hired Rudy Giuliani to make his rhetoric appear constitutional. That is also admissible in court. Why would a reasonable person not think the rule's purpose was to ban a religious group which is not constitutional. The court so ruled.  Trump promised that he was able to make deals and would end the """"gridlock"""" in Washington. He failed. Conservatives don't make up a majority, neither do liberals. The majority is made up of """"the middle"""". They see Trump failed to do what he promised.  First you argue that Trump's words as campaign rhetoric shouldn't be taken seriously and then your claim """"Either their word(s) means something, OR it means nothing."""" Which is it? When do words go from mere rhetoric to being meaningful?

One might think that, when it comes to trade agreements - and 25 years of the effects those agreements have on legislation, regulation, economic harmonization and a ton of other things, that 'getting out', or unilaterally 'renegotiating' the deal, might not be as easy as signing a Presidential finding.  Anybody with a titter of wit in Ottawa, and/or Mexico City,  should be concentrating on that, rather than thinking of how to avoid the 'blowback' of being around when the other partner 'gets screwed'.

He showcased her dishonesty with the American people.  I watched Trumps comment live on asking the Russians to help find more information. He had just told a joke from the old Saturday night line about lying . He then continued the joke with calling on the Russians to find the emails Clinton had destroyed . It wasn't a serious call---it was a joke.  Those who saw it live know that ,   while the dishonest press and liberals try to say he was serious .  As for the 17 agencies---they are the same one's who said there were weapons of mass destruction and Hillary Clinton didn't break a single law over her emails and destroying evidence .  Trust them ?

Most people in the streets in Germany and the States just thrust their arms out without the heel click.  The Romans definitely did not do the heel click.  As for the rest of the banners and standards, yes, there is a historical resemblance.  So, in essence, when the American Trumpets salute I guess one can say they were just reverting to the old pledge. LOL.
"
0,"Trump's problem is called metacognitive deficit.  He doesn't know what he doesn't know, and doesn't realize that there are plenty of people who do know, and who therefore see right through him.  People with metacognitive deficit habitually overrate themselves on tests of intelligence, knowledge, ability, etc.  Hence Trump's ridiculous statements about his speech at the Capitol, the crowds at his inauguration, etc.  He literally does not know that his inflated self-rating fails to account for all the things he doesn't know and cannot do. Once in a great while he exhibits a sliver of insight, e.g. when he admitted that """"fixing"""" the ACA was harder than he thought it would be.  But then he forgets, or fails to learn from, this lesson.  Scary times; let's hope his senior advisers don't let him use the nukes.
"
0,"the same can be said about left wing people - happy to support muslims and then criticize the right for being against gay marriage. It literally goes hand in hand on both sides. That you somehow seem to think this is isolated to conservatives is naive. Bud maybe a little to nice on this topic (for the record, I agree wholeheartedly with Bud), however, both sides are hypocritical.  For that matter, what's with left wing people thinking that all canadian conservatives are super right wing pro tump supporters? Lol, Canada is way more left wing than the U.S., including Obama and other democratic politicians. Harper was and many conservatives (maybe not Kellie Leitch haha) still are. Just cause you vote conservative does not mean you hate gays and love trump. Everyone should think of every issue independently of party lines. If they did that we would all be better and likely realize we have way more in common than we think (and I will happily admit I can be guilty of that).

That being said while I agree the armed forces should not discriminate there are a lot of logistics and security issues that need to be addressed. While western civilizations are more tolerant I would hate to think how an American transgender POW would be treated by a less enlightened captor (e.g. taliban, ISIS, etc).  It took quite a while to accommodate women. Give it time.  It always begs the question though. If transgenders are not allowed in the military would that be an excuse from the draft should the Americans ever need to reinstitute it?

By the way, who do you believe supported Hillary? It was the elite liberals. Most of the wall street campaign funds went to Hillary; a very small percentage to Trump. You should do a little more research on Hillary. Trump and his family are sacrificing their time and money to help you.

Conservatives love to wave the flag and complain about the moral decay of America, especially in “Liberal” states and places like California and New York. The new moral decay in America is the ignorant sob pissed off at his life because even though he’s never seen a Muslim that’s never bothered him, rarely sees Blacks who could care less about him, and his job was outsourced to China or Mexico and will never come back unless he’s ok with $5.00 an hour.

0,"Having (regrettably) a couple of Trump supporters in my family, I can agree that EVERY Trump voter is not homophobic, racist, sexist and stupid, but I do think the singular commonality is a lack of EMPATHY toward the """"other,"""" -- the undocumented immigrant, the low-wage worker who needs some welfare assistance to live, the gay/lesbian couple who dares to desire legal marriage despite the long-established heterosexual norm, even those who have not been able or willing to take advantage of near-free education and thus be more able to provide their own health insurance.  I've seen a distinct lack of willingness to even try to empathize with people in any situation where circumstances/luck/decisions have been poor, or where someone expresses an individuality not labeled acceptable by the great amorphous majority.  I think it's unfair to assume the """"isms"""" belong to people whose worst failing is a lack of empathy, who simply cannot or choose not to wear another's shoes for 5 minutes.

Maybe the values that most people agree on are life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Islamic immigrants could easily get a list of what """"our values"""" are and take a quiz and say they agree 100% with what """"our values"""" are. Maybe after that Trump will have an idealogical test for American citizens to see if they agree with """"our values"""" and whoever doesn't pass gets sent to an """"our values"""" re-education camp.

0,"The problem is that there are no media outlets that will objectively analyze Trump's rationale for implementing the ban. Trump claims that he is implementing the ban due to """"medical costs"""" after consulting with generals.  If it's true that transgender people impose an extraordinary medical cost on the military, then the rationale is sound. It would be the same rationale for not allowing grossly overweight people into the military. I'd like to see a media organization perform an objective analysis on this, but an objective analysis by most media orgs, especially the left of center ones, is next to impossible. The media is too busy selling fear, emotion and anti-Trumpism to bother with facts.

There were people charged in that one, and an office that was raided and an organization that was taken down. Have they never heard of ACORN?  Come on now.  They simply MUST be lying.  Everyone who knows anything about politics knows about these cases and many more.  That then leads you to ask WHY they are lying.  This leads to a part of the Deep State Establishment that is led by the Never Trumpers, because he wants to tear down their playhouse.  Don't buy it.

After some Republicans called for only Syrian Christians to be allowed into the U.S. in the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, Obama called such potential policies “shameful.” “That’s not American.

In looking at Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch, my assessment is that Garland is a liberal only slightly to the right of Elena Kagan. His appointment to the court (Obama's 3rd) would have swung the court hard left for the next 25 years, because it's not just his vote that counts, but when you combine Obama's existing extremely liberal appointments with the two liberals already on the court from previous presidents and the reliably liberal-leaning swing vote of Kennedy, that would leave Thomas and Alito to uphold the constitution and the mushy-in-the-middle Roberts and Souter to join Kennedy as the swing votes.  Gorsuch, otoh, is right of center but far to the left of Antonin Scalia, so steers the court toward the left without slamming the rudder all the way over.

Trump and his Treasury Secretary are pandering to a politically connected lobbying group of wealthy landowners under the guise of supporting US jobs - this decision will hurt US businesses and the US economy in terms of more expensive building costs. The lobbyists are more concerned with their personal interests and couldn't care less about the impact on the overall US economy - no one wins in trade wars. The Chair of the group is also the VP of Shuqualak Lumber out of Mississippi - the US side has lost consistently at the WTO and NAFTA but they couldn't care less when it doesn't suit their interests. Charlie Thomas III and US Lumber Coalition - southern country club billionaires with political connections. Not a surprise from Wilbur Ross but still incredibly frustrating for Canadians.

0,"Yes Canada could get caught in the crossfire but only if the Canadian Government screws up.  The simple fact is -- Canada may have a merchandise trade surplus with the USA (greater when the price of oil is high) however the overall trade deficit with the USA is a deficit for Canada when you include services and tourism.  i.e. Canadian tourists spend far more in the USA than Americans do in Canada.  The Canadian Trade Representatives need to continually point this out to the Americans.  Trump is not an idiot, he will recognize this.  On a side note, with Junior and his policies I do see a 60 cent dollar in the horizon.

As a foreign government, there is little we can do to exercise influence over any other country, let alone the U.S. You may have noticed that nobody cared that Mr. Trudeau was there other than Canadians. We can't control their immigration policy. We can't control their economic agenda. We can't control their view on diversity. We can exercise some influence over trade because we trade with them on a very significant level.  The women's leadership roundtable was brilliant, working through the back door to achieve influence.  We have to live with this guy (Trump) for the next 4 years, at least, so we need to start with small achievements.  If you want to tell Mr. Trump how to behave vis-a-vis the citizens of the country of which he is president, you should feel to exercise your influence over him. I'm sure he'd be interested.

In Hawaii a legislator just introduced a bill to try to get a law if not a discussion going about that very real scenario. What I said, if you go back and read it, is that the working poor voted for Trump because of the despair they feel at working hard and not being able to provide a better life for their families then what their parents had. Trump hit a cord with those folks, no so much because they are racists or a bunch of ignorant bigots. They are scared and frightened about how they are going to provide for their families. Putting honest thought to the scenarios you mention is something that should be happening. Encourage more people to return to farming ? Provide educational opportunities for robotics now ? Look at the technology of the future now and implement programs NOW to empower people for the times that are a coming. Survive Trump.

All politics aside, if I were any of these performers I would have to wonder if it was a good career move to perform at the the event. Given Trump's low numbers in the popular vote and his current approval ratings, declining might be a better career move.
"
0,"When it comes to the question """"what did Donald Trump say?"""" and """"what official evidence and data do we have?"""" the journalist at least has to adhere to that objective reality. You cannot fudge the data and you cannot twist the words and deliberately mis-quote. Often times for everything there's audio or video in its ENTIRETY anyways.  Look at what Outsider said when I mentioned Trump talking about the murder rate. """"Well he could have just been talking about Chicago"""". He wasn't. He said """"in our country"""" and he's made that false claim multiple times. It is objectively not true according statistics. So either he is lying, or he is incapable of finding out truth for himself – even when faced with a correction. Either are terrifying. The journalist just connected the dots for you - look at the dots yourself, then decide if you can determine what is true. If you need Donald Trump to filter reality for you there's real trouble. He is not the arbiter of truth. Logic and reason are.

The media are desperate for Mr Trump to fail but seem to be getting out on another limb with these endless dire forecasts that could parallel their elections failures. I watched his news conference. Yes, he is a buffoon and an erratic. But what hit me was his grip on what he wants to do. He wants to create jobs. He wants to get a better grip on immigration. He wants to stand up for America internationally and he is super enthusiastic.  Do we really dislike those things so much that we pray for his failure? We are beginning to look a little pathetic clinging to the old ways. Maybe the old ways are more comfortable. Maybe we don't care about the problems of all those people who voted for him. Maybe we're all getting a little old and stodgy. Having said that, I am 70% cash, waiting for a correction to get back in. Mr Trump paid for my reno. Thanks Donald.

The media foolishly used Trump as an entertaining ratings raiser and simultaneously as a would-be scapegoat to make Hillary and the establishment look good. They gave trump a free ride at the front of the bus and also gave Hillary a free ride at the back of the bus. Both backfired. And when it became obvious Bernie Sanders was the most popular candidate in America, one who would have easily defeated Trump, they ignored him. The liberal establishment blew it. They and their middle class supporters deserve all the criticism they're getting and all the hand wringing they're going through. But politics is merely entertainment that sells newspapers and TV ads. It's economics that count.

Why are we backing the aggressors? NATO loses credibility with every statement like this.  We are the bullies here, and are clearly trying to start a war with Russia, and have since 2014. The whole world will lose this war if NATO gets their way. At least Mr. Trump in the US appears to recognize this insanity to some extent, and is asking NATO to prove its case, while giving Russia a chance to exist.
