At least Bannon is close on this one we he said...""""he's got about a 30% chance of finishing out his term"""".  The only question remaining. is how will it all end, and will he try to get away with taking the whole COUNTRY, or even WORLD, down with him, into his own HELL?  Here's hoping the suicide pact Mattis, Tillerson and Mnuchin have, has an attached rider for a presidential sequestration into the nearest mental hospital for poor, poor, liddle Donnie. Paging Dr. Krauthammer.  Yes, October is actually National Sarcasm Month. Perfect timing. WE ALL ARE GOING TO NEED IT.

0,"It's always disappointing, to say the least, when the word """"elite' becomes a pejorative term. Well-informed   people of all stripes are nowadays subject to routine abuse from some of the most ignorant members of society. Anti-intellectualism is on the rise. The spectacle of blowhards like Trump being applauded as a progressive force is beyond belief. Now, in Canada,  a once-proud political party (no longer conservative) flirts with the same divisive lunacy that we see elsewhere. It can only end in tears. If people are uninterested in history, or unwilling to examine the ideologies behind some of these so-called """"common sense"""" revolutions, then they are ripe for demagoguery. Trump is what you get when """" the best lack all conviction, and the worst are full of a passionate intensity."""" Mr Segal has, for some time now, provided  a trickle of sanity for those devoted to the true conservative movement in Canada. .Perhaps if he weren't a member of the elite more people might believe him.

0,"Actually Trump got more Latinos and blacks than Romney.  Here's a statistic you won't see on MSNBC  The """"received""""  statistic is that Trump got the """"white non college educated male vote"""" The fact is it was close...trump got 49% of that, with hillary getting 45% of it.  Not that big a difference.  The statistic you won't see the liberal press reporting is this one:  Hillary got a huge percentage of the black non college educated male vote.

0,"The Republican tide of the last 40 years has reached its high-water mark.  Trump’s antics and the GOP’s determination to rob 24 million people of their health insurance have ignited a progressive response every bit as passionate as the birth of the Tea Party.  The likelihood of the GOP losing control of Congress next year keeps growing.  All this should have the effect of causing the party to re-examine its politics.  That is what the party leadership needs to do: focus on policies.  Rep. Tupola’s focus on candidates is misguided.  Even if she finds good ones, to quote that great sage of the GOP, Sarah Palin, that would be like putting lipstick on a pig.  The local GOP has already produced great candidates such as Gil Riviere and Aaron Ling Johanson, and great young candidates, such as Beth Fukumoto.  They were all forced to quit because the party’s current ideology is so despicable.  Forgive me for being self-referential, but I’m going to re-post a comment I made last month…
"
0,"Perhaps you should actually read and try to inform yourself.  No - she did not """"destroy""""  all the evidence. And wouldn't you think that since the GOP vultures have been so wildly over the top about Clinton's emails that they would seek to not make that mistake?  But of course, you give Kushner a pass even though he should have known better and is not above the rules that the Clinton investigation brought to light and you and yours cry bloody murder about. No - of course they think they don't have to play by the same rules as the rest of us and are above the law.  I also find that the hypocrisy surrounding the emails to tRump junior, Kushner, Manafort, Flynn and meeting with the Russians is really really funny...and highly disturbing in context with tRump at his rallies calling Hillary crooked and calling for her to be locked up when it is tRump and his associates that don't adhere to the law, convention, rules or truth.

0,"There should be absolutely no impeachment, yet. I'm having too much fun seeing my predictions of what a complete disaster a Trumpster presidency would be.  Seriously, the Trumpster is just starting to self destruct. Let's give him time to crumble completely before sending him packing in complete, and total disgrace. In the meantime let's enjoy the show.

0,"At what point in the main stream media will they take responsibility for fanning the flames of hate against Republicans? MSNBC? CNN? Liberals? Speak up. When Julius Caesar depicting Pres. Trump's murder opened to standing ovation, that's all normal Americans have to know about the violence of the alt left, encouraging the mentally unstable to action. That Democrats don't speak up against it is the disturbing part.

0,"You can also point to the well-known fact that Lindberg was a NAZI extremist and virulent anti-Semite whose America First movement was a nativist, isolationist movement sympathetic to Hitler, anti-Semitism. and national socialism. Shades of Trump-Putin.  Republican dominance at the state level is the deliberate product of two engineered devices: extreme gerrymandering and selective voter suppression/disenfranchisement.  Republicans were a true majority in 1925 or so; but they are now a distinct minority. As the Crash of 1929 was preceded by an international tariff war, a crashed Trump economy could cause an explosive enlargement of the Democratic base, working families whose interests are in no way served by Republican government.

0,"I would suggest to Pres. Trump that he create a massive infrastructure program that focuses on upgrading our highway system in every state. Create a program to administer it, something like the Civilian Conservation Corps for the depression. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps Make it a massive on the job training program. Recruit the (don't take a job, your welfare bennies get cut) unskilled/low skilled workers to work on these projects These people start pushing a shovel digging dirt then move up as they learn a skill/trade.

1,"I don't agree Mr. Trump is a racist, but racism also exists in all people of all races, black race included. Muhammad Ali, Lyndon Johnson, many were racists, Elderidge Cleaver loved talking about raping white women, Ali racial inter-marriage, Johnson was a racist. Heck the Nation of Islam had George Lincoln Rockwell sitting proudly up front with his pals, all in full Nazi regalia surround by hundreds of Blacks who they had things in common with! It's in all races, and today even our universities like Harvard, where Asians are discriminated against.  But either way as I said before, your past issuance of personal insults to myself and others, leave little to be constructive, and I decline further discussion with you respectfully Q HALL, AMBER COLLINS, DALE GROSS, or whatever moniker you've adopted to use today respectfully. Have a wonderful evening.

0,"OMG. Some of these comments are based on thin air. Fact. When Obama signed the DACA Program as an Executive Order, it was because the stupid Republican lead congress CHOSE not to act upon it, stating that only the congress could enact such a program. They argued about the merits all the while knowing they wanted no action in order to see Obama fail. So Obama decided to use a squeeze through measure that would allow for a Presidential Executive order to enact this program. The response would be that the congress would have to sue the White House for a decision. The few Republican holdouts came from red states that did not care about these children. However, the Republican leaders choose not to sue and instead let the program remain. Trump has been threatened by the same Republican holdouts that they will sue if he doesn't rescind the order, which he has the right to do. Instead of standing up to these bullies, he caved. Leaving it up to congress. Nothing will get done.

0,"So right on Brett. I am a retired Army Officer and I have experienced first-hand the disgusting, aggressive, disrespectful types of comments made by Trump. In retrospect these types of comments were designed to deter women in the military from advancing in the good ol boys anti-woman culture.  I was often the first - among the first 40 women in signal repair, the first full-time Reserve Officer to sit on a NY Army Reserve General's staff, so I got the brunt of the initial backlash.  As a journalism major, I learned that one of the central functions of a free press is to decide what gets attention, as you said, to set the agenda. That was in the early 80s. Television had not yet reached the pervasive level of influence that it has today. So yes, the press bears a responsibility for perpetuating the misogyny that is still rampant in our society.  I applaud you for pointing that out in this respected news source.  Your words will help the women of Hawaii and the men who love them.

Incredible to think that a US president will be treated like that in Britain, but this individual will be.  The US Bishops are now being asked where they stand. I hope Francis turns the heat up under them and that decent Catholics across the country do the same.

You can only use """"shock treatment"""" so many times before it becomes ineffective.  First of all, there has been no evidence discovered that there ever was any even clandestine involvement by the President in any Russian connection let alone any connection to an effort to influence the American election process.  Every agent investigator agrees upon that fact.  No one needs to make a comparative analysis of what Obama would be responsive to had he been in President Trump's position.  Mr. Obama helped to perpetrate the myth that the President has Russian ties.  Maybe you don't remember the Obama promise to work closer with Russia """"once the election is over""""?  If there is a conspiracy here it has been perpetrated by the liberals and the liberal press and it is waste of our elected officials' time.

0,"On two important policies — sanctions on Russia and health care — a working majority of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate has already thwarted Trump.  Another bipartisan majority appears to have formed against Trump’s threat to shut down the government unless he gets significant funding for a wall along the Southern border.   In fact, on any number of issues, there are enough anti-Trump Republicans in the Senate not only to block the president but also to push their own policies contrary to the president’s — as was the case with Russia sanctions.

Mr. Blowhard was left looking pretty stupid when his """"terrific"""" health care plan went down in flames.  The same will happen here. Both houses are non-protectionist free traders. Trump said of his health care defeat: """"Gee, who would have thought health care is so complicated?"""" Six months from now, he is going to be saying something equally vacuous about NAFTA.

People are not going to put up with years of road building to support the required truck traffic, carrying building materials and people along their property, disrupting their businesses.  They've been very vocal about that (I don't need to follow your ridiculous suggesting about asking them) which is why no one in the Texas congressional delegation supported Trump's idiotic idea.

Front one: Donald Trump’s Foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund in 2008, but the organization says that donation does not exist, Fahrenthold reports.  This is the third charity that told the Washington Post reporter that the Trump Foundation’s tax forms were wrong when claiming they gave them money. He said he gave them money but they got none. So this doesn’t look like a “mistake”.  Now you know why he doesn't want to release his tax forms.

President Trump has nothing to prove to his voters and supporters regarding his elections.  The anti-POTUS factions will not yield to any facts or evidence.  Many are swamp inhabitants who want to create as much interruption and delay to the WH agenda as possible.

0,"How can this be, when the popular vote is going to Hillary, and since 1972, Catholics have voted for the winner of every election but this one?  So there is no evidence that Catholics """"enabled"""" Trump's victory.   True, many pro life Catholics were excited by Trump's pro life stance, but correlation isn't causation.  Pro life Catholics have always voted for the more pro life candidate....and there doesn't seem to be evidence that there are more pro life Catholics than Latino Catholics whose first priority is amnesty and open borders.  Hard to have dialogue when dealing with progressive claims made out of thin air, that sadly, a great many other progs up-voted here.  But here's some good news -- election is over, Hillary was utterly defeated, and Trump won!  Oh well, it makes me happy :)

0,"Gary, all your information about Trump is from the media and the media is not broad or diverse.  Mainstream media is quite monolithic in attitude and mindset.  Journalists feed off of one-another.  Every speech or interview of Trump's you have heard has been interpreted by the media and you have been tutored in the meaning you should get from what he said.  I believe it is an illusion to believe that you really have any independent opinion of Trump or any impartial or neutral overview of his life, beliefs, or intentions.  Most of what I like about Trump is simply that he will not allow himself to be defined by the media.  He dares to be his own man and stray from the lifeless monotone of conformity.

The proper echo of that basic pattern (tyranny of the majority against a minority) in modern US politics is the Trump administration determination to remove/prevent entrance to specified ethnic/religious minorities.  But this moron appears to want to associate his group (white America?) with the persecuted minority, implying that the powerful nations perpetrating the atrocity is Islam? Mexico?

There is though a war breaking out. Elites have been warned.  These emperors of willful propaganda, slander, and misinformation are gradually being exposed for the gulags they have become.  One does not have to think Brexit, Trump, Catalonia, or the melt down of socialism in Venezuela is a good thing.  But take it as a warning.

That is not the issue, since nobody is stopping Trump critics from expressing themselves. The problem is with the double standards which have become so deeply entrenched they are now taken for granted by some. Criticizing Trump is probably a way to enhance your career opportunities in Hollywood, as well as fit in with the Hollywood crowd. Many of these anti-Trump celebrities have virtually no formal education, and don't sound particularly bright when they don't read a script written by somebody else, and yet they have no problem making derogatory comments about the education and intelligence of millions of Trump voters they know nothing about. Apparently, attacking somebody's looks, intellect, and family, and being extremely intolerant of anyone with different political views is just fine if you are anti-Trump, but disagreeing with the anti-Trump crowd is unforgivable.

The nation has enough challenges paying for the healthcare costs of brave service men and women that have sacrificed mind and limb fighting for the country; in order that they may resume a semblance of normal life. Transgenderism is an aberration. It has nothing to do with saving of life and limb, return to normalcy or improving the nations fighting force.

0,"What lawyers argue in court doesn't necessarily affect how the judges decide. In matters before the Supreme Court, they will abide by the US Constitution. It gives the president wide latitude in security matters affecting the USA. And as any reasonable person understands, and what we've all witnessed, is that there's an elevated risk of terrorism at home or abroad if your armed forces are at war in another country.  As it happens, at the moment the US is making war in a number of predominantly Muslim countries. Had it been in the past, the target nation might have been Vietnam, or Japan.  Regardless, the affected nations contain only a small portion of the world's Muslims. Arguing that Trump's order constitutes a ban on people due to their religion is clearly a losing argument.  My personal view is that the USA should stop making war in other people's countries. But if you accept that they are, you should have zero difficulty accepting Trump's EO.

They believed either the DOJ would halt its appeal in the case or the administration would seek a rules change from the Department of Health and Human Services.""""

There are cities in Puerto Rico which have been visited by Fema only to have people fill out forms requesting aid and after 4 visits the people are told it is up to their mayor to get what they need, not Fema. Even Shepard Smith at Fox just described Trump as becoming more and more Nixonian (and not in a good way). Jeez, how can you defend this guy? He has been in office nearly a year and has literally accomplished nothing. No major legislation passed, and all he can do is whine about people criticizing him.

0,"In the advancement of civil rights for disenfranchised groups it has always been one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back, etc. With the election of Trump and his Republican Congress we just took five steps back in terms of gay advancement.  In today's NY Times there is an article suggesting that the focus on transgender rights is what put Trump in the White House. I have no doubt that that's at least partially true. Ever since last summer's Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay civil marriage the culture warriors on the right have been seething. The voting booth last month was where they took their revenge, and they won.  Despite Trump's supposed gay positive stance, he's populated his cabinet with the most conservative anti-gay people imaginable, and he's already reneged on  several campaign promises. I have every reason to believe he will quietly play to the extreme right where gay rights are concerned and gay people will lose. Compromise? I don't think so.

I gave away detectors in Joyce until the commissioners officially reprimanded me for """"an ethics violation ~ financial impropriety"""" because I'd offered them $500 to seed the program and they refused it, citing non-existent liability exposure. Their insurance agent denied there was any liability but the proud commish's said they knew better, so an ethics violation remains on my record at FPD4, even after these fools went to a state commissioners conference and were told there is NO liability for giving away detectors.

More and more of his columns seem to be this way, perhaps  just because he owes the NY Times a column, but has no idea what to write, thus he defaults to anti-Trump drivel which will always pass muster with the Times. Why the R-G wastes space reprinting this is the question. Perhaps they have prepaid for a certain number of Krugman's columns and so have become victims of his intellectual retirement.

If this supposed carbon tax is just going to be put into general revenues the the entire population of the country should be against it.  I urge the people residing in both B.C. and Alberta to find out from their governments where the carbon tax monies are going.  The people of Canada must stand up. There is to much complaining and not enough action to change the things we do not agree with.

Neither has the status of say a Colin Powell, to be an honest broker that could bring cooperation between the two major parties.  Neither of their Parties, (they are not independent), have the stature or public support, yet, to lead. I might well vote for either as Senator or Congressman.

No in that case Obama was constrained by the """"system"""" - He meant well but no conspiracies were in play.  But now  for Pseudo Psychologist Dixon it's all personal.

The concentrations of people with college education are in the cities, and they generally voted for Clinton.  You may be right and Trump voters blame our woes on liberal policies.  Where we disagree is whether or not they are correct.

Despite his apparent misogyny and bizarre temperament, many female voters supported him. I have lots of relatives, including a sister, living in the U.S. and their views on the man are mixed. My view is that I mainly care about his impact on the Canadian and world economies.  Getting sidetracked on issues like Trump's treatment of women, however lamentable, is a distraction that doesn't serve our interests.

1,"Some observations: Name 5 things Trump has done to benefit citizens.  He's completely failed to fulfill the 10 promises to be done in first 100 days.  What exactly has he done?  Trump doesn't exaggerate or mis-speak.  He lies.  No disputing national murder rate, trade deficit with Canada, date NATO agreed to full funding, or that there's been no proof of voter fraud.  He simply made crap up about all that and said it and it ain't true.  Period.  I think Burke's point is that if he lies on small stuff and gets caught on stuff easy to prove, how can you trust him to tell the truth on the big stuff that cant be proved?  The 7 examples cited aren't debatable.  Just plan FACTS.  He got 'em wrong.  So he either lies, is too dumb to know the facts or his staff is incompetent.  If a neighbor lied to you about stuff you knew about..would you trust them?  Of course not.  So how do we deal with Trump who is caught lying...like this am about Comey and classified stuff....which he didn't release.

Whether Syrian President Assad, authorized the bombing, is now brought into questioning, because of US Representative Gabbard.  What if US Representative Gabbard is correct?  Many people, have been coming up with excuses, to get rid of Syrian President Assad.  The USA, should not be directly involved, with President Assad's removal from office.  It should come from one of the 3 major Muslim factions.  If POTUS Trump, is directly involved, with the removal of President Assad, it could unite all of the Muslims, good & bad, around the world, to reign hell on anyone & anything, that is USA.

If it is true that nobody in your family, friends or even old acquaintances voted for Trump, then may I make a suggestion? There are a lot of people you pass by every day that you might not notice: delivery people, construction workers, people working in all those non-descript warehouses (flooring, glass doors, machine shops, etc.), small businesses selling stuff you probably don't need (equipment rentals, general contractors, lawnmower repair), and people who work in small office buildings (insurance, small banks, CPA's).

Your question, """"What does Carson's remarks at the Prayer Breakfast have to do with this news item?""""  Recalling this is not a trial.  Not much, really, unless one can reason Carson's display of ignorance in the presence of the president of the U.S. might reasonably be indicative of anything else he might say in a public venue. Carson for, perhaps, ulterior motives, took off his surgical gown to expose his darker side.  Nothing more evidential than to support Trump's presidency.  Trump's terrible demeanor during the presidential debates should have caused considerable concern. Your concluding analogy is a good one.

In fact, the terrorist attacks that have been carried out in this country were not perpetrated by those from the countries that the travel ban names.   Is the radicalism nurtured in Pakistan and Egypt no longer a threat?  Are they the good guys now?  There are several families that include men who worked with U.S. troops while they were fighting in their own countries who were finally cleared for entering the U.S., sold everything, spent thousands on plane tickets and were turned back literally at the last minute?

I have to believe that China's unquenchable thirst for Canadian Real estate, resources and access to the Canadian markets is going to be viewed as a threat and a target in these negotiations. Trump is going to make Canada choose between China and the States.  The MSM is going after the most liberal members of the White House, perhaps the leaks are coming from the most radical.

Trump will build the wall for 40 billion tops which is steep and I don't assume will work all that well without an increase in border agents. However illegals cost upwards of 200 billion a year in strain to the economy so I'd certainly choose a wall and increased agents if we're talking about the economical sense.

A failed test means North Korea has test feedback, and will improve the missile so the next one is successful. A successful test means that North Korea is already at that point. The difference in time between the two states of having a proven missile and having one that is close to proven but needs some bug fixing is likely much shorter than any possible military action towards North Korea - which likely would be disastrous, regardless of whether North Korea had this missile working or not. There needs to be a solution, but I don't see how that could ever be a military one, here. And the impact of this missile test's result is plausibly negligible - I don't think that Trump has to consider any different a scenario because this missile failed.

But none of that is Trump's fault, nor was allowing Comey to hold a presser last July when he should have just turned his findings over to Justice and kept his mouth shut. He should have been fired on the spot by Obama, or by Trump on his first day in office. Given that, and the outrage from both parties over Comey's behavior, how you can characterize Trump's reasoning for firing Comey as an attempt to halt an investigation (which is still happening) is nonsense.

And his children seem to be fairly successful. So, you think he's dumb? Really?

He still has half the voters in red states and the old industrial states. Surprisingly, he still has around 30% of the voters in California. I can't fathom why he'd have more than 1% of the vote. But whatever.  This is like your best friend in the world falling in love with the worst person possible, and being treated terribly. It is painful to watch.

1,"In other stories, we read that Kim is unlikely to launch a pre-emptive strike as he realises that would be the end of his reign and the destruction of North Korea. The real risk is that a fool like Trump would launch an attack on North Korea and Kim to feel that he has nothing to lose. Reminds me of Dubya's knee-jerk and irrelevant attack on Iraq after 9/11 - that pretty much led to what bin Laden wanted, American economic ruin and the riling up of all kinds of Muslim populations against the US and the West, including the rise of ISIS. I think there's far more benefit to working the diplomatic channels and reducing the proliferation of nukes than there is to building defence systems that can never be 100% effective.

The other point is that these Special Investigators often charge people with lying to investigators, almost as a consolation. The Scooter Libby matter in the Bush years, comes to mind.

In many ways Amazon is beginning to look like a monopolistic company that is in the process of very efficiently, economically,  and effectively overcoming all of its major competitors. Unfortunately for America  and for the Trump administration this presents a situation that will be less than  palatable once the full impact is understood.   Amazon is doing what it should do, specifically it is fighting in the market under the current rules and it is winning hands down.   One wonders where things will be in five years given the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, robotics, etc.  We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there is an economic equation that will replace the additional hundred thousand employees as soon as prifitable.

So far, he's been able to do that in only very short stints.  Voters must recognize that if he has to be someone other than who he really is in order to win, and if he can't sustain that pretense during the campaign, then if he is elected he will revert to his true self, with no restraint and little constraint.  He's a profoundly dangerous, emotionally stunted demagogue -- and Pence's determination to lie about him is implicit acknowledgement that Pence recognizes that, too.

They could not answer basic security facts on these illegals, or more likely, CHOSE not to, to keep the opposition, media, and thus the public ignorant. Thus the reason, likely, why, of Trump's newfound focus on the northern border.  One wonders if these genius professors, even did basic research by watching these hearings, so as to reach their ridiculous pronouncements that Canada 'is back', thanks to Trudeau's tweet that opened the illegal floodgate of likely criminals and terrorists coming here.

Given a choice between cuts to defense, infrastructure and health and human services and continuing to pay for these horses the decision seems easy. At least fo those who realize we are on the road to bankruptcy. Are these cuts the only, and final, answer?  Absolutely not.

One proof of that is to ask oneself if there has been a difference, for example, in the `news' being broadcast from CNN `News' compared to Fox `News' on President Trump.    Of course, the answer is yes, and I think this is a good example of Fake News.   The Media needs to be held partly responsible for all the hatred and division in America.   In the very least, a `News' media outlet should be broadcasting only factual occurrences under the umbrella of `News'.    Currently, the credo of American journalism is to hold someone's feet to the fire, but this often leads to extreme pettiness and repetitive critical nagging behaviour from the Media.

So we got the least qualified PM in modern history.  Even Joe Clark was smarter, steadier and better informed than Justin ever was.  Tomorrow, Trudeau and Harper will be in Washington on trade discussions, Trudeau with Trump, Harper at a blue ribbon conference with Gingrich, Wilbur Ross, etc.  If only we could switch the 2 PMs' schedules for Canada's sake even if for just a day!

0,"Regardless of what one thinks of Krugman, Trump's reverence for Vladimir Putin (and other dictators) is an ominous indication of how he would govern.  Putin, of course, knows exactly how to use Trump's schoolboy admiration.  The GOP's win-at-any-cost attitude plays right into his hands.

0,"No, actually our largest lender is, surprise!, our government itself via the Social Security and Medicare trusts, and the Federal Reserve Bank. They hold about $8 trillion of our debt. China holds a little over $1.2T and has been dumping it and buying yuan for the past year to prop up their currency. Yet we still buy lots of goods from them. Other state and local governments, and U.S. companies and citizens own over $5T, so about two thirds of the $19T national debt is owned by U.S. interests and the remainder by foreign interests.  Our government buys its own debt by, you guessed it, printing and creating dollars, which makes the dollars you own worth less because their value is diluted. That is how we give away so much free stuff! This should make you mad if you are or ever expect to be a taxpayer. Nothing is ever free, the costs are just hidden or passed to our children. It would be good if we stopped doing this. Hillary won't stop, Trump might or might not. I'll pick Trump.

The plan looks a lot llke Trump's campaign tax plan which was a huge boondoggle for the rich, but need more detail on this plan and how it works. One question is will corporations with funds overseas and paying zero US coroporate taxes bring cash and income back to the US to be taxed a 15%? Or will they stay overseas and take advantage of lower taxes, zero us taxes, and lower labor costs? Will corporations with cash from their tax reduction choose to make job generating investments or give it to consumers in lower prices. Or will they do what they are doing now which is to use most of their cash to buyback shares to enhance the share value of the company in a rising stock market? The buybacks make shareholders and management a lot richer.

More piteousness trying to confuse inflexibility with holiness. It seems, by the way, that you seem to not care about the other two sins, which Trump seems to promote as good Capitalism.

0,"The point is it did not matter whether Clinton or Trump got elected. None of Trump's campaign promises came to pass, zero. So he does a diversionary dance (via Twitter) for his voter base every couple of days. I cannot believe the energy people here waste on getting bent out of shape over such obvious political theatre.  Correct, the Health Insurance lobby beat Obama on single payer, so much for his alleged presidential powers. So to conceal his failure he made sure Congress wrote a convoluted """"most expensive possible health care"""" bill that no one could understand and then spent the rest of his 2 terms spinning it as his signature achievement.  Putin stopped the global corporate corruption in Russia and instituted Russia first corporate corruption. That is a bigger accomplishment than you might think, certainly more than Obamacare (who knows why he wants his name on that fish wrapper).

0,"Some here like to remind us of America's transgressions, of its international meddling (Latin America, MidEast) as if we didn't know -- maybe they can name a superpower of its time that didn't act like one and throw its might around -- but let's not kid ourselves. Canada can't duck away to a neutral site like a football team seeking another venue during a home-field weather crisis. We're a Western nation, a U.S. and European ally (whatever the legitimate doubts re- Trump, or the cheap shots re- Trudeau from the usual juveniles). We can attempt mediation but I doubt North Korea will be impressed, any more than it is with sanctions. If China still finds Kim useful, there is little that can be done; at only 33 years old, he can continue his blackmail for decades, South Korea and Japan his hostages. His end would have to come from within, from the suicidal intervention of a rogue bodyguard or humiliated general or hired assassin. But then what? The North is nuclear now.

0,"I know exactly what you are doing, trying to change the narrative to something else rather than what it is.  This is a common tactic as soon as someone can't make an argument on its merits.  It is called changing the subject.  This story is about Fake News, not fake politicians (all of whom are woefully fake).  Fake News is about reporting things that are untrue, being biased, not providing the whole truth, etc.  It is the job of the media (or the good media, I should say) to report the facts.  It is like a court of law, you have to have facts and the truth.  Mr. Trump (or any politician) may be a cesspool of lies and untruth, but that doesn't absolve the media from doing their job.  Bringing up Mr. Trump as an example is a non sequitur.  It isn't a question that he lies - I think everyone knows this.  The story is about the media.  If they want people to have trust in them, they have to earn it.  They can do so by reporting lies and the facts with them, as one way to earn trust.

This was a change election and Hillary was the wrong person for the Democrats to put up against Trump, but the Democratic establishment are so wedded to corporatism and militarism that they put their thumb on the scale for the weaker general election candidate because they didn't want someone like Bernie to shake things up.

0,"The greatness of the American experiment (so far) has been that, while America is a majority Christian nation, it is fundamentally a pluralistic one that has made room for all religions and those who profess no religious affiliation at all.  As a Christian, I don't want a Muslim telling me what I ought to believe any more than I want the late Jerry Falwell or his Trump-supporting son telling me what I ought to believe. The fact that we've made room for everyone to believe in whatever or whomever they want or nothing at all is our greatest strength as a country.  Why anyone, religious or otherwise, would want to trade that in for a terrifying theocracy like Iran or Saudi Arabia, a moribund state religion on life support like Anglicanism in England, or a stultifying atheism as existed in communist China, is beyond me.

Other bad ideas not being addressed: 1– increasing up front taxes on middle class investment in 401K’s to pay for big cuts for corporations and the wealthy; 2- Cutting the mortgage deduction for mortgages (another middle class benefit) which is leading to objection to tax reform from one of the largest lobbyist groups in the National Homebuilders; and 3- Expanding the deficit to a level that can never be paid down enough by growth in tax revenue after all the proposed cuts. Another idea that has been shot down is cutting the state and local tax credit which goes to the most politically powerful states.

Why do so many people ignore this significant fact.  Investing now has huge risks with trump at the wheel. I wouldn't be surprised if you are down 20% a year from now.  Paying down you mortgage is a guaranteed 6% after tax return on a 3% mortgage and you will be much further ahead with non of the anxiety.

0,"None of that is relevant to anything. None of it even matters. The reason Trump is the """"least popular"""" incoming President is simply because this was the most bitter fought election in US history. There are plenty of Americans complaining about Trump even though they didn't even bother to vote. Lots of people came to see Obama's inauguration simply because it was something different to see a black President being sworn in.

Yes, she did stand but also very mobile as well and I will admit that at 68, she may have been affected, but she was diagnosed as having pneumonia on Friday and placed on antibiotics.

I spent 20 years in the Navy and did see a number of people who stood at attention in 90+ degree heat for an hour or more collapse and faint. They were all fine after about 5 minutes, not staggering and having to be held up. Boot Camp in San Diego in June, July and August.

For one thing, many of those voters in rural areas and left-behind small towns and cities happen not to be all that underprivileged, to judge from the crowds who turned out for the campaign rallies. The matter of slighted dignity was surely a factor in the outcome of this election, as in many political developments everywhere. But voting for Trump, by way of """"getting back"""" at the """"elite,"""" was hardly a praiseworthy moral reaction.  That said, it is true that already a long time ago Democrats and liberals got themselves into trouble when they let themselves be called """"elite,"""" a term that used to belong to GOP plutocrats. And we were wrong to fail to address the ill effects of the shifting economy.

First and foremost, let's get one big lie and false equivalency out of the way. What the GOP is doing is absolutely nothing like what President Obama and Congress did when the ACA was enacted. Hundreds of hearings and meetings occurred to form the ACA, and many GOP compromises were included in the bill. The GOP plans are being contrived by a limited number of conservative-minded zealots behind closed doors, sprung on everyone with zero requests for feedback or input from most of Congress (but hey, let's allow Ted Cruz to add his own brand of insanity to the bill!), then they continue to attempt to ram rod a haphazard collection of harmful garbage down everyone's throats.

The NFL Operations manual says players are to stand during the anthem, but I guess they're not enforcing it because they've figured they'll lose less money (from sponsors, etc) this way. Players will not protest the $US, they're happy to play anywhere, without allegiance, to get as many of those as they can, even when they're already worth hundreds of millions.  Of course the sports industry, including the sports channels and their employees, are standing with the players, it's where their money is too.  Good for Auston Matthews for thinking for himself, it redeems my view of millennials who seem addicted to hive-thinking.  I'm surprised NFL thinks this is in their interest, as their audience is mainly uneducated deplorables who like Trump and flag - I didn't think high-falutin people with univ degrees were big on NFL or pro sports in general.

They will have to fight hard for the constitutionally guaranteed right to a free press. They have to pound that drum so that the public understands that the public of the US can demand and should get unvarnished facts and stories based on excellent research. Less than that, the press will have to be written off as a source of public information.  Intimidation from any source should be vilified by the public.

We've been here a million times before, with every president. All the evidence is in, but no charges are even being talked about.

0,"I use aggregate poll mean and median paying attention any mode in the group. I hate the term approval rate as it is, in my mind, less of an indicator than the disapproval rate. Folks, if you believe Trump is doing well in any poll, your mistaken. Ramussen's most recent poll had Trump at a 57‰ disapproval rate. The election does poorly in picking a winner when a minority vote candidate wins by electoral college win. Clinton obtaining 3% more popular vote does not help when the electoral college decides an election and the polling needed to determine an electoral college win does not exist. Since it's only happened five times in 57 elections, it's just an """"oh, well"""" moment.  The only help may have been a very large survey number with only a .5% margin of error. The issue came in three states (MI, PA and WI). Since only 78,000 aggregate votes decided the election, even having Clinton up by 1% in those were well outside the margin of error.

0,"You should take her seriously, she's a serious woman with a lot of real world experience.

You can complain about some of her policies as Secretary of State (although please spare me Benghazi, which had nothing to do with her), but again it's clear she was a hard worker and understood what was going on in the world.  I have a lot of issues with Clinton, and am not necessarily happy she will be the nominee (though I know she will be), but I trust her to be a steady hand, to reassure our friends, and stand up to but not unnecessarily unsettle our enemies.  I wish I could trust her to be more of a friend to the middle class, and perhaps a bit less of a friend to the 1%, but I think she will feel more pressure to deliver for the middle class than Trump will.  Trump frankly exhibits none of Clinton's serious and reassuring qualities.

President Trump unequivocally condemned right-wing, anti-Semitic extremists.  He made the distinction between the neo-nazis and those who quite reasonably for decades have believed that such statues are beautiful art and represent the sacrifices made by their patrimony against barbaric, imperialistic Yank invaders who stole, vandalized, raped and burned their way through the South to establish Yank hegemony.  In an effort to demonize President Trump the lying MSM is falsely conflating his support for those who want to commemorate their soldiers and his absolute condemnation of anti-Semitic right-wing extremists.  The lying MSM also falsely criticizes President Trump for calling out the authorities who told the police to stand down and elements of the left-wing mob who were violent.  The  MSM coverage of President Trump is a lying hatchet job.

We went to war illegally in W's shock and awe campaign, partially to steal Iraqi oil and partially to divide Israel's enemies, all the while pretending it was about Saddam's nuclear weapons. But it was Israel who introduced nuclear weapons of mass destruction into the Middle East, and that will sooner or later result in many mushroom clouds. I personally think Palestine has as much right to exist as Israel, and until that happens, I see no reason for American support. But I am no one, certainly not one who has billions to buy off American politicians. Israel is an apartheid nation, as South Africa was, and to support such a nation while it is so abusive is a remarkably bad idea. Trump is Putin's puppy, installed to destroy America, as Ukraine's past leader tried to do, until a revolution forced him to flee. Hugh

For example, my receptionist, who is white and blonde, was previously denied entry and interrogated with her boyfriend, also white. Every time they cross now, they are interrogated.

This woman probably has something in her past or an associate who got in trouble with the law. Yes, unfortunately, those are the times we live in now.  Oh, and Canada deported 4500 Mexicans last year. So before pointing fingers at Trump who wants to deport criminal illegal aliens, Canada has been doing its fair share of deporting illegal aliens, as it should.

For  it is practically impossible to do a background check on most, if not all Muslim Refugees from a region that is unstable. Can one confidently believe that all Muslims refugees in a region infested by Muslim radicals are all innocent Muslims who can enter the US without danger to US security. Of course not. To believe is to be naive.

The proletariat are all equal in their misery. As long as the dictators are friendly and can offer the Liberals' corporate-globalist associates some business, this sort of thing can remain politely unmentioned.  The new-left has no problem with human-rights abuses by left-wing totalitarian governments, whether China or Cuba or Venezuela, instead finding a new outlet for their anti-Americanism in the Trump feeding frenzy. Reading through the comments here, it is astonishing how many of these ignorant people now actually say that Canada should try to replace our relationship with the US with one with China.

The budget that passed was put together in Congress.  The GOP fled from most of Trump's proposals because they are terrified of the reaction his tenure in the White House has ignited across the country and rightly fear being swept out of power in the mid-term elections next year.  In other words the alarm -or """"hysteria"""" as you dismissively label it- produced the desired effect.  But the threat has not disappeared. Trump will try again with the next budget to do enormous damage to the fabric of our nation.  So the alarm bells will continue to sound.  Finally, what global warming hysteria?  The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration is now predicting 5 to 8 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century.  I don't know if that is reason to be """"hysterical,"""" but it is cause for enormous alarm.

They were yelling stuff at a latino family at  an intersection, and when the light turned green they took off in a big cloud of black diesel exhaust. It reminded me of my youth in GA. I was pretty appalled. By now I've lived in Colorado most of my life, and I'd never seen anything like this here. It was very disappointing. The lack of widespread racism is one of the things that made me appreciate Colorado.

The problem is, I think, that only the majority can call for a special prosecutor or for an investigation that actually has teeth. The minority can call for an investigation but, in the past, the majority has shoved the minority's little investigation down to the basement and it wasn't given any weight or attention. To get a real investigation of the Trump team's potential collusion with the Russians, both before and after the election, we need Republicans to call for it, I believe. Republicans need to call for a Special Prosecutor with subpoena abilities. Rand Paul knows that only the majority can call for that. So, to say that """"Republicans shouldn't investigate Republicans"""", in this case, he's saying that there isn't going to be and shouldn't be a real investigation.

0,"The author overlooks a serious demographic shortcoming. The Republican Party is white and getting whiter. The country is going the other direction. The Trump campaign has been very much a white grievance campaign rather than a national unity campaign. That works for angry white people, but not for the country as a whole.  A few Republicans have tried to expand the party's appeal beyond white Americans, but they've been stymied by a base that's resistant to change. This is unfortunate. As I've said a million times, there is nothing in conservative philosophy that is inherently racist. Yet rather than try to understand issues facing minority communities, recruit candidates and offer alternatives to Democratic ideas, Republicans primarily seek to hinder minority voting. This is not winning them popularity with anyone but angry white voters.  Thus the party has become structurally white nationalist rather than conservative. There's no future for this approach. Nor should there be.

I think he's likely to try the latter strategy first in an attempt to leave the idiot standing.  Supposedly Bannon is going back to Breitbart.  He never left.

0,"Until now, those who advocate """"resist"""" or """"revolt"""" are unable to explain why and how Clinton who was supposed to win the election overwhelmingly, lost to Trump. No, this thing about Clinton winning the popular vote looks good but it is false because this so-called """"popular vote"""" did not come from the entire US of A but only from and only from California where she got over 60% of the vote. Really. Resist is not the answer. The answer is to discover and recognize the reasons why and how Clinton lost to Trump. Only when and only when those who advocate """"resist"""" examine and discover the reason why an overwhelming favorite as Clinton could even lose to Trump will advocates of """"resist"""" find the path to victory. Otherwise, """"resist"""" will only bury Democrats deeper and deeper into the hole they all dug for themselves in Election 2016

And he will reveal (postponed from """"Tuesday or Wednesday"""") the information that only he has about the hacking. Or he won't. I think Trump's problem with the intelligence community is this: I think Trump knows, or believes, that at least some people who work in the intelligence agencies know, or soon will, how and why he became Putin's lapdog. Therefore, he has to undermine them, even at the expense of the security and credibility of the United States. No denying, no minimizing: He's a reckless, dangerous man. I'm very sorry to hear about your rotator cuff pain. I hope and pray that you will experience relief and healing.

Why favour the fanboy of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which engineered the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Roma in Kosovo with NATO help? Biden gave a speech to an audience of Albanian-Americans that highlighted the Battle of Pristina in 1388. (He actually meant the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the most famous battle in Serbian history. It was like he called the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by another name and thought it was fought in 1065.) However Trudeau likely  sees in a politician who is ignorant and buffoonish a kindred spirit.

According to his definition, our only real ally must be Russia.  As far as comparing Trump to Reagan, let's remember that Ronnie put more than fear into our nation's enemies:  He also gave them infrastructure, weapons, and a hell of a lot of money---And we've spent much of our time since then cleaning up the mess (Saddam Hussein, Al-quaeda, Iran-Contra, to name a few) at the cost of lives and money and a gutted social network that loaded our streets with the homeless and our work force with the uneducated.  This guy speaks for the very neo-cons whose idea of America First really means the military take-over of the world.  I don't think that's in the Constitution...

He has told you that he is a sexual abuser, in his own words; that he enjoys mocking handicapped people and characterizing people by the ethnic group that they belong to; that he likes to see violent eruptions in his campaign rallies; that he loves war, wonders why he can't use nuclear weapons. These are not stories told by others (although others have confirmed them) but by his own mouth. Yet you won't believe him, but you will believe stories told by her enemies about Hillary Clinton?

This illustrates the problem faced by voters in most Western countries, where the established mainstream parties have in many instances ignored public discontent about issues like immigration and globalization. The parties and politicians that have picked up on this discontent are essentially fringe in most other aspects, a fact that seemingly permits writers like Sanders to cavalierly dismiss those who support them as low-knowledge voters and even bigots. Even Trump likely would have been cast pretty much as a fringe candidate had he not opportunistically capitalized on public concerns about immigration and globalization, although I suspect his ulterior motive is to enrich the already privileged.

In these discussions I'm hearing a lot of doubts expressed about Trump's ability to pick good leaders and make good decisions. That's primarily left-leaners who see things changing and mourning that their candidate lost. What gives me hope is that Trump is CEO of a complex and profitable $11B corporation. He didn't get there by being stupid and over the years he has developed a keen skill for evaluating people for their leadership abilities and putting them in positions where they can develop and deliver both growth and profits. So it will be interesting seeing how quickly and severely his management style conflicts with the entrenched bureaucracy and how much change he is actually able to drive. He has outlined an aggressive 100-day plan that I think is going to surprise a lot of bureaucrats by how quickly it knocks their ivory towers out from under them.

He said Mexican consulates in the United States have received at least three times as many daily phone calls from worried citizens there as before news of possible ramped-up deportations under Trump.

1,"The difference this election was that white voters in the Rust Belt that voted for Obama or did not vote at all the last couple of elections, voted for Trump this time. Obama did save the auto industry and went thru hell and high water trying to convince them that he cared about them. I know quite a few white men that would never accept a female leader, much less a strong assertive woman. They have been hating Hillary for 30 years. Their wives stood by their men. Like the mother of a cop that may think the Black Lives Matter movement is a threat to their child, those Rust Belt mothers feared many things that might endanger their families, like the opiate epidemic in Appalachia that is effecting mainly rural white folks.  They feared Hillary didn't care about them because she cared about minorities. In their mind, caring when it comes to minorities in general and black folks in particular, is a zero sum game. Black folks gave Hillary well over 90% of their registered vote voters.

0,"beyond the evangelical crowd who immediately disposed of their decades long self-presumed moral high ground of being values voters while tossing away any remaining speck of credibility along with all claims to the Christian faith, those who voted for Trump were primarily the ill informed, the totally uninformed, and the screw information because of an obsession with hating Hillary crowd, who for the most part would have shriveled up and blown away years ago had Obama not completely reversed W's nation killing economic collapse and put America back on a solid 7 year path to recovery and the strength we enjoy today for at least those with investment capital, and which will disappear in about 2 months if Mr. Disaster actually takes office. there was also a force of Hispanics, college ages, women, those ashamed to admit they'd vote for Trump, and your typical non voters, who all made a historically horrific decision to put an international bad joke in the world's highest office. not good.

1,"Trump is aberration of US politics.  A former Democrat who changed parties but seems to borrow from both. He is for tax cutting taxes which is Republican, infrastructure spending which is more Democrat  ( Trudeau is proposing the same thing) and anti free trade like Bernie Sanders ( and the Canadian labour movement).  His style of government seems more like business negations instead  of the more traditional politics. Which causes a lot of confusion as he seems to be more concerned in getting things done  instead of paying the traditional games.  Unfortunately for him the extreme right feel he is their candidate , which is questionable as his son in law is Jewish and American are anti sematic. He is also very thinned skinned which is not a good thing for a powerful politician.

0,"Trump is set to do just what GW Bush (controlled by Dick Cheney) did - effectively replace the EPA with the administration controlled CEQ, headed by Exxon Mobile executives, who replaced scientists in the Clinton CEQ. The CEQ pushed for billions in oil and coal subsidies, ignored its own scientists, and refused to replace aging climate-monitoring satellites. Trump denies climate change, and is doing a Cheney by appointing Rex Tillerson, whose entire working career has been in service to Exxon Mobile. Governor Brown, whom you just have to disparage as """"moonbeam"""" (but he balanced California's budget and has succeeded in restoring functionality to the state legislature) is exactly right to suggest that the new administration will push to dismantle all science satellites not exclusively useful for military purposes.  As for practicality, advances in electrical storage including new capacitors, and rapidly declining cost of wind power will replace much fossil fuel burning. That's practical.

He should have simply turned all the FBI had found over to the Justice Department and kept his mouth shut. Since Loretta Lynch had compromised herself by meeting Bill Clinton on the Phoenix tarmac a week earlier, she should have then recused herself and let Sally Yates handle it from there. But Comey instead took over, and since Obama didn't fire him on the spot, we might assume Comey was doing what he was told to do, meaning he allowed himself to become a partisan political stooge instead of an independent and non-partisan law enforcement officer. Or he overstepped on his own, knowing the conditions would allow him to wrest that power from Justice and get away with it. Either way, he should have been fired. The real question is why he wasn't fired much sooner. All that has followed as a consequence is only political gamesmanship.

Trump has no desire to advance truth and reconciliation when it comes to race in this country. His venality and vulgarity seeks only to exploit white racial anxiety and hostility, in the most vulgar of terms, to maximum political gain. With every passing day, Trump diminishes the office of the presidency and elevates a virulent strain of racial animus. Trumpism is becoming ever more synonymous with racism. -- or the Republican Party as a whole.

Clinton wanted to raise the taxes on the elite which could have negative consequences on employment but heck, most of those jobs are overseas anyway.

Seriously, health care will have to adopt single payer, and the ACA will not be repealed.  Tax reform will take them well into 2018, and will look nothing like what the WH has proposed.  Infrastructure will not ever happen on the scale the WH has proposed.  The WH vision for trade will only diverge over time with GOP interests.

If the two major parties don't like that, then they can use whatever method they are willing to pay for to generate a slate of candidates.

During Eisenhower's presidency the top marginal tax rate was somewhere around 90%, which is where it had been since immediately after the Great Depression when the American people through their congressional representatives decided that the robber barons on Wall Street who had caused the Depression needed to pay up after having stolen all the loot in the decades leading up to the '29 crash. Trump's team in collusion with his new Republican Congress will lower the top marginal tax rate from its current 39% down to 0% so the new breed of robber barons can cash in at everyone else's expense.  There are no apt comparisons between Trump and Eisenhower, who had been a general during WWII, so please stop trying to stretch reality in an effort to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, MSW. It won't do.

1,"Its funny watching the left twist themselves into knots defending religious views that literally oppress women.  This is why the left cannot be taken seriously on almost any matter. The same hypocrites who ranted and raved about Donald Trump were silent about Harvey Weinstein. They have marches and wear ribbons and talk about women’s rights and then say we have no right to step in when a religion oppresses women on what they can wear or do.  Meanwhile if a Christian says women shouldn’t be allowed to have an abortion they go ape**** protest and riot saying and I quote “no one should be able to tell a woman what to do with her body”. How the F is this any different?  The selective and hypocritical morality of the left should be ignored as it is nonsensical and illogical. The ban should stand, otherwise what the law is saying is all religions are equal, except for islam which will get an exception every time. Thus the beginning of sharia law.

They all 'admit no liability' but we all know they are just buying off the person(s) complaining.  Do you really want the U of O to go to trial and lose more money than if they settle out of court on the three cases they have pending?

He doesn't like something or someone and, after he's had his Big Mac and fries and extra large soda ( American notation) he'll prop himself up in his gold plated four poster bed and proceed to think out loud, on his iPhone. Or, maybe he's trying to prove that a couple of well timed tweets can lop a billion here or there off the book value of an American stock. Maybe he's trying to provoke Janet Yellen into raising interest rates higher than the anticipated quarter point. I'm sticking with his stock in trade; it's better to look good ( to the little people) than to have substance and principals. The hair, the jet, the big letters with his name on big buildings, the trophy wife, trophy daughter , what could be better? I think he thinks he's a king and not a president. Big difference.

Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that bowing down to a flag or saluting it, often in conjunction with an anthem, is a religious act that ascribes salvation, not to God, but to the State or to its leaders. (Isaiah 43:11; 1 Corinthians 10:14; 1 John 5:21) One such leader was King Nebuchadnezzar of ancient Babylon. To impress the people with his majesty and religious ardor, this powerful monarch erected a great image and compelled his subjects to bow down to it while music, like an anthem, was being played. However, three Hebrews—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—refused to bow to the image, even on pain of death.—Daniel, chapter 3.

The virtues this method of organizing economic activity possesses, and there can be quite a few, are negated if society fails to instill a national conscience onto those Capitalists proven to have none.

We see the disaster of corporate oligarchy but forget that the period of greatest equity was during Liberal control. Yet because people deliberately excluded from that equity demanded justice idiots voted """"my conscience"""" for racism and theocracy against their own economic interests and freed greed from all moral and legal restraint.

Congress still holds the purse strings, the Constitution has yet to be repealed, and the checks and balances of the US system are still in full play.  Trump has no experience and heretofore no interest in public policy of any kind. I doubt he's even aware of the basic functioning of the US gov't and the role played by the Executive branch. He's made many outlandish and contradictory statements simply because he doesn't know enough to offer a well formulated proposal.  I suspect he'll delegate most of the hard work to subordinates and go back to tweeting rants about celebrities at 3am.  The far, far bigger practical issue is GOP control of Congress. Those guys have significant power and hold the purse strings, and they are - with few exceptions - as unhinged as Trump et. al.

Judges don't decide guilt or innocence: politicians vote on the matter. There is no court of appeal.  The vast majority of both Republicans and Democrats are entrenched Establishment politicians. At best they all distrust Trump, probably many of them fear and hate him. Not because he's incompetent- the American system handles incompetent presidents all the time. Rather, they fear Trump because he's not one of them. He's a political outsider, and the US Establishment has little hold over him.

0,"Hi Anon, I posted about this piece earlier! I find it plausible, so I'd be interested in counterarguments. Zunger's case is built on information in the public domain from credible sources: Reuters, CNN, the Guardian, and so on (but then, that's the stuff of conspiracy theory!). The facts seem pretty stable. That leaves the analysis, which focuses on three elements:  1) the immigration executive order, attributed to Steve Bannon, that created confusion and chaos, sucked up media oxygen, and destabilized checks and balances;  2) the small number of powerbrokers in Trump's inner circle;  3) follow the money.  I'm again reminded, as I've mentioned several times in these threads, of the monumental import in 1933 of the intrigues of a small group of political actors that led to the unlikely installation of Hitler as Chancellor. Before the usual protests arise, I'm not comparing our present situation to the Weimar Republic-Third Reich. The point is: a cabal can change the course of history.

I can envision small pockets of racism, xenophobia, sexism -- but the GOP candidate has MILLIONS of people voting for his twisted vision of what constitutes a """"Great America,"""" and I find that fact terrifying.

0,"Exactly what rights is Trump trying to take away? And what responsibilities is he ignoring? If you'd read things like the Constitution and federalist papers you would understand that the federal government has few responsibilities and the President's main function is to see that the legislation is carried out. He cannot make law and using executive orders like Obama did to circumvent the law is treasonous in my book. By the way weaponizing the IRS and the NSA is actual examples of taking peoples rights away but of course none of you want to talk about that. By the way have you read Marx? I have.

You may not agree with any of Trumps rhetoric and methodology but by not cowering to the useless progressive ways of the past Trump has started making all nations realize the same old way cowering to an unstable regime can't continue and why China is now laying out their policy that they won't protect North Korea if they start things.  By simply saying bizarre things like expecting Mexico to build their own wall Trump has seen well over 60% drop in illegal crossings from Mexico since his inauguration because they know what to expect.

En Marche - Looking strong now, but lack of detail could come back to bite Macron.  Otherwise most popular but support soft.  Socialist Party - Better hope the Left Front collapses and the other three closely split their votes to make even the second round.  Needs to face Le Pen to have a chance even.

Perhaps you simply misunderstood Keynesian economics or perhaps you are just parroting what you've heard on Fox.

Bush the Elder's administration paid the price for the failed economic theory """"trickle down economics"""" aka Reagonomics.  Obama's administration did at least get the country recovering from the failed Bush policies of trickle down economics plus unpaid for wars in the Middle East. That extra 10 trillion in debt built after Bush left office, belongs to failed Bushonomics and an unfettered GOP Congress.

Climate is inherently more difficult to model due to the longer time frames, so you just dismiss those models are worthless.  Yet, climate models have been correct or, more recently, a bit too conservative with regards to the changes we are seeing worldwide.  The entire polar amplification has long been predicted and we've seen that in spades, for instance. The goal is not to redistribute global wealth - you misrepresent the issue for political gain - the goal is to save the earth, the most noble of cause of all.

How his supporters don't see the nerve of the guy is beyond me. No need to disagree, Trumpists, I know, I know: """"But her e-mails...but Obama...but Trudeau.""""

0,"Lee, Hillary did her share of roasting the Donald, also.  I am not pro Trump and think that he would be destructive as the President of the US.  He is so unpresidential, narcissistic (they just love me).  At the end of his turn, some of his over the top roasts did get booed, but I didn't get that they were boos of him specifically.  It sounded like there was one person at least directing boos to him with comment, though.  But, I thought that was in keeping with 'a roast'.  I'll listen to it again, but I didn't get that he was being assaultive.  They both made some really pointed roasty remarks.   Usually, I'm really on the hard end of being down on the man-child Donald, but not this time.  I find it refreshing, surprisingly.

If we had Catholics or Mormons producing radicalized zealots that were killing people all over the world we would be all over removing these threats! Religious freedom is not a pass for radicals to commit mass murder! Have we not learned anything from history and the dangers of religion? The Muslim community needs to immediately take a long hard look at their beliefs, their practices and find the root cause that THOUSANDS of Muslims are confusing Allah and mass murder as acceptable way to go to Heaven. The direct correlation is in front of us. Until Muslims figure this out, then ban the religion until this is resolved. Their religion doesn't trump safety!

Hopefully the police will remember they are part of the democratic community and not their rulers. Democracies are messy ways to govern, but still it is the best yet found.  I'm betting on the values instilled in our congressmen to assert themselves soon before the other two branches become irrelevant and all leaders will have to swear allegiance to the president himself like that shameful incident a few weeks ago with his cabinet and other staff.

The Clinton emails already released by WikiLeaks are evidence of a complex criminal conspiracy rising to the level of the president-the email between Hillary, the president and John Podesta and others is hard evidence-far beyond that required to convict in criminal court.  Also, people should look at the Project Veritas undercover video released today (its on YouTube under """"Rigging the Election-Part I"""") It is truly amazing what the Clinton campaign has done, working directly in coordination with her PAC's to have workers incite violence at Trump rally's-all federal crimes as well.

Is it a worse nightmare than we would have had with Hillary? I doubt it. It's just different. Everytime Trump does something I agree with, he follows up with something that makes me cringe.  Basically, what I'm saying is that government from afar by elites who think they know better than we do how to live our lives is no better than government from afar by Trump.  If Trump stepped down or was impeached, Mike Pence would replace him. Would you folks be happy with that or would the destructive behavior toward your own countrymen continue?

Aside from criminality, there is the possibility of Trump being so heavily invested in by multiple oligarchs, all secretly beholding to Putin, that Putin effectively could pull down significant segments of the Trump empire.  I can't imagine we won't eventually find out, given that Mueller is going after that angle.  If Trump were to get Mueller fired, do you figure Mueller will have arranged to secretly backup his data (electronic and documentary) lest Trump's minions raid and destroy.

If China declares war over Taiwan and the US moves to protect Taipei, all financial obligations between the two countries  are wiped out.  The question is how far will China go if Trump wants better relations with Taiwan?  There are other ways the debts can be re-negotiated,  for pennies on the dollar.

You need to articulate better than to suggest a bias opinion. You staunchly opposed Bush in agreement with William F Buckley who warned the GOP they were committing political suicide. Glad to hear.

0,"Trump has a LLC but it operates like a sole proprietorship from a tax structure from what I've heard so if true he may not benefit much from this and would also explain why he's guarding his tax returns from the public. Besides, many of the wealthy already gave away vast fortunes to endowments/charities like the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation so they have contributed to the common good far in excess than what the government goons would have done with the taxes they would have collected.  The tax cut is a good one, corporate taxation needs to be reduced otherwise corporations hire illegals and foreigners overseas to be more profitable. With the tax cuts looming for the government agencies, they should be scaling back since the government spending has grown out of control.

He personally saved two billion American jobs that were being outsourced to China just by """"doing a deal"""" with their leaders. Trump does deals. Bigly tremendous deals. Deals that haters couldn't negotiate to save their lives. He personally vanquished the deep state that threatens the very fiber of America. He did a deal on health care and another one on taxes. His enemies are all jealous and the only reason he hasn't outlawed the Democratic party and put their representatives in jail is because Ivanka told him not to. Ivanka is beautiful and smart and her husband Jared is almost as good of a businessman as Trump. Jared is doing the work of the entire State Department all by himself.

0,"Bob Lacher - Trump is clearly a problematic candidate for Republicans (or conservatives in general) to vote for. There is every evidence that he has more in common with the Democratic Party than with conservatives, although some progressive Republicans may not take issue with his platform. Personally, I think he's been installed by the Democrats and the reason this was such a high primary turnout year for the GOP and a low one for Democrats is that a lot of Democrats crossed over to assure a problematic candidate for the GOP against an extremely weak Democratic candidate. Whether Hillary or Bernie won the primaries would not have mattered. Americans generally reject socialism and Hillary is ... well, Hillary.  Of course, the solution to the Trump problem is not to vote for Hillary if you oppose her platform. The solution is to vote for someone else. Johnson is at 12% again. Let's get him into the debates and see what he says. This is a time when polls actually mean something.

The utter ironies of States like Kentucky regarding just healthcare make a rational mind stagger - one of, if not the the top, States benefiting from ACA uptake  and yet having the single most powerful anti ACA senator in Mitch McConnell is stunning.  And then there is the rest of the ruling regime not even attempting the basics of reigning in costs - no mention is made of simple steps to reduce drug costs, make insurance markets more viable nor choke off service needs at the roots with a basically more healthy population.

The category would also include any conflict, for instance, with North Korea, that carries a substantial risk of nuclear escalation. In part, because of Mr. Trump’s expressed hostility towards Iran and China, and his tendency to see all international relations in zero-sum terms, I estimate the five-year probability of a “moderate” war crisis to be high, at 60 per cent.

The upcoming NAFTA negotiations will be of high interest to important elements of the Trump support base and begin soon. 2. If the international trade policy of the Trump Administration is more than simply transactional machismo, then it is implicitly 18th-century Mercantilist with Canada and Mexico envisioned as economic hinterland to the US's metropolitan centre. 3. Canada may not run a trade surplus in manufactures but we do in certain industries (ex. softwood) and the US will cherrypick for decisive wins wherever there to be found.  In short, Canada better have its own list of unfair US trade practices with which to bargain and be cultivating trade allies and new markets.  Becoming a quasi-neocolonial backwater to the US is a fate to be resisted.

It worked for him in court more often than not, but I believe one's nationalism trumps ethnic determinism. For decades, nationalism has been decried by the left as anti-humanist, & therefore anti-American. That's one more irrational, liberal distortion of facts ... & human nature. I'm all for American Nationalism & putting American interests first.  We American citizens are not the nannies or insurers of the entire world population & we should actively resist all attempts to impose such """"duties"""" on our people.

I wasn't a Trump supporter, but I am very much a supporter of regional diversity and not allowing the majority to tyrannize the minority -- and, yes, exurban America is a minority that was beaten and crushed by the Obama administration and showed its fury by refusing to elect his chosen successor.

But please note that Donald Trump is NOT president """"because of the unequal distribution of electoral votes among the states"""" but rather because almost all states have chosen -- for partisan advantage -- to give ALL their electoral votes to the popular vote winner in their own state.  One could take this as indicating that the NATIONAL popular vote should instead be used, but an alternative is to recognize that this practice unconstitutionally deprives minority voters in each state of equal protection (i.e., equal treatment of their votes), an issue that was highlighted by the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore (2000).  A solution would be for all states to agree to assign their electoral votes proportionally to the popular vote in their own state. If this were done -- even with the small-state advantage built into the Electoral College -- Trump would still have lost (given the campaigns and votes as they were).

0,"He will never represent my views and for that I am extremely grateful. I would hate to think of the kind of person I would have to be to have Donald J Trump  represent my vies of others and the world. I prefer Jesus Christ. I only hope the republicans put country before party and vote to impeach him if necessary. His lack of ethics, morality, humility and his connections with Russia scare the hell out of me.  Not sure what I can't """"grasp"""" according to you. I see republicans and Trump repealing ACA and leaving millions without insurance, changing education fundamentally, destroying Medicare and Social Security as we know it. He is there to enrich himself and his wealthy friends, that is what he does and he has left plenty of evidence over the years  if one cares to see it.

0,"He was so concerned about those poor, innocent Syrian babies that he forgot about the US' recent Mosul strike that killed 200 civilians. Their bodies were burned and mutilated by the attack so we won't ever see images of those babies. The same people decrying the 'inhumane' chemical attack don't care about the babies burned by American bombs. Trump also forgot to prove that the chemical attack was actually conducted by Assad who was about to win the war and had no reason to spark international aggression. Why was it so important to strike Syria before an investigation? Does this distract from other issues? How does this effect the US economy? People need to stop thinking about this in a partisan way and consider this logically. We're being duped, again.

0,"It did make the news, but the news organizations pick and choose what to cover.  They gave Trump something like $1 billion in free publicity by talking about every little thing he did.  They completely ignored Sanders, they basically ignored anything about Hillary but the emails. So, like I said, it was in the news, but ultimately overshadowed by the news orgs obsession with covering every second of Trump's life.  It was 34 """"diplomats"""" or spies.  I don't disagree that the response was kinda weak, but am unsure what else could have been done.  Though pushing the press to cover it more, would have been a good start.

She beat him in New York (both their home states) by 1,732,973 votes.  She got over 60% of the votes in California (our most populous state, and the sixth largest economy in the world), Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and DC.  Trump got less than 40% of the votes in those locales and also in Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Washington, and here Oregon.  See http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/ for a method to change the disproportion that Mr. Quirk's letter notes.  They propose a compact of states pledging their electors to the winner of the popular vote.  So far, eleven states, with 165 electoral votes, have enacted this into law, to take effect when a majority of electors come from members of the compact.  The Electoral College is only one of a number of undemocratic institutions in our government.  See also gerrymandered districts, and the US Senate.

The 2000 election was decided by a handful of votes in Florida, where Jeb! was the prevailing puppet master. Arguing there was state-level corruption in a single Republican mainstay is light years different than arguing the election is rigged, before it happens.  Gore never said anything like that, but then again he won the popular vote, which is something that Trump will never experience. This race is over, he knows it, and he's already begun to whine.

I now realize you must be joking, or perhaps need a little help with the article:  """"A Florida Trump supporter sprayed mace at a Clinton supporter who she said got into her face and responded to the spray by knocking her to the ground, police said.""""  So the Trump supporter did the spraying, and the Clinton support did the """"knocking her to the ground"""" So the Trump supporter (mace-sprayer) was a woman. Clinton supporter was a man. Article goes on to identify them as Donna Tatlici and Tom Garrecht. Agreed?  Next, your quote (which you modified by adding party affiliations, incorrectly): """"Tatlici warned Garrecht, 58, she had pepper spray and would use it on him when he cursed “right into my face,” she told The Palm Beach Post. He didn’t back off, so she pepper-sprayed him, she said. Garrecht then slammed her to the ground and punched her, according to Tatlici.""""

Trump - unhappy with 4 dollars of Chinese stuff for 1 dollar of American stuff and a $360 billion annual trade deficit - is the driving force to create a level playing field between China and other countries.  But other nations (obviously not ours with Little Potato at the helm) are also seriously reexamining their one sided trade deals with China.  The most closely integrated country with China - Australia - is urgently reviewing its arrangements and concluded they should play by Chinese rules closing off entire sectors of their economy to foreign trade and applying stringent limitations on foreign access to the remaining sectors.  Australia will also put in place much tougher rules to prevent cash for access and limit the number of their politicians on the take from communist billionaires.  Germany is also now critically reviewing its arrangements with China.  Statues of daddy are not enoug

The Republican party is not successful in Hawaii, but has been very successful in the mainland.  The Democrats have lost over 1100 elected seats in the nation since Obama has become President.  And these continued tantrums will result in more losses 1n 2018. The Dems tout themselves as the party of the tolerant, but only if you agree with them.  Go back and read these comments.  Which side is more civil?  What will this election mean for Hawaii?

When the original Canada-US FTA came into force in 1989, Canada saw many branch plants  close as production shifted to factories in the US.

Governments are not so different than ie the stock market. When they get too out of balance a correction of sorts takes place. The US housing fiasco of 2008 is a good example. Corruption big time there, and who paid the price? Fast moving technology has changed the world in ways we never imagined. We never saw it coming. Kodak is a good example of that.

0,"When Trump was elected I knew he will start a war somewhere. But where? So many enemies, so many opportunities. We now know Trump have decided to start Korean War 2.  NK was barred by UN Security Council from making nuclear and other WMD weapons. But not anything else. Because any country has rights of self-defense and can make any weapon systems as long as its not nuclear or chemical/bio. So NK violated no international laws. It did not fire a shot to South. The thing about Trump is he does not care about laws or authorization. He will start Korean War 2 and that's that. He figures carriers, subs and missiles will do the trick. Winning the war will make him famous, unchallenged, outdo Truman and all presidents since. It will make him great.  So I say let Korean War 2 start. It will engulf the entire Korea peninsula, kill millions. Trump can watch the show in Florida sipping wine. If he wins he become the greatest president since WW2 in his mind. If he lose, well restart Cold War 2.

If he pulls out of the Paris Agreement on Climate  -- which would increase the world's average temperature by a miniscule amount over the next 100 years -- and the dire predictions of climate doom don't materialise (they have not for 20 years and counting), it will be a major triumph for common sense and democracy.

His lawyers and accountants were good enough to leverage the banks so he didn't totally go under years ago. Why has he still not released his tax returns? Because he's hiding something that will show that he is not as successful as he claims to be. He has almost completed projects over budget and some of them have gone bust. And you want to talk about his lying wife who claimed she had a degree in architecture and then plagiarized her speech from Michelle Obama? His wife is nothing more than a gold digger. By the way...Trump is only for himself and nothing else at all. He's for White America and Rich American and that's him. You'll see that more apparent as his term continues.

The only hope is that the nations come to the bargaining table and work out a mutually-beneficial agreement, as happened with Iran.  President Obama may not have taken military action, but rather, worked behind the scenes to prevent a war.  Trump's words do not constitute positive action, and in fact, just inflame the situation.

In the early days of this presidency, Steve Bannon was apparently the de facto president. Consider, for instance, the hideous inauguration address and Bannon's successful ploy in getting himself appointed to the National Security Council. Then, in the wake of the Flynn debacle and Bannon's removal from the NSC (at the behest, no doubt, of Gen. McMaster), Bannon's star seemed to recede as Jared/Ivanka assumed the role of de facto president. Now, as Jared's Russia problem percolates, Bannon seems to be resuming his place in Trump's head and in his ear. Is Trump """"mad"""" in the way King George was? I don't know.  But what is eminently clear is that he is the most incompetent, most corrupt and most unstable person ever to occupy the presidency. On any given day, we don't know who -- if anyone -- is really in charge.

Imagine where we buy up a bit of land, fence it in and then build some 600 housing to house CONgress families. Then require that the families be mixed. By that, I mean, that GOP and Dems MUST be mixed up and not segregated. This way, I would expect occasional block parties, etc, with kids and parents meeting each other and perhaps the CONgress critters will be talking. These guys used to mix regularly in the evening but no longer do.

0,"Thank you for this incredibly relevant post.  It is this vital point you raise (the passing of the NDAA of 2012) that consistently gets lost in this topic by Clarence Moriwaki, Tom Ikeda of Densho, and others.  Obama, with bipartisan and nearly unanimous support (including from then Congressman Jay Inslee), passed this law that allows the president on his say so alone... to have the military secretly arrest an American citizen or legal resident in America, without charge or trial, and secretly hold them in a black site prison anywhere in the world.... indefinitely.  No due process.  Yet Clarence, while quick to mention Trump and his fears, consistently praised Obama and Inslee (who he worked for as special assistant) with no detectable (that we can find) rebuke for what they did with the NDAA of 2012.  Obama even defended this unconstitutional power in court against the liberal plaintiffs Chris Hedges, Dr. Cornel West, Noam Chomsky, and Dan Ellsburg.  Why the silence?  Never again?

He never acknowledges the checks and balances put on the use of power by our Constitution.

That could happen, it should happen, as Trump breaks one promise after another, strips health insurance from millions of people, embarrasses and weakens the country, and continues building a government of the filthy rich, by the filthy rich, and most of all for the filthy rich. All of these things will happen; whether they will make any difference to his supporters remains to be seen.

Why? More recently he has been saying nice things about Theresa May and Brexit. The weakening of the EU is not in the best interests of either Europe or America but, again, it is what Putin wants.

1,"Donald Trump  has shown himself to be narcissistic, xenophobic, paranoid, vindictive, and thin-skinned. He takes credit for the work of others and blames others for his own failings. He lashes out at the press when they criticize him, and he demonizes judges who disagree with him. He's a president who doesn’t understand the higher purpose of his office, or that the intention of governing is to advance the common good. He's a juvenile ego surrounded by unethical and inept advisers and we can only hope the damage to the US and the world will be minimal.

0,"And so ends the American Empire. Asia is the most important place in the world and now the US brings nothing to the table.

The end will be a slow decay (though Trump will likely greatly accelerate it, as Bush did) but the writing is now on the wall. Coming back from this will be next to impossible.

At least we know what we're getting when we get them.  BTW, if the media would concentrate on the Clintons like they have Trump, the American public would be able to make a much more informed choice.

Which turns out it was anything but just to execute the planned coronation of Hillary.  The third point is this is now the second time democrats have grasp for the Russian straw to cover their azz.  Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden had a profile on the Ashley Madison dating website for extramarital affairs. He was caught having cheated on his wife.

That's more people killed than in hurricanes Harvey and Irma combined. It was like who cares? Not Trump.  No trip to California because Cali went bigly for HRC.  I am sometimes surprised there isn't a big push in California to secede. The talk of secession was coming from Texas pre Harvey, but post Harvey it's hunky dory to take billions in Fed money when it wasn't hunky dory after Super Storm Sandy for the North East.  It would be laughable to see how the red South dealt with the loss of the tax generating revenue of the 8th largest economy in the world. Given they are all tax money takers, I'm sure it would be devastating, but never acknowledged.

The US may do little as a result of his outburst but other nations may take this as grounds to justify expanding their arsenals.  Nuclear war has not happened since the first bombs fell over 70 years ago because the number of nuclear powers has been limited and the consequences unthinkable. Mutually assured destruction kept everything in check.  This will not be true over the next 70 years.

0,"Several times since the election, I've expressed my confidence that the Constitution is sturdy enough to survive the Trump presidency. In order for that to be true, the members of the other branches -- the judiciary and the Congress -- have to act with courage, integrity and independence. As you so aptly point out, the nation survived the Nixon presidency precisely because members of the president's party were loyal to the country and to their oaths of office, recognizing that the aspirations of parties and individuals had to be set aside for the good of the country. It is very difficult to see that courage and integrity among the Republicans today, with the few exceptions you mentioned. Ryan has proved to be especially disappointing. He simply has no backbone. Having said all of that, I'll add this: I think that congressional staffers from both parties are studying the impeachment process so as to be ready when they need it. Not to do so would be political malpractice.

The latter polls very accurately predicted Clinton's lead in the final popular vote total. Since Trump won each of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by 0.2% to 0.7%, it is clear that, without Comey's letter, Clinton would have won these three states (and possibly Florida) and would be President today.

Bad polling data in specific states & faulty presumptions re voter turn-out.  That is all.  You are incorrect.  There certainly were protests in 2008--easily proved.  They were not as widespread or popularly attended as those of the past weekend, but that's because Obama didn't run a negative, fact-free, anti-science, etc. campaign as did Trump.  Obama was not planning to defund Planned Parenthood or do away with a flawed yet important ACA.  The millions who marched on Sunday did not cause the destruction you claim--twice in a short post--they were peacedful and law abiding.  Some anarchists protested on the weekend (Fri/Sat/Sun) but they are not representative of the YUUGE coalition on Sunday.

There are many good reasons to be mistrustful of American intelligence agencies, and equally good reasons to be mistrustful of Trump & Putin and perhaps Assange.   But it is a trifle hard to accept that seventeen intelligence agencies, many led by conservative military types who would place more value on getting along with a new President than on not, have simply cooked this up.

Because whilst Trump is a narcissistic blowhard that does not know when to keep his own mouth shut, and is a reactionary moron, at least he is honest within his own thought process, however wrong it may be.  Hillary, upon the other hand, is a calculating, pandering, and sociopathic entity, whereas she cares for no other individual save herself, and shall say, or do anything, to promote her own self, no matter who is injured, or dies, as a result of said ambition.

After Trump embarrassed the Clinton and Obama media, the next thing they did was try to expand  so-called Russian Hacking to question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency as well as attempt to stop Trump at the Electoral College by the brainwashing theme that Clinton deserved to be President with an overwhelming majority of 2.8 million votes over Trump.  Today, Trump is doing what he promised to do in the election.And the Clinton/Obama media is at it again with its """"Muslim Ban"""" propaganda with manufactured protests.

0,"The law is not enforced by the judiciary but by the executive branch.  The judiciary interprets the law in accordance with the constitution.  The media has no role to constrain government.  Its role is to report - without fear OR FAVOUR  - on government activities so an informed citizenry can determine who is worthy of support in future elections.  The president is chief executive of the executive branch with responsibility to administer that branch NOT the entire country (like some all powerful but totally clueless PM with a majority government can.)    There is no chief legislator position but thanks for your attempted civics lesson.  45 presidents in 241 years yet NONE have been impeached and only 3 have come near the high bar of """"HIGH CRIMES and misdemeanors"""".  Trump is nowhere near this threshold.  Only the insane, gullible and historically challenged believe he is and only the cynical liberal troughers pretend to believe he is.  How disgraceful are the Beltway Bandits on this!

Personally, I am not willing to let you speak for all the people around the world or, for that matter, for the people of Canada. Segal is correct. The appearance of bigotry and mean-spiritedness cost Harperites the election. Moreover,  over the long term, demographics don't favour older, white, rural, uneducated males: the bed rock of the Conservative vote.

0,"Chairman Burr acted like a leader in his closing statement.  As much of a verbal handshake and hug as could be given.  Because, Comey's testimony came off credible, self-effacing (by his admission he wished he had been stronger and stood up directly to Trump), and pretty much non-partisan.  That's the way it should be.  The conversation is no longer about whether Trump acted badly and tried to influence the FBI investigation into Russia and Flynn.  The question is whether his doing so rose to the level of a convitable crime.  That is a significant shift.  The national discussion will now be about splitting hairs over what former US Attorneys think about  convictability for obstruction of justice.  I don't think anyone who is reasonable thinks Comey is lying, or at least not trying very hard to be thorough and honest.  Bottom line, it looks like the President is not being honest, and his people are supporting dishonesty.  How did we come to this?   We didn't learn from Nixon?

If Pyongyang keeps up the bluster, Beijing has a financial incentive to help out, since US trade sanctions would cripple them.

It could possibly be the basis for greater American unity, for a joining together of more of us in being careful with our fragile democracy being assaulted so grievously now.

The only benefit of the recent decision of the ninth circuit court regarding Trump, is the the nation is now aware of the fact that 86 percent of decisions of that circuit are overturned. So as taxpayers, we should demand that the ninth district should be either abolished or split into more manageable geographically centric districts. I, for one am appalled that federal workers, and that is what judges are,  are getting paid for being wrong 86 percent of the time. All taxpayers should share in that sentiment and tell their congressional representatives to abolish the 9th Circuit court of appeals.

The remaining space could have been used for more important news  about the other candidates' positions on matters that are important to Canadians.  As Canadians, we don't need news articles to tell us who to vote for and who not to vote for.  Give us the grass roots news objectively by relating only the facts.

There is minimal chance that this bill will pass, and it's just another failed bill in the long list of failed bills for the Trump administration. This was billed as the last chance for Trump to pass any significant bill, and it's clearly headed for the trash pile. It was also billed as the last chance for this administration and republicans to continue as a valid """"party"""" and it's a fail. The 2018 elections will now result in Democrat dominance in the senate and Congress, leading to impeachment of Trump, if he makes it that far. It's failed plan after failed plan for Trump and his klan, and the country (including republicans) have had enough.

0,"One of the more interesting, but least proven, ideas in history is that good results from good people allowed to do good things -- an idea not found everywhere in the scriptures, old or new, and one specifically challenged by the authors of Job, Qoheleth, and other protest authors of the Hebrew tradition. Plato certainly portrays the death of Socrates as a betrayal of the same idea by the good people of Athens. The Hebrew tradition explicitly recognizes that God can bring forth good from bad people, as in the case of Cyrus the Great, often considered a messianic figure. And the New Testament is replete with stories of good people who either did evil or whose good works were not met with tangible success. I'm no apologist for Mr. Trump, but I think the question whether any good can come from his administration is not easily answered in terms of Christian faith.

I don't think the Republican Party has the courage to fight Trump, they are too focused on the bones that he is tossing them in the way of stealing health care from the poor to give tax breaks to the rich. They seem to think they can just play with the devil and tame him to be a good partner. Perhaps those still alive in ten years will wake to find themselves in a Putinesque America, where words like democracy and human rights are used, but only as a smokescreen for the oligarchy.

Trump is just calling out laggards like Canada, and deservedly so. If Canada doesn't like the terms of NATO and can't spend the $$, then it will need to go its own way (Ha Ha).

Why would we give the US the comforting impression that we're dependent on them and afraid to annoy them?  Moore was invited by the Trudeau government to be a NAFTA adviser. I wondered earlier today what motivated his disloyal outburst--was it frustration over an internal debate, or was it an ambush of his colleagues for party advantage?  Harper just answered my question: Both Conservative attacks are entirely about scoring political points against the Liberals by helping the Trump government get its way against Canada.

Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Clinton have paid off women accusers in the past, and to me that taints them, but they'll say it was less costly. I like this case because it must be proven, even if by a lower means of proof in a civil trial versus a criminal trial, preponderance of the evidence versus beyond a reasonable doubt. There are people, both genders, who seek the rich and powerful for their personal gain as a deep pocket being the motivation for accusation. Also, with men it is much easier for them to be so trapped, which is why I admire Mr. Pence and his manner of carrying himself concerning women outside his marriage.

Obama said """"elections have consequences"""" and """"I won"""" against the members of congress and the senate from the other party --- and he paid for it in 2010 by the voters taking away their supermajority in the senate --- because it was not entertaining.  If Obama had figured out a way to say """"look, you guys screwed up the country, I'm going to fix it"""" and followed through and succeeded, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 would have seen the republicans wiped out.

He routinely calls people “stupid,” and “dummy.” One writer catalogued sixty-four occasions that he called someone “loser”, as of Feb., 2016. These were not off-line, backstage, overheard, not-to-be-repeated comments. They were publicly and intentionally tweeted, recorded, and presented.  Such insensitivities wouldn’t be acceptable even for a middle school student body election. But for the Oval Office? And to do so while brandishing a Bible and boasting of his Christian faith?

Over the past 48 hours, women have been assaulted for wearing the hijab, property has been defaced with swastikas, LGBT Americans have been threatened, and African Americans have experienced election result-specific harassment by fellow Americans touting the election of Donald Trump as the dawn of a new America, apparently one where they consider that the ugliest of racial and social animus to have the seal of presidential approval.""""

That power is reserved to Congress to amend or repeal its own acts.  Perhaps you are confusing a limited delegation with some express grants of discretion (such as issuance of waivers which is also limited not """"ultimate"""") as """"given ultimate power?""""

Your repeated reliance on this part of federal statute does nothing in regards to Trump's decree being found to violate the Constitution.

0,"Reminder: Clinton got the popular vote by millions of votes. So populism is not exactly the """"Zeitgeist"""".  And even if the Zeitgeist is against globalization, it is not owned by Trump; nor is it even populist, in the sense of politics which panders to popular beliefs, no matter how stupid.  Bernie Sanders achieved massive popularity by voicing concerns with globalization from a progressive point of view.  And even if the Zeitgeist is """"populist"""" in the dumb-and-proud sense, that doesn't mean Davos is not necessary.  And even if Davos is """"elitist"""" in the sense expressed by the trailer park crowd, then so what?  This type of writing smacks of celebrity style fluff.

0,"The federal U.S. Appeals Court refused to reinstate Donald Trump's travel ban.  Section 212(f) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 states: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”  Congress gave that power to U.S. presidents. In fact, one source says """"the past six presidents have all used the executive power to bar different classes of immigrants"""". That included some Muslims.  So does that decision by the 3 U.S. Appeals Court judges mean Section 212(f) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 is useless and meaningless?

0,"Given a lack of options, yes I probably will vote for Trump.  I find it interesting how repeated career politicians are walking away from Trump. They did the same thing to Reagan. I believe Republicans are controlled by the """"oil"""" money and other big money. They push their agenda. Dems are the same way. I don't think Fox is for Clinton, but I think Fox is for the republican establishment and the money that drives that establishment. I think Trump is seen as a threat to that establishment.  I know what Clinton brings. Higher taxes, increased debt, and more social spending. The same things that Obama brought us. Our country can't continue like it is. I know what McCain would bring us if he was in that seat. Same as Bush. I believe this country needs a REAL change. I personally liked Ben Carson, but that didn't pan out. I believe Trump is a clear outsider to the establishment and I think they are afraid of what he will do if he wins (both dem and rep).
"
0,"That would be the worst case scenario, but it's not completely out of the question.  Dislike him or hate him, Donald Trump is president today because he tapped into a deep well of dissatisfaction with Establishment politics in America. Disenfranchising his large pool of voters even more by impeaching their lawfully-elected president is bound to bring serious consequences.  Were it up to Establishment politicians on both sides of the US political divide, they'd probably love to dump Trump. He's not one of them. But were they to do so for anything less than the most clear-cut and egregious violation of the law on Trump's part, there will be big-time blowback.

Trump - Everybody, Hillary - Libya - Honduras , Obama the dronester in chief.  America is considered the worlds greatest bully, kids see what society accepts and they mimic. I believe bulling is far less in countries that are peaceful and do not make war. By that note, bulling in US schools will continue for a long time ahead. As long as US's never ending wars.  The public takedown of bully Ryan Lochte is a start. And that happened partly because of his actions in a foreign country, Brazil. That leads me to wonder what the bulling stats are in Brazil? Far less than the US is my best guesstimate.

Speaking only for myself, but betting that there are a lot of others like me, I simply can't be part of any movement that includes the Pat Buchanan type """"Populist Nationalist"""" set.  In 1965, William Buckley had the courage to make it clear that they were not welcome, in 2000, GWB, whatever his faults may be, told them to get lost, but now the Party is too weak, the takeover is complete, and our job going forward is to do the same thing with them, as the Brits have with UKIP, the French with FLN etc. allow them a voice, but coalesce as necessary to keep them out of power.

Case in point, her husband's crime bill, the one she vehemently supported as necessary against """"super predators"""", which only enhanced an already racist criminal justice system. It could be argued that without the Clintons, there would be no need for Black Lives Matter, because the Clintons escalated both the war on drugs and the militarization of domestic police forces to an unprecedented level; both of which routinely and disparately target minorities, Even more incredible is that HRC was caught  rigging an election, conspiring with foreign nationals in a pay to play system, lying to both the public and Congress, and yet...we just don't talk about these things?

But the Rich 1% pay most of the taxes in the first place -- 50% Pay Zero in Taxes. >>Ergo, that 'Tax Cuts' for the Rich' whine by democrats is a twist on the truth, not quite a lie, but close enough.

As Machiavelli said, if given a choice, it is better to be feared than loved. From Trump's point of view, he didn't quit a life of ease and luxury to babysit a bunch of gridlocked politicians.

The Constitution requires the president to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, as Trump is trying to do.  What Obama did is completely opposite.  His prosecutorial discretion to intentionally not enforce a duly enacted law violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, but his EO went much further -  he made his own immigration law to protect Dreamers from deportation.  The president may have wide discretion in enforcing laws, but he does not have the authority to authorize violations of the law nor can he nullify a law.  Obama clearly was wrong and I am confident the Supreme Court will so rule.

0,"No doubt that Trump is a bull in a Twitter shop. Who knows what his presidency will bring. What's more fun and interesting right now is watching the folks that don't like Trump. Especially the SJWs , globalists and celebrity """"I'll leave the USA if he gets elected"""" luvvies. The same types that were anti-Brexit. Their anger is palpable. Despite the fact that both results were  fair and square according to the rules they believe they were robbed. The US electoral system that has served the nation for so many generations is apparently now """"broken"""".  One example. Dem Rep John Lewis who has been re-christened Civil Rights Icon John Lewis spouts a conspiracy theory that Trump's 'russian-assisted' election isn't legitimate. Trump blasts him for the failures of many of America'r inner cities - which are majority Black and mostly run by Democrats. That fact that Lewis marched in Alabama in the '60s has nothing to do with what Trump was talking about.

Because it seems as if you Constitution-deniers don't quite understand how the system works and are unwilling to accept that a Republic president won the election and that Hillary lost completely on her own, right about the time she called 40% of the country's voters """"deplorable"""" idiots who she had no intention of working with.  You understand, right? THAT'S what the voters rejected. THAT'S why she lost. It wasn't love of Trump that did it. It wasn't that the Russians released emails that showed she hadn't just misspoken, but that this was really truly her attitude (that did help). It was that Hillary, knowing those emails were out in the public, insulted half the country and thought she could get away with it.  Until you wrap your minds around that your side will continue to lose elections.

The politicians said, """"If we change our lifestyle the terrorists win"""". But then they went ahead and created more militarization, more police, more security state, more surveillance state, took in more refugees, increased immigration, placed Islam and other religions at the top of daily public discourse. Soon freedom of speech was under attack. Signs are everywhere warning people to watch their language. Folks converse less than ever.

0,"Trump has made the right decision.  People with mental disorders, of which there are many, are routinely disqualified for military service.  Transgenders suffer from “gender dysphoria,” formerly known as “gender identity disorder,” which is classified as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, so don’t blame me.  The typical conditions suffered by people with gender dysphoria are stress, anxiety and depression, each being a disqualifier for enlisting or commissioning in military services.  Moreover, when such conditions are acquired by military personnel while on active duty, they are normally discharged for being unfit.   It makes no sense to grant an exception to military mental standards to allow a class of people to join the military when people who contract the same mental disorders while on active duty are being discharged as unfit.

Oh, no.  Yes, of course there will always be a cohort of people who think we need massive government intervention to separate the good people from the bad people, and to ensure that only the former can voluntarily invest their own money in real estate.  Then, separately, the same people will complain that too little is being invested in real estate, so some other cohort of bad people must be taxed so that the government can buy and build housing, and bestow it upon the good people at below market rates.  But really, has a half century of utter failure of government intervention in housing markets, in many countries, taught us nothing?  Typically, ideology trumps sense.

I also thought it wrong to mock Mrs Clinton's clothing during the campaign. But you are defending criticism of this FLOTUS and misrepresenting where she wore what for good measure. You must be proud.

This generations of politician's are still living off the public feed bag as well as collecting large sums of money from their donors so their opinion's are often not their own and change at the dollar tossed their way. Trump is a glaring example of """"first I was for it and now I am against it' depending on what they are doing at the time to attract more money or votes. Trump the worst?

0,"@kuroiwaj:  The Trump Organization is too smart to invest in rail in a city the size of Honolulu because they know there's not enough money being paid in the construction portion of it and City and State regulations make projects like this impossible to come in on time and under budget since these projects require that workers on the project be paid significantly more (usualy double or more than that depending on the skill required) than what the private sector would pay for the same amount and types of work (i.e. Prevailing Wage).  A good example is there's a stair case being built on the UH Manoa campus between Johnson Hall and Gateway House dorms and it was supposed to be finished by June 30.  It was crossed out and the new tentative date for it's completion is supposedly today (July 3).  Who wants to bet that it won't be finished today?

0,"NAFTA has been a disaster for Canada and has not helped the development of Canadian industry. The country is still mainly getting its wealth from selling raw resources to the US and then using these profits to support an over-large civil service and welfare programmes.  We should use Trump as an opportunity to use trade to develop the country and not just as a way to make it easier for resource owners to sell tariff-free into the US. Canada should identify high-value sectors that will create long-term employment and use trade agreements to help grow these sectors. As an example, mandate technology companies to partner with Canadians or to locate in tech hub areas (Waterloo etc.).

As the noose tightened for Nixon, you could see the administration drawing the """"wagons into a circle"""". I think the same is likely to happen to Trump.  As for evidence associated with the Uranium discussion? I'm not certain any laws were broken, are you? My understanding is it was more an ethical breach where it would be a conflict of interest for a sitting SOS to negotiate directly or indirectly such a deal with a foreign power. Trump has been guilty of conflicts of interest every day since he assumed office.  While I welcome transparency, Clinton's ethical violations pale in comparison to election meddling as committed by Nixon + the possible collusion of the Trump campaign with the Russians.

Maybe Seth Rich really was the disgruntled DNC employee that was upset over cheating in the primary pushing Bernie aside.  Wikileaks seemed to hint that he was their source.  That also fits the theory that Russia was not involved.  We see political operatives working for the intel industry.  Maybe they provided bogus reports on the hacking because Trump spoke of them negatively during the campaign.  Revenge is a nasty business.

Report: RNC Employees Asked To Save All 2016 Campaign Documents  The RNC’s counsel asked employees to not delete or modify any documents, records or other materials related to the election from computers, tablets, cellphones, emails or any other storage device and said there would be “serious consequences” for anyone who failed to comply.  This is not the first time an organization with ties to President Donald Trump has taken such precautionary measures in relation to the probe into Russia meddling in the 2016 election. Last month, members of the President’s transition team were ordered to save all documents related to Russia and Ukraine.  The RNC worked with the Trump campaign during the election and the group’s former chairman, Reince Priebus, served as Trump’s White House chief of staff, until he was ousted last week.  Mueller is making the colluders very nervous in light of Congress' attitude towards treasonous ties between Putin and Trump.

0,"So what if HiLIARy received 1 million more votes.  Trump received the most popular votes in 30 states.  Your flawed mob rule logic would elect a president based on the fact that one state, aka California cast one million more votes favoring HiLIARy.  California is NOT a true reflection of what the rest of the nation wants.  It's no secret Progressive Democratic Socialists want mob rule.  Since slavery is no longer an issue and everyone, regardless of race or gender can vote, your point is no longer relevant.  Mob rule is what you have in Washington State which is controlled by a small number of counties.  Trump won 30 out of 39 counties.  Mob rule was considered by our Founding Fathers and quickly rejected.  On a national scale a mob rule system would be controlled by a small number of states and would no longer represent the nation as a whole.  Your party lost and now you want to gerrymander the election process to tip the scales in your favor.

0,"No one denies the importance of immigration to the economy.  But equally important is a population that respects the laws of the nation.  Current immigration laws allow for as many immigrants as we desire to keep the population expanding and the economy growing.  They also help assure that the people coming here actually contribute to the economy (with exceptions for refuges) and aren't criminals.  Perception is everything; if Trump continues to rail against illegal aliens, it will have the desired effect of discouraging more illegals from coming, encouraging those here illegally to self-deport and get back in line, and increase public support for enforcement measures to keep would-be illegal aliens out.

The wealthy, purveyors of conservatism and owners of the Republican Party, the former being half-baked excuses for greed and corruption while the latter is the tool of implementing an agenda of greed and corruption, create turmoil while attempting a comic high wire act of gulling voters into voluntarily, even enthusiastically, accepting corporate oligarchy and serfdom.

I think many of her policies would have been bad, but at least she had a direction she wanted to go.  Trump on the other hand seems to be absolutely directionless with the exception of """"erase any and all things Obama did"""".  That really isn't a policy that is good for the future of the country.

And there are the lightly veiled threats by disgruntled puppets of Trumplethinskin who talk coup, revolution and other nonsense.

If Canada negotiates this alone Canada will do 100% better on everything. As said,  Canada should be able to negotiate a better deal now. The US needs Canadian Oil, more Canadian Hydro Electrical power, needs more natural gas, needs more fresh water. Canada needs to use all these products to create better deals for all trade. Think about this """" Trump is yelling hurry up because people have told him this will work worse for the USA.

0,"Walker said he also invited Trump to come to Alaska this summer, though there's no telling if a presidential visit is likely, I hope President Trump comes and sees how bad Alaska's oil and gas lands are managed by the Governor and the DNR!  Not one exploration well is being drilled today anywhere in Alaska because the DNR DOG runs off smaller competitors and keep Alaskans out of the oil wealth!
"
0,"Yes, alarmists need to chill. The sky is not about to fall  - even if Trump were to make good on today's renewed threat to kill NAFTA.  First, Trump is very likely bluffing - in the silly belief his threat is likely to cow Canada into knuckling under.  Secondly, it is doubtful Trump has the legal authority to haul the U.S. out of NAFTA without Congressional approval. (This is presently being argued but the no argument is quite compelling.)  Thirdly, there are powerful interests in the U.S. that would see to it that congressmen would say 'nyet' to Trump.  In the meantime, Herman is right: Canada should prepare for life without NAFTA. Not only is it the prudent thing to do given Trump's threats, but preparing ourselves for that eventually is probably the best preemptive of it ever happening.  My own guess is NAFTA will outlive Trump's stint in the White House.

Sorry to have to say this, but If it werent for those two cops today there several Republicans would have been murdered.  That sets the stage, and now this is suddenly very real, and was predictable.  The left has lost their minds and they are calling for violence and they are doing it.  This is just the beginning.  Trump has been a nice guy until now...but the sleeper has awoken!  The American People are now very awake, and we will see where this leads.

As long as there is an """"us"""" and a """"them"""", there will never be a true reconciliation between the two sides. A divided America is doomed to fail both at home and overseas, and this is one of the reasons why Americans need a POTUS that does its best to unite rather than divide them. Clearly, someone with Donald Trump's ideas and modus operandi is not the best suited person for this task. I think this video reflects what's going on now in the US.

0,"I concur that Trump isn't an aberration within the GOP; quite the contrary, he's a manifestation, if not culmination, of what Republicans have espoused the past 35 years. Nevertheless, how is Hillary a significant departure from this? It must cause the GOP establishment unremitting heartburn that it's ideal candidate is running for the Democrats this year.  Not only is this US presidential election a choice between bad and worse, but signifies a conspiracy against hope. One can only hope that America is hitting rock bottom with this, given that a victory of either candidate WONT represent an unqualified endorsement. Indeed, it seems the sole rationale for voting for Hillary is to prevent a Trump victory, while the opposite also applies. I'm afraid that next week is merely a prelude to a festival of animus and chaos down south.

Or US citizen living in Asia? Making yourself feel good about being a kick butt American by talking tough is the type of macho garbage that makes sense if actual, unprovoked threats are occurring. But, Trump is provoking and propogating those threats. To what end?  WW3? The international compact has been, til now, NK existing in its adversarial posture, to recognize China's concern over its northern border, and to allow balance of adversarial interests in East Asia. Almost 60 years of relative peace has ensued. Within 7 months, accelerated over the past month and definitely the past 2 days, Trump has managed to completely destablize East Asia. Why?  To be macho?  Why?  What's the use? There was a military standoff at the Korean DMZ.  Nukes don't change that.  China doesn't want proliferation there.  Ever.

Comey served under incredibly difficult circumstances over the past year and (a) oversaw the FBI investigation regarding Clinton credibly but made a serious ‘small c’ mistake in the timing and manner by which he informed Congress when new info arose late in the election campaign, (b) that mistake warranted his resignation which was not tendered, (c) he was also overseeing the FBI Russian interference investigation credibly and deserved protection from interference in so doing, (d) there are serious & legitimate concerns that Trump fired Comey to thwart further FBI investigation of Trump campaign team’s complicity in the Russian interference, and (e) if further inquiry confirms that Comey’s firing occurred to thwart FBI investigations, then this is an impeachable offence.  2. Thus, the US is truly in a constitutional crisis, and  3. This is not only some media event for our distraction.

1,"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—President Obama is vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard when he should be hard at work running isis, Donald Trump charged on Thursday.  In an interview with Fox News, the Republican Presidential nominee said that Obama’s preference for golfing in favor of the demanding day-to-day work of running a terrorist organization shows “what a disaster he has been” at the helm of the Islamic State.  “Frankly, he doesn’t deserve to call himself the founder of isis,” Trump told Fox’s Sean Hannity. “He is a disgrace.”

0,"Moe Thomas, this surprises you?  The media undermines Trump at every opportunity.  It has nothing to do with """"the courage of their convictions"""".  They hate him and will always pick an unflattering pic.  Anyway, if you are a Trump supporter, than you should be delighted about it.  This was Trump's plan all along.  He declared war on the media and labelled them the """"enemies of the American people"""", so the media went to war.  Trump thinks he will prevail, the media disagrees.  Does this not make sense to anyone?  Every demagogue needs a boogieman or two.  For Trump it's the media and brown people.

0,"Single-payer healthcare in California? The annual cost was: $400 billion. Of that, $200 billion would come from existing federal, state and local funding for healthcare. The remaining $200 billion would have to be raised from higher taxes. The plan of universal healthcare activists is to convince President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress to transfer all the Medi-Cal billions to help leftist California finance a single-payer system, something they’d fear and deride as socialized medicine. The committee analysis assumed a 15% payroll tax on income. This in a state that already suffers from the highest income tax rates in the nation. But if all this happened, there’d still be between $50 billion and $100 billion in new money needed to fund a single-payer healthcare system. There’d be no premiums, co-pays or deductibles — and therefore no self controls. So who knows how steep new medical costs would climb?  By George SkeltonContact Reporter Capitol Journal California

However, because Trump and his supporters won the election, every mistake and mis-step the new administration makes must be accepted by the country and the world, no matter if it's ethically/morally right or wrong or factually correct or incorrect, simply because Trump and his supporters are the winners of the election?

Hillary can never be allowed to be president.  This is not a Trump endorsement- but a choice between two really bad candidates.  Not that this really matters. Our votes do not count.

That is the role of the DOJ to make that determination and if possible crimes may have ben committed in the process. As for Benghazi we may never know the truth but the evidence at this time speaks highly of dereliction of duty on Hillary's part by not addressing the fact the an American consulate was being attacked and by her not taking the necessary steps to at least try to protect American lives. As for Trump. I do not like him either. But in all fairness one candidate should not have everything they do and say scrutinized while the other candidate does not get the same type of treatment.

Why would Russia only start hacking in 2016 but not 6 months earlier in 2016? Trudeau is a well known friend of Russia and had some glowing words for the brutal military dictatorship of Cuba and China. How come there's no RCMP investigation into Russia helping Trudeau win?

Because you can stand back, watch and listen to Trump who contradicts himself daily if not in the same sentence, and correctly conclude he is a vulgar, lying, narcissistic nut job!

The original report came from 'Heat Street' citing anonymous source which Trump seems to hate.  New York Times reported that they could not confirm this Heat Street article claim.  Even it is true, it is only talking about investigation possible money connections from two Russian banks to the Trump campaign, nothing about 'wiretapping' phone.

There are boundaries of appropriate presidential conduct, and Trump has crossed them early and often. Presidents Bush and Obama are among our nation's senior statesmen and it is not only appropriate but necessary that they speak out when this occurs.
"
0,"The basis of the DACA executive order was the president using what he cited as """"prosecutorial discretion."""" This meant that the government would put very low priority on what were described as """"Childhood Arrivals"""". This prosecutorial discretion was DACA policy, but only by executive order. There is no part of the Constitution that says that a President can do something beyond his executive powers because Congress will not act. A challenge was made in federal court in Texas and the EO was found unconstitutional because it went beyond executive powers and altered the immigration statutes by creating an entire class of immigrants entitled to benefits such as work permits. I think Trump sees this as a chance to pressure Congress into coming up with a deal that can trade the DACA program with increased funding for immigration enforcement (including for visa overstayers), as well as important parts of the RAISE act.

I note that one of the latest ones, the bombing in Lahore, barely rates a mention in the press. Presumably because a) it's either so commonplace it isn't considered newsworthy or b) it doesn't fit with the liberal narrative. 13 dead, 60 wounded, ho hum, just another day.  The sheer scale of the horrific acts committed in the name of Allah makes a mockery of attempts to compare to any other religion or movement. Here's just 2017, so far.  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=2017  Notwithstanding that, the post-election violence referred to by sheeperst is that perpetrated by the anti-Trump demonstrators, which has been demonstrably proven. Nothing to do with the Islamic extremists.

Here are the quotes:  “It’s like it’s from hell, it’s a terrible group of people,” Trump said in an interview with FOX News’ Neil Cavuto on Aug. 19, 1998.  Asked by Cavuto if Clinton’s image as a “quasi-sex symbol” stood to somehow benefit from the alleged extramarital relations, Trump took issue with the characterization.  “I don’t necessarily agree with his victims, his victims are terrible,” Trump said. “He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.”  “The whole group, Paula Jones, Lewinsky, it’s just a really unattractive group. I’m not just talking about physical,” he said.  “Would it be any different if it were a supermodel crowd?” Cavuto then asked.  “I think at least it would be more pleasant to watch,” Trump replied.

0,"Mr. Trump has made it clear from his statements that everything he does is designed to put America first, which means that other countries should lose to America, and his business history appears to be one of winning in a way that makes the other parties to his deals lose. He's not known to be the kind of businessman whose business deals make money for everyone involved, only for himself, and his comments since becoming President suggest that he will continue on that path. Most trade deals assume a benefit to both parties, while Trump seeks benefits only to America: benefits to other countries mean that America didn't get the best deal possible. If so, then Canada can never hope for a """"fair deal"""", since Trump's goal is to make America the winner in this case while Canada will be the loser. Lowering corporate taxes, for example, won't allow us to gain a trade advantage: Mr. Trump will simply lower his taxes to mitigate any gain Canada hoped to achieve, and so on until we submit.

Economic theory is mainstream and basic math-- you need not just employment, but growth in wages and consumption to get GDP growth. We have employed a lot of people, but hiring will level off or slow without more investment-- to create need for more hiring, and that means higher wages for those we hire and more consumption to attract more investment.

It would have been a routine operation for the KGB or FSB, and they would have been negligent if they hadn't tried.

You, like many other people across the globe, bought into his branding, not his ability to actually 'Make America Great Again'.  I did not vote for HRC, not because I thought she was incapable of being president, but because I am sick of this country being run by political dynasties like the Kennedy's, the Bush's, and the Clinton's.

1,"When a terrorist who is Muslim screams """"Allahu akbar"""" and commits his violence in the name of Islam, the lefties tell us the terrorist does not really represent Muslims and we must not assume that all Muslims are nasty.  Now here in this letter we have someone filled with hate claiming to represent Trump.  And Fukumoto then extends that to blame all Republicans.  So come on lefties, apply your same logic to this nutcase.  The fact that some idiot invokes the name of Trump does not mean all Trumpers are like this jerk, and certainly does not mean Republicans are like that.

What you're getting here is civil blowback for a bad decision.  Your 'joke' only really impressed a small subset of Liberals, while managing to offend just about everyone else. From the conservative that you (correctly) guessed would hate this 'joke', through the liberals you are (incorrectly) surprised are reacting with disdain at your 'joke', through moderates of all stripes who you didn't even bank on, your 'joke' has angered a large number of people, and they've made it clear that your presence in any piece of media will result in them changing the channel. It's now just business at this point, and your career is over as a business decision.  In your new career, may I suggest you engage the brain to mouth filter.

1,"Sen. Murkowski who supports abortion, and same sex marriage thinks she has the high ground to not support Trump.....What a hypocrite.  Does she support boys using girls bathroom and locker rooms also. The main reason Murkowski runs on the Republican ticket is it enhances her chances to get re-elected. She isn't honest enough to run on the Democratic ticket.  Her voting record is proof that she is fiscally irresponsible.  She isn't intelligent enough to realize what is at stake if Trump loses this election.  Four more years of extensive corruption throughout the Federal government.

0,"Glad to hear it, Douglas, but Gary is spreading fear of the right when the evidence is that the left has created the most ideologically extreme people who act on their ideals violently. Denials and raising money after the fact does not replace moderating campaign rhetoric in order to not encourage these individuals in the first place. And saying Clinton does not encourage it like Trump does is belied by the vile commercials her campaign and PACs run (in the swing states mostly), and the extreme lies they feed to the press to inspire """"opinion"""" columns. Trump's campaign is not doing this. So don't break your arm patting yourself on the back on this one.

The fact that he became the President of the USA is more a testimony to the anger and stupidity of his core supporters. Let's not forget, the more well educated voters rejected him.  His success is stupendous. He bankrupted his companies, stiffed his contractors, and started with a large inheritance. There are plenty of successful businessmen like that in the Third World too.

0,"The Americans wanted 'free trade' with Canada to secure a future oil supply. Previously, there were strict limitations on how much oil and gas was allowed to be shipped abroad. Exporters were required to prove we retained a twenty year supply before being allowed to export the extra. Now that our petroleum industry is fully integrated into a 'North American' market and the USA has discovered 'new' oil and gas reserves, they don't need us. The same holds true for Mexico. The Trump administration is 'welching' on a deal they made long ago with a close ally. Why would North Korea trust their security to American assurances?

"
0,"See a lot of posts that have it right. North Korea cannot be forced to give up its nuclear arms though military action. It takes China squeezing North Korea economically since North Korea is not a trading partner with the US. For that reason, Trump is being very nice to China. He said he will not designate China a currency manipulator and he went further to say that China was not manipulating its currency to devalue it. And he is taking a much more diplomatic approach to trade issues. By the way, the word is that North Korea is planning a nuclear test for Saturday.

But it looks more and more that Trump rushed in without gathering all the info and consulting Congress.  He didn't even consider that he'd be helping ISIS. He's no doubt aware of what we learned in political science 101, that leaders enjoy increased support and approval ratings when engaged in war.  Trump knows, """"it's all about marketing.""""

To my mind, the media ought to begin to comment on his policy initiatives or the lack thereof, on the impact of these initiatives, dealing with pressing questions such as """"does this help his constituents?"""". Trump being Trump, it can safely be predicted that anything he manages to get passed will be damaging to his constituents. At some point, they might begin to absorb that message.

0,"That has nothing to do with this argument.  I am not suggesting that the military has to change its requirements for performance in any position, let alone combat positions, to accommodate people of varying abilities.

I've said this before : there will be a war as long Trump is president. The enemy will be a country that America can defeat easily and quickly. I hope I'm wrong.

If they had brought it out DURING the election it could have had a devastating effect. .

Because Donald is going to take away their gravy train and ruin all their plans for global economic and military hegemony.

We've worked really hard since the end of WWII to achieve the peaceful world that we've enjoyed the last 25 years.  Has there still be war and mass genocide?  Yes.

Why did you not instead choose an article that simply addressed item number two, the dark side of Antifa?  Any thinking Canadian can predict the result of your chosen piece. The vast majority of Canadians cannot stand Trump, and so the writer's sympathetic praise of Trump will turn them off to all else he wrote.  Was that the intention?

0,"Let me tell you my take on why Hillary lost. Sit down and put on a seat belt:  Hillary Clinton lost because she tried to buy the election while offering no solution to anything of importance.  After her lost to Obama and ended up with millions in debt, Hillary decided to fix it. As soon as she was named Sec. of State and cannot go and raise money, she installed her own email server so that she can still run the Clinton Foundation from it. She can hide her international work for money, power and Neo-Con agenda from Obama. This work continue after she left the State Dept. She proceeded to raise money from speeches, such as $400k from a 30 min. Goldman Sachs speech. $150 million went to her pocket. This is her fund to buy the presidential election. She was so intense in money she forgot there are problems in the country. She had no comprehension on America's real problems, no idea on fixing anything. Why let them 'eat cake'.  Trump is right. Hillary is corrupted, unfit.

It may well be therefore that support for Trump and the GOP will not fall over the next 12 or so months as fast as we all assume.  However, the cumulative impact whatever changes the GOP agrees, in the end, to make to health care access, the failures in their economic and fiscal initiatives and the general chaos and meanspiritedness  of their term in control will probably catch up to them by the 2018 midterm elections and could well be quite dramatic (and negative) for the GOP by that time.

Radical islamist extremists, Russia, China, North Korea, Central and South America, even NATO allies who have a dim view of A Trump led US.  All waiting for the US to become unstable internally. Look at the pictures.  people of color + whites of  conscience vs. yahoos wearing camouflage, wearing Nazi helmets, and waving the flag.  A Microcosm of US problems internationally under Trump. So, in a time of the biggest crisis possible.  US out in the open n the brink of NUCLEAR war implicating large and critical regional instability, and worldwide participation, White Naitonalists try to make their move.  That's just how stupid (and desperate and unpatriotic) they actually are. Trump is responsible for this.  A red line has truly been crossed.

1,"Trump is a delusional, dangerously unqualified, unpredictable  and pathological liar with at least one unmistakable personality disorder.  Normally, someone like this would be in treatment, or ideally, relegated to a position of reduced responsibility.  Trump simply isn't capable of separating fact from fantasy. As such, I wouldn't want to be Trudeau tomorrow.
"
0,"It's disingenuous to say the least, even downright silly, for Trump's fans to claim there is no evidence against him when the real investigation is just beginning -- or do they always make their conclusions about issues before the facts are revealed. In any case, there will never be enough evidence for them, they will always demand more and more. It's one of their usual tactics, to stall for time, to obfuscate and divert, regularly used to deny realities that leave them vexed. They use the same tactics in their losing battle to deny climate change. They will never concede to their bogus hero's critics, not only on the left but even on the right, even the ones in his own party. Leave the Trumpers to their willful blindness.

0,"Had it not been for the Bush tax cuts, we would have still had a balanced budget and no crash in 2008, which happened because those tax cuts had nowhere to go than funding mortgage backed securities. Indeed, Obama's debt was lower and his economic performance higher than either McCain or Romney would have done. As it is, unless the budget is balanced and no interest is rolled over, the debt will always double in 8 years. At least Trump won't get that long and his tax bill won't pass. We are currently working under Obama tax and spending policies. May that contiue. Trump won't get the credit. With Manafort singing, he may not last the year.
"
0,"I disagree. Kim is very westernize and probably understands the need for a negotiated settlement.  And he seems to want to negotiate directly with the US. President Jimmy Carter was the only person who has successfully avoided hostilities by negotiating directly with Kim's grandfather - well idolized as the savior of Korea from the Japanese. Perhaps the same can be done between Trump and Kim?  I don't think it's very smart for the US to insist that Japan be part of multi-party negotiations with North Korea. Hatred of Japanese war crimes has not died down in Korea. The Japanese still need to redeem themselves and Abe is in no hurry to do so. And the Chinese don't want to send food down to the North Koreans by rail because the North Koreans commandeered the rail cars for their steel as well. Rail cars were never returned to the Chinese. Nobody is admitting to stealing the cars. The US should be willing to send food and other humanitarian Aid from the south in direct negotiations.

0,"For months I, on this site, have stated that Mr. Trump evidences the characteristics of a sociopath. Here's a common definition (from Wikipedia): """"A sociopath can be defined as a person who has Antisocial Personality Disorder. This disorder is characterized by a disregard for the feelings of others, a lack of remorse or shame, manipulative behavior, unchecked egocentricity, and the ability to lie in order to achieve one's goals."""" It's truly disturbing to me that we have a President-elect who so perfectly meets this description.  Before you condemn me for making such an uncivil, rash statement, please study Mr. Trump's history; his personal history, his business history and his political history; read his comments, listen to his interviews, watch the videos of the primary debates, watch the videos of the Presidential debates, read his """"tweets"""" since his election...then, look again at the definition of sociopath and decide if my comment is rash and uncivil or, sadly, accurate.

It seems inevitable that the Trump regime will impose some forms of a border tax.  Canada and Mexico should already begin co-ordinating their retaliatory tariffs on US exports to Canada/Mexico.  I think that we are headed for rough times.  I hope that Canada, Mexico, and other countries finally realize that any agreements signed with the United States aren't worth the paper they're printed on.

0,"Interesting to see how and whether these numbers correlate with our own mini-Trump era from 2006 to 2015. In fairness, Harper was nothing close to this clumsy, incoherent, offensive, ethically challenged 'leader of the free-world'. But they shared some basic instincts regarding the relationship between leaders and the societies they were elected to serve. In substance if not degree, they each believe they are above the law and exempt from constitutional constraint. Electoral rules, democratic precedent, watchdog agencies, and other branches of government (particularly supreme courts) are viewed as enemies of the state. One motivated by ideology; the other by avarice.  Our dalliance with autocratic rule never plumbed the depths of the abyss now enveloping America - in part because Harper was no Trump and in part because it would never have been tolerated by Canadians and Canadian institutions. It remains to be seen whether and for how long it will be tolerated in the United States.

Iran is no human rights paradise, but President Rouhani - recently re-elected with an overwhelming majority - is slowly but steadily moving the country towards a democratic secular condition, though with great resistance from the conservative institutions of the Supreme Leader (Khamenei), the Guardian Council and the Revolutionary Guard.  No such progress is seen in Saudi Arabia.  So why would Donald Trump double down on support for Saudi Arabia and crank up the anti-Iran rhetoric?  Rouhani should be encouraged, not demonized.  Now is the time for the west to reach out to Iran and seek to influence its institutions in positive ways, not give them the back of the hand.  The hypocrisy of the West's relationship with the Saudi regime is apparent and, as Iran becomes more progressive while the Sauds remain repressive, our relationship with the Sauds becomes ethically untenable.  .

You are correct, he is mean spirited.

This was done through a dizzying array of shell companies, so that the most that can be said with certainty now is that the money “paying” for it was originally loaned out to the shell layers by VTB (the government’s official bank), even though it’s highly unclear who, if anyone, would be paying that loan back; and the recipients have been traced as far as some Cayman Islands shell companies.  Why is this interesting? Because the much-maligned Steele Dossier (the one with the golden showers in it) included the statement that Putin had offered Trump 19% of Rosneft if he became president and removed sanctions.>>  https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.ewhypt3yf

The barriers were built starting in 1994 as part of several larger """"Operations"""".

More recently:  In 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush signed the """"Secure Fence Act of 2006"""" which increased the amount of fences, barriers, and security cameras along the Mexican border.  President Bush said: “This bill will help protect the American people. This bill will make our borders more secure."""" ------ Trump is not creating anything new, just updating what is there already.

0,"Roy,  All of these examples are of isolated reactions to rude, loud and obnoxious protestors at Trump Rallies.  In other words, the baiters succeeded in inciting a violent reaction, as many of them were paid to do.  Now, in the spirit of honesty, give us an example of where violent protesters showed up at a Democratic function to pick fights, block participation and damage property.  We know there are thousands of examples from cities across the USA where liberal protestors resorted to violence.  There was more violence and destruction just yesterday in Washington DC, than all the conservative protestors in the entire Country during the election cycle.  I am not religious, but a quote from the Bible is very apropos:  """"By their fruits ye shall know them"""" - Matt 7:20

Yes, Trump used the words “military operation” when referring to the administration’s enforcement of immigration laws, but it is not now and will not become a military operation.  Trump used the words figuratively or metaphorically to mean the administration’s immigration law enforcement operation was well planned and executed with military-like precision.  Nevertheless, I expect Klastri and his followers to take Trump’s words literally and make Trump’s immigration law enforcement into a Constitutional crisis of some kind.

0,"I don't think the scenario I laid out has any chance in the real world. The only reason it's even remotely plausible is this: Donald Trump doesn't know anything about healthcare; he doesn't care about it; he has nothing invested in it. What he does care about is """"winning"""" -- which is not about ideology but about humiliating his opponents. Republicans have no respect for him. He's a useful idiot; they pander to him in the hope that he'll sign what they give him. If he's not useful to them, he's just an idiot and they'll bail on them. It would be easy for Trump to flip on the Republicans and, on healthcare at least, become a useful idiot for the Democrats and progressives. His motive would be simple: to screw those he believes screwed him. Bernie Sanders keeps reminding Americans that universal healthcare is the norm in the rest of the developed world; that we Americans are outliers on this issue. There is massive misinformation here about how healthcare works in the rest of the world.

The anecdotes, both of which Mr. Trump told over the last week, were similar in that they appeared to be efforts to showcase broad support for the president when his White House has been mired in turmoil.

This is total, all-out war, and anything goes.   Do you honestly think that this race will be civil, or discuss any real subjects or issues?    This is going to be the most dirty, unscrupulous, and unethical Presidential race in history.   Democrats need to respond to Trump's fire with their own fire.  That was the big mistake other Republicans made in battling Trump: they were way too civil with him.   Cruz was the only exception, and look at how much better he did compared to the other Republican candidates.  People need to go all out in attacking Trump on a personal basis.  Anything is fair in love or war.   And this is most definitely war.

I'm certainly arrogant enough to tell an individual here that their comment is lacking. But I won't tell the American people that collectively they made the wrong choice. It was their willingness to buck the established political order 250 years ago that made them a great nation. They could've stuck with the political elite of the day- the British monarchy- and likely they still would've been ok. But that's not the American way. I'm NOT saying Donald Trump is George Washington. Trump appalls me. What I'm saying is that I'll withhold judgment on the choice that America made.

0,"Trump does not have a conservative alternative to the Affordable Care Act; the Affordable Care Act itself is the conservative alternative to a single payer plan that would insure everyone (Medicare for all.)  What came to be known as the Affordable Care Act, or colloquially, Obamacare, was percolating at least since the early 1970s when President Nixon proposed, and Sen. Edward Kennedy opposed, a plan that was very much like the ACA.  Trump and his allies in Congress will likely be able to repeal large parts of the ACA -- but obviously they have nothing with which to replace it; they never did. The result will be that millions of people will have no health insurance.  As a result, the rate and number of abortions will increase -- no matter who Trump appoints to the bench or what legislation is passed or what executive actions Trump takes or rescinds.  The 'pro-life' folks bought a pig in a poke.

The scenario, pass it but hope the House doesn't pass it before it can go to committee was a canard and would have been a complete disaster.

0,"Maybe the Left does it just as much, but my impression is that the Right tends to dismiss actions based on perceived intent. For example, Mueller's actions are biased, so his indictments are without merit. He has an """"agenda"""" so his charges are null and void. He is ignoring Hillary, so that's unfair, dismissing his actions against Trump aides. Manafort is being forced to testify against the admin., so it can't be the truth. And Trump's favorite, """"they are just upset about losing"""". So why is it a valid argument to say, if your intent is suspect, your findings are dismissed? First, I posit that this is because of the """"bad seed"""" narrative we are taught that originates in the bible. In this scenario, the world is divided into good and bad people. If you are a bad person, whatever you promote is not to be believed. Now the Right does not think they are perfect, because they understand the importance of humility. They are better than to think they are better than other people.

If you disagree, tell us what Trump means by this:  """"So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal.

The optics and symbolic message of a withdrawal is more of an ideological battle rather than actual material impacts.   Trump could have stayed within the non-binding 'treaty' and ignored the goals and little would change for the US, but he chose to do this for symbolic reasons.  In actual measured data from 2015, China alone generates 30% of the world's total CO2 emissions, more than double the US, and more than triple the entire EU.   Canada generates around 1/20th of what China does.  Look at the economic miracle of china and how rapid economic growth has made many parts of china prosperous.  Yet they are not done.

0,"I HATE that Trump was elected, but apparently you don't understand how the electoral college works.  There are 538 electors from the 50 states. That number is based on the number of Representatives for each state (435 total based on state population) + 2 for the 2 senators for each state + 3 for DC. In most states, a electoral college voter CANNOT vote """"against the state majority"""" (even if the """"majority"""" is only 51% - which means essentially 49% of the state's votes """"didn't count"""") without repercussions (in some states civil, in others criminal).

If you're referring to """"ecumenism,"""" I can't read Italian so have no sense of the effect of the word in the original but in translation """"ecumenism of hate"""" is obviously a rhetorical device. The point is the political alliance with fundamentalists has had and will continue to have adverse, anti-life effects. Donald Trump is really president, he really stokes bigotry, he's really ideologically aligned with rapacious capitalists invested in fossil fuels indifferent to the fate of the planet, the GOP is determined to deprive millions of access to health care in order to deliver tax cuts to their donors. The anxiety that far-right Christians enable a perilous agenda really exists.

Me kept his grace as he was insulted like no other president in history since the Civil War. The word grace does not apply to either Clinton or Trump. I will miss Obama. Maybe Hillary will appoint him to the Supreme court. He would be the only Protestant on the court. He would be the most qualified justice in recent history.

0,"So, what I find missing here as with other articles, is the evidence that only 1 media outlet runs in the positive: Fox.  Just one.  Even the centrists are negative here.  If it were just the usual more liberal outlets that would support a simple bias.  With 95% running  negative it suggests more than simple bias.  It suggests that a majority smell serious trouble with the Trump administration carrying the stink of Abscam, Watergate, et al.  We have the Wall St. Jrnl. publisher on record stating that they would be fair in their coverage of Trump.  Yet, they are still reporting negatively on his efforts.  The author would see this as collusion with the liberal outlets.  However, at some point you come to the conclusion that sentient minds find Trump in the wrong.

0,"Trumpster aside, the US voter registration system is susceptible to abuse by non- citizens,  Currently, we do not issue any general-use document intended to confirm both identity and citizenship. While a U.S. passport may be used for both these purposes, it is a travel document. Most people seek a passport when planning a trip and only a relatively small proportion of the population holds a passport at any given time. 9  As a result, the preferred form of documentary identification in the United States is the drivers’ license. Drivers’ licenses are issued by the states, pursuant to a widely varying body of state-specific laws and regulations. Currently, twelve states and the District of Columbia allow illegal aliens to obtain a drivers’ license.  So, tell me why tightening down voter fraud when it may have handed our current Commander-in Chief his presidency?  Frankly, if he had anything at all to hide, he certainly would NOT be pursing this.

All these people are ignoring the fact that it doesn't really matter who hacked the e-mails. What really mattered was what was said in the e-mails, which exposed the dishonesty and ruthless behaviour of the DNC and the liberal media in rigging their primary process in favour of Hillary, as opposed to Bernie, to win the Democratic nomination and then the White House, at any cost.  Hillary lost because fundamentally Trump, for all his faults,  is a better person. She is disliked by a lot of people who see her as a cold, entitled, dishonest, morally bankrupt and corrupt elitist who has used her position for wealth and power and who really doesn’t care about the general population.  The Democrats and ilk are trying to set up Trump for an impeachment within the next few years.  If so, there will be a tremendous backlash against the Democrats in the mid-term elections.

Mr. Obama was a lawyer...a great orator to be sure...but a lawyer nonetheless with little obvious experience or knowledge that we know of, which would qualify him to lead our country.  President's use to answer the door of """"the house that the people built"""", some even answered the telephone.

Did they do the same for their employer, as after all people went to great lengths to help them and this would only be fair.

It is Congress' job to come-up with the best plan and as he has stated, he will sign whatever Congress puts before him.  What is happening in Congress concerning healthcare is exactly how the system is supposed to work, the People making their voices heard thru their elected representatives to get the best compromise plan possible.  It isn't pretty, it isn't fast, but it is the American way of governing.  Additionally, I would argue that the President not taking the lead on this issue is a good thing.  We have had a far too powerful executive branch since the Great Depression which was/is contrary to the American system of governing.

Was this fabricated document used to obtain FISA warrants against (then candidate) DJT, Paul Manafort and others? That would make all the """"evidence"""" collected """"fruit of the poisoned tree"""" (legally speaking, means illegally obtained), and any investigations that were opened because of a FISA warrant obtained from using this document as proof and any evidence obtained from these investigations should also be cosndered """"fruit of the poisoned tree.""""  With Mr. Mueller's (reported) move to start investigating the Podesta Group, I am heartened that he's actually doing his job and following the evidence to wherever it leads, rather than starting with the assumption that Trump was colluding with the Russians. And I hope Mr. Mueller proves me right.

0,"The economic relationship that has developed between Mexico and the US has been one of mutual advantage. It has evolved as a free competitive market and bears all the hallmarks of efficiency that Adam Smith would expect. Nobody has been coerced, so deals have been made only when both parties benefit.  Often in economics we discuss efficiency, and as a counterpoint we bring up the notion of equity, or fairness. Efficiency and fairness are two separate outcomes, and you rarely get one without sacrificing the other.  If Trump wants fairness, he's going to have to sacrifice efficiency, which will reduce the wealth and well-being of Americans and their trading partners. Trump (among others) needs to understand more of economics. There are very seldom good outcomes, and never efficient outcomes, when the government interferes in markets and distorts prices. What makes sense in business in the micro scale does not work in the macro economy. Trump and America, and us too, I guess, are doomed!

0,"Dr. Garcia is making the case for removing Trump because Trump is not able to perform the duties his office.  I think Dr. Garcia is manifestly correct in that assessment, but the remedy for removing a president who is not able to perform his/her duties is NOT impeachment. It's a process even more cumbersome than impeachment, laid out in Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. I think there are grounds to impeach Trump; I think he was already guilty of impeachable offenses before he lowered his hand after taking the oath. But impeachment is, and should be, a difficult process, with both political and legal aspects. I'm confident that there are congressional staff persons researching the process and how it might apply to the facts that are being discovered by the special counsel and congressional investigations. I believe the grounds are there; but we have to wait for the process to unfold. We also have to see how much courage and integrity congress can summon.

Humanitarian aid has no connection to providing further financial aid targeted for rebuilding the infrastructure that Puerto Rico has let decay over decades.  Puerto Rico is a territory, one that only in June just voted to become a state.  Prior to declaring bankruptcy in May of this year, they previously voted 4 separate times to not join the United States and to not pay individual income tax.  It is particularly notable that this last June's election occurred roughly one month after their bankruptcy filing.  Until Puerto Rico cleans up their financial books & establishes a pathway to solvency, the current 50 states must consider whether it is humanitarian for the taxpayers to spend money rebuilding Puerto Rico.

The repeat the mantra that Russia """"hacked"""" the election, but they really only mean helped release some emails.  Why would they use such a loaded term that confuses the situation?

Trump will pass, and many more presidents will happen. America is much bigger than any one person, or any radical elements that may lift their heads now and then. The KKK, Neo-Nazis, and supremacists have risen and fallen many times already. They will fall again, by their own hatred and violent ways. The South lost the Civil War. Their statues were a remembrance to their loss. They softened the sting. To tear them down, at this late date, is adding insult to injury, and swinging the pendulum too far in one direction. The swing-back, equally as far, was inevitable. Let them have the symbols of their defeat, to sop their sorrows in.

Unfortunately, given the intransigence of the last 1700 years there will be no hierarchical movement to change this during our lifetimes.  Judging from the past, the future will simply bring more of the same as more and more of the laity feel that their spiritual needs have been minimized by a Church seeking to continue its grasp on sacerdotal control under the guise of the questionable """"holiness"""" of celibacy as opposed to the """"holiness"""" matrimony.

Given these facts, how has he done anything but acknowledge the very essence of the troubling concern that the Trump campaign sought to create back channels to the Russian government during the course of the general campaign in order to obtain information to use against Clinton?  Whether or not Trump Jr., Kushner, and Manafort actually received intelligence concerning Clinton at the meeting is irrelevant, as Trump Jr. went to the meeting in expectation of obtaining such information.

I find it sad that MSW would take this opportunity to focus on a Democratic loss in a heavily Republican state that Trump won by 20 points rather than question the motives of people who would willingly elect a goon like Gianforte. As for why Republicans continually give Trump, Gianforte and others a pass, as many have noted, their white spite is what motivates their voting behavior and there is nothing Democrats can do to change that. Only a lobotomy would help.

As far as I can tell in this instance, the third parties are the mainstream media.  Note that media is supposed to report factual news.  Interpretation should be labeled as such and placed under the heading of opinion not news.  A non-biased media would have discussed pros and cons of their interpretation and at least entertained the notion that Trump's intent was different from what they inferred.  In my own opinion, discarding the media interpretation and listening directly to Trump, I see no suggestion as to the moral equivalence of the philosophies and teachings of various groups.  What he did say is that violence and extremism are bad no matter who practices them.  I agree.  The car killing incident is a separate matter undertaken by one person.  Inexcusably bad.

Burke and his toadies were behind some of the dumb stunts against the pope over the last few weeks like the posters.  I don't think that Burke will be effective nor do I think that Bannon thinks he will (although Bannon wouldn't mind being rid of that meddlesome priest.)

Better yet, where are your eyes and ears; haven't you paid attention to Trump's speeches and tweets for the past couple of years, stirring anger, and fear of groups of people (those not white)?  Trump's pattern of politicizing and exploiting tragedies to pump up his cult, and to deflect from investigations of Russian interference in our elections is anti-American. Why wouldn't a president care about foreign interference in the integrity of our electoral process?

0,"Great column.  It is almost beyond embarrassing that we still need to explain basic economics to some Canadians. If our government pursues a protectionist agenda, costs for the vast majority of consumer items will go up... fast.  Your salaries, on the other hand, will not.  Will there be more jobs?  Maybe, but most low skill positions in manufacturing have already been replaced via automation so don't count on an employment boom anytime soon.  In the end, under a protectionist policy, consumer prices will rise without access to low-cost labour, and wages will stagnate given the relatively small market for domestically produced goods.  Despite what Donald Trump and his followers may preach, some problems simply don't have easy answers.  Be very careful what you wish for.  You just might get it.

Now instead of paying 50 cents a litter at the pump plus the provincial load and GST, we have gas way over a buck a litter. Well clearly; we have to pay the American's for processing Canada Oil, we have to pay there workers and we have to pay international prices. There is one group and only one group responsible for this and it is our political class. Why I do not know, but when I see Brian with Trump I can imagine. In the next election we need them to go. Canada Oil for every Canadian first and sell the excess (3 million barrels a day) at the international price. If the US does not want it there are lots who do. Do the same with natural Gas as Canada is  the second largest exporter of this stuff, again at made up US prices of 20 cents on the dollar, and Canada will be back on the road to achieve.

Last night I watched a program in which a pollster interviewed a dozen Trump voters in Ohio and he asked them many questions, most of which went something like this, """"How would you feel if Donald Trump reneged on his promise to do x, y, or z?"""" In every single case, it didn't matter to these voters one bit. They were loyalists to the core and were not deterred by any fact presented to them that might mar their view of their new Supreme Leader. Other questions addressed the Russian hacking scandal. Concerning that the Trump voters simply did not believe that Russia did it, saying that it was the biased """"liberal media"""" who was making it all up.

Ryan would not do this and just said he was willing to ask the House to discuss the bill with the Senate-- leaving it open to pass the bill and send it to Trump. Another problem resulting from rushing things, mistrust, and secrecy in the Republicans' procedure. Plus lack of leadership by Ryan and McConnell who should have dealt with this (they could have sought a commitment from Trump not to sign the bill until it went to the conference committee).

But as the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and earlier in Vietnam have proven, there are no more conventional wars, and new tactics have to be implemented. Trump is an idiot if he seriously believes that increasing military spending will make a difference in future defense or wars. Changing the focus to fighting terrorism is a good start, but what is really needed is for the United States and other Western powers to stop invading other nations under false pretences, and to stop supporting dictatorships like Saudi Arabia. That itself will greatly reduce the risk of terrorist attacks. There is no excuse for any terrorist attack, but there are reasons for them. And, no, they're not religious. They're always political.

1,"The author is missing the elephant in the room.  I am not a paid political pundit but I saw a Trump victory days after his announcement of his intention to run in the primary.  Trump won for two distinct reasons.  Firstly, he is genuine.  People are sick and tired of politicians repeating the same focused group catch phrases and talking points and Trump spared no expense in this regard.  Rosie O'Donnell DOES have a fat, ugly face.  Fiorna DOES look like Skeletor.  GW Bush DIDNT have the IQ to be President, and the last thing anyone needed was another Bush in the White house.  Secondly, Clinton was so uninspiring and boring that when she spoke you wanted to just change the channel.  With Trump, whether you liked him or hated him, you wanted to hear what he had to say.  It was like a tea candle trying to compete with a tiger torch for oxygen.  Democrats couldn't have picked a more boring candidate.

A rich Catholic caring nothing for the poor, compared with a humanistic atheist in good conscience serving with DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS for example, serve to make the point. The abortion issue is an excuse for self-righteous political maneuvers. Trump promises Gorsuch will repeal ROE vs.Wade. He cannot without a consensus and their is no indication that he will try to get one. Bernard Law was an active supporter of the pro-life movement. Let me repeat this again: Law was an avid supporter of the pro-life movement. I am pro-life.

I'm not saying much on this issue of a definitive nature because I don't have a good handle on all the nuanced and legalistic arguments.....what I do think is that many people, even pundits, are either purposely or unintentionally allowing the criminal liability argument and the impeachment support argument to become conflated....which only muddies the water.

Religious freedom is just that. Are personal rights only  for those that conduct themselves in a manner that others do not agree with ? Yet some feel the need to force others to agree with an act or lifestyle that they do not agree with. One persons rights does not trump another's. No law can be made that can justify forcing a church to condone that which in the eyes of the church goes against the very doctrine that they teach. Nor should a law even be made to offer that protection for there already is. First Amendment to the Bill of Rights.

1,"I'm glad trump isn't a wuss like the previous president. Here's a couple other things he could do to yank cards from Kim Jung Porky's hand:  First, announce an initiative to invest in China's neighbors to build their economies. China loves the money our consumers give them for inexpensive products. China will slap down Porky if it's economic interests are threatened, and India and Vietnam would love to have the kind of business we give China.  Second, announce a major initiative towards nuke-interception. Reagan got respect with talk about SDI, and we certainly have better technology now. The ability to nullify Porky's nukes (and anyone else's) will stabilize the whole region, preventing Japan and South Korea from pursuing their own nukes. We're already working on the concept, so step it up. I refuse to believe that with AI going in to everything from autonomous trucks to sex toys, we can't apply some of that chip smarts to interceptor missiles.

That's Orwellian logic. We don't even know the Russians attempted to hack our election?

I don't like what I've seen in the appointments, but really all are pretty much the same small government vision that the Republican party has held for at least 50 years.  It seems that Democrats have over reached what they believe should be the role of government in American lives, roles that go well beyond defense, and regulation of commerce, (those being items that are central to our federation design).

Literally the depth of his expressed understanding was """"we're going to get a bill, and it's going to be great."""" Over and over.

As to ceasefires in Syria, the reason they failed in the past is because the USA, after encouraging, financing and arming the civil war for so many years, had still not given up on its hope of destroying the Syrian government. Hence the Islamist rebel groups that the USA used as proxies fought on.  The outcome of this latest ceasefire will depend on the USA's new strategy under Trump. If the plan remains to continue to destabilize Syria, then the ceasefire is unlikely to hold. But if Trump has moved away from the Obama-Clinton plan of toppling the Syrian government then this ceasefire, and future ones, will have a better chance of holding.

You are not offering anything serious to back up your claim that Trump is a good president and that the welfare of the country is his primary concern. Look at D.C.'s post: """"A man's thoughts are self evident in relation to his actions."""" That pretty much sums it up. I don't have any trouble understanding why people did not vote for Clinton and why they thought Trump might be a better alternative. But he has not measured up, either in behavior or policy. Far from it. He is already doing a 180 on some of his basic campaign promises (e.g. Health Care). And the only way he is going to change is for his supporters to stop playing the anti-Clinton/Obama games and hold him accountable.

Basically China wanting access to resources and Russia markets for their military equipment sales therefore blocking every positive action. NATO hides behind the American coattails with the likes of Trudeau and Merkel refusing to put their military at risk.  American presidents have been frustrated with the amount they have to spend to be the world s policeman.  Even Trump understood this but someone had to react to the dire results in Syria. Jimbo, remarkably naïve policies such as Trudeau sanctioning 27 Syrian leaders are never going to work.   NATO is going to have to step up and protect the innocent because the UN is a lost cause.

This incident was made even worse when a separate news report detailed that Trump, indeed, had previously known about David Duke when Trump considered running as a Reform Party candidate, and David Duke was also a candidate in that party. And just yesterday, one of Trump's many tweets got him in more trouble when he re-tweeted a quote from Mussolini, the former fascist dictator of Italy during WWII.

Canada has a long history, with its selfish immigration policy, of vacuuming up medical doctors and nurses from the poorest continents in the world. In Saskatchewan alone there are hundreds of doctors working who did their training in Africa and had been previously working there, before Canada, being a brain-drain-extraordinaire, vacuumed them up to serve our medical needs here.  It is a bit rich, then, that our holier-than-though politicians strut out in their pious garb to pose as rescuers of Trump's abortion ban.  Such hypocrisy. Canada has more blood on its hands, in its removal of medical caregivers from their overseas places needing their services, than Trump.

0,"Liberal democracy is indeed under threat, and those who treasure it had better be prepared to defend it. The great shame of the media in the US election was to report on the Trump - Pence campaign as a carnival of the absurd, with the unanswered question: """"somebody (else) is going to do something about this, right?""""  Well, nobody did anything to stop it. Instead, the media, fearful of being branded as biased, remained passive. Witness NBC's Matt Lauer's interviews with Trump and Clinton. Spineless lickspittle. In Contrast, see Rosie Barton's on-air fact checking of Chris Alexander during the last Canadian election. That's who I want on the front lines of my culture war.  To protect liberal democracy, the media - the Globe and Mail included - need to re-establish reputations for JOURNALISM. Where is this generation's Mike Wallace, kicking in doors with a 60 minutes' news crew in tow? The public doesn't want false 'fairness', it wants JUSTICE.  It wants blood.  Give it to them!

So now besides the Russian collusion fiasco of fake and unproven news, we're now going to switch to obstruction of justice fiasco, as no investigation has been stopped, but because of Comey's previous mistakes as itemized in the DOJ's memos advising President Trump to fire Comey, as well as Comey not making it public that President Trump was not being investigated in the Russian collusion case.

Not only had he meet with a high-placed Kremlin lawyer, it was to discuss state matters, including the Magnitsky Act. We know this is true because Donald Trump Jr admitted he was there with Kushner and Paul Manafort, and likely several others, and Trump Jr revealed the content of the discussion, the mutual US-Russia sanctions.  Kushner needs to have his clearance revoked immediately.

The fact that Dreamers didn't understand & activists they depended on to tell them chose to give them a fairy tale that all their problems were solved is not a reason to perpetuate the fairy tale.  The fact that the EO was not rescinded on day 1, which Trump had every legal right to do, and instead took time and effort to design a 6 month period to start winding down the program and demand Congress address the problem before the people affected are at risk is not cowardly, inhumane or any other epithet you want to throw out there. It's one of the few thoughtful acts he's done as President and the fact he wants Congress to give real legal protection not subject to a judge wiping it out overnight should be cause for praise not vitriol.

If, like Trump promised the other day, he comes up with a health care policy that gives everyone (he said everyone) better care for less money (he said less money) without gutting social programs, Social Security, Medicare, etc, that would be welcome.  As for your assertion """"That’s right, they’re working for free"""", I had not heard that-do you have a source?

I suppose that all the demonstrators just happen to bring along a lot of 60 mm mortars, their AK-47s, and those shoulder held RPGs.

That has little to do with Trump or Sanders. And as far as Trump not being the status quo candidate, that is incorrect. He is the status quo, living in billionaire style in his golden castle profiting from tax break upon tax break, in fact apparently not paying taxes for decades. Anyone who voted for him expecting a miracle in the way of taking from the rich and giving to the poor is delusional. Hugh

WOW Coffman really went out on a limb.  Let's hear from Coffman on how Trump and his economic polices are working for America, how Trump has improved the economy, improved peoples lives, increased salaries, what about all the jobs he was going to create, keep corporations from moving overseas, bring back funds hidden overseas.  Trump has done nothing and Coffman says nothing.  The distraction works perfectly.

Together with modern science and the heart of natural family planning there is so much more the Catholic Church could magnify rather than let lay dormant.   Life before birth and after birth seem intrinsically called for in Charin's Universal Consciousness and overlaps with the real vigor and heartbeat of respect for God's creation that could contrast with the present denial and lack of leadership America is taking with regard to conservation and especially man made climate change.    It is deeply immoral to side with delay and deceit and the present fossil fuel loaded Trump government being turned into a branch office of multinationals like fossil fuel industry and banker backers.

I've seen some air head leaders but Trump is coming close to the top. The next election will be the biggest landslide in US history if Trump even makes it that far.

0,"Good analysis. As to pinning down Trump to specifics - we're all waiting on that one.
"
1,"Trump's career in politics has its roots in the racist drivel that came to be known as 'birtherism.' His speech announcing his candidacy was notable for its racism.  Racism permeated his campaign. As he occasionally paid lip service to other constituencies in order to """"expand his base"""", the base itself remained, and remains, steadfastly racist. Steve Bannon's chief function in the campaign and in the White House is to serve a guarantor to the base that Trump will and does remain faithful to the racist roots of his campaign. His refusal to attend the NAACP Convention is not only because he's a coward (although he is certainly that); it's also and especially because he doesn't want the base to think he's softening. The base -- the ones who will support him even if he shoots someone on Fifth Ave., the 'Deplorables' -- the base remains racist: always was, always will be. Trump too.
"
0,"People were too optimistic about change coming from Donald Trump.  He was and still is a political neophyte and probably always will be.  He vastly underestimated just how conservative the Republican party can be.  His own political opinions have changed so much since his inauguration that his credibility among his base base (no error) would be lower than ever except for their visceral hatred of the Democrats.
"
0,"Just wait until Trump's group presents their """"findings of voter fraud"""" (because you know that's a foregone conclusion in their minds), they'll be pointing out whichever state as """"a problem"""" and then we'll really see some anger from the states back at him.  Trump & friends seem to like to deflect through a bent mirror, every time a problem for them comes up, they're innocent but that other guy did something kind of like it: Russian collusion?  That was a Clinton thing!  Voter suppression?  Nope, vote cheating (which still doesn't explain how they won anyway, but whatever).  And so it goes.
"
0,"Nixon didn't have anything to do with Kennedy's murder.What was his motive?  He wasn't the VP, a heartbeat from the Presidency, like your buddy Johnson was. The assassination united the country behind Johnson, not Nixon. That would be expected and as good a motive for murder as any detective could find.  And who chose to run against Johnson in 1964? Another good buddy of yours, Barry Goldwater. He got swamped in '64. . So Nixon has Kennedy done in so he can wait 8 years until Johnson finishes 2 terms, hoping to make a comeback in '72?  Nope, your all wet on that one.  Nixon had no great love for the Kennedy's and that is the craziest, most  debunked conspiracy theory there's been. Trump is no different than most of us, he likes a good conspiracy theory, but its mostly entertainment.  Like playing a game of  """"Clue"""" . Communists killed Kennedy. The obvious assumption is usually the most logical. Oswald was probably promised Cuban or Russian citizenship for his 'comradeship'  They lied

But what mystifies me is when someone says they are pro-life (I have many doubts about that with Mr. Trump) that somehow that means they can do something about it in the white house. No Republican since Roe v. Wade was successful in this regard. Also, I wonder why we think that reducing the number of abortion clinics equals reducing abortion. That was not true before Roe v. Wade, as it is today. In my view the bottom line is not merely to make abortion less available, but to find ways to help pull woman out of poverty who tend more to higher incidences of abortion. Mitigating unwanted pregnancies should be the main focus. What candidate has the best chances of helping to do that? It would seem to me that this is a common ground that pro-life and pro-choice supporters could gather around.
"
0,"No one is entitles to free health care .  Your personal situation is none of my business , but from what you have said you are one of the people getting reduced medical care at other taxpayers expense .  Obamacare is failing across America . If Trump did nothing it would fail on it's own because people like you feel someone else needs to pay for your care.   People who are having to pay for their medical insurance hate Obamacare because the deductibles are rising off the charts . Those getting it for free or not paying the real cost of their health insurance love it because they are getting something for nothing. You want others to pay the real cost of your medical care , and that's wrong.   I get a kick out of those of you saying the republican plan is a disaster before it's even written yet. Both houses have to write the law before we'll know  As long as 40 percent are paying nothing to support America at the expense of those who are being forced to pay for them , we are in trouble.

Some people may not have the financial or practical means available to get a divorce, but if you do have those means? DIVORCE THEM.  Because if one member of a couple believes the President should endorse police brutality and the other member believes that is balls-to-the-wall insane, that is not a disagreement you’re going to find common ground on. You can use all the measured voices and positive words you want. It’s not a question of disagreement about the most effective way to load the dishwasher, or even whether trickle-down economics works. Those are opinions that might be altered by showing compelling factual evidence.

0,"Like all media the G & M regularly changes its programs. For decades they've been demonizing the NDP as fiscal incompetents who would run the economy into the ground. But now they're trumpeting the potential advantages of Jagmeet Singh as Prime Minister. Why? Because Singh is the embodiment of the G & M's top priority agenda - increased immigration and multiculturalism. The G & M wants Canadians to believe that millions of Canadian suburbanites will vote for Singh, not in spite of his being a Sikh with a beard and a turban, but because he's a Sikh with a beard and a turban, he is the personification of the new multicultural Canada. But clearly, going forward to the 2019 election, after months of glorifying Singh as an amazing new leader of the new multicultural Canada, well ahead of the next election they will again demonize the NDP as fiscal incompetents who would run the economy into the ground. Clever propagandizing by the G & M.

That's also why most of the eggs in Snohomish County's basket are in a light rail line proposed to dogleg to light-to-medium density Paine Field, with virtually nothing to improve today's commutes out there, nor for the next 20 years.

They did not guarantee a Clinton victory. They went over the odds and reported that the polls were tightening as election night approached and pointed out which states Trump needed to flip to win. Trump did lose the popular vote and only won the Electoral college because three states narrowly went for him when they'd been polling for Clinton earlier.

Embarrassing and no self respect.  I hope republicans don't keep him in office.  The bigger concern is the GOP got what they wished for and have """"the keys to America"""" and are really messing it up.  No GOP leadership, certainly no leadership in the WH, and admittedly Dems have not offered up any strong leaders so far.  Saddly the real losers are the American people.  While Trump's rhetoric has resonated well with much of the population, his """"closet ideologies"""" are self serving and not in the best interest of the American people.  WH needs to be cleaned out, including Pence.

The problem seems to be that Clinton supporters are annoyed information about Mr. Trump was not released...somehow, I think  if some had, many liberals would be cheering.  The fact is Clinton did do some questionable things.  Pointing fingers to try to shift the blame is both pointless and childish, and she (and she and others should realize it).

The Air Force is capable of creating emergency control towers. And now Trump Tweets that the Puerto Ricans always want hand-outs. He didn't whine about Texans and Floridians who needed disaster assistance whining about handouts after Irma. Maybe it's because TX and FL have electoral votes? All those companies who sent workers to FL to restore their electrical network: Why can't those same workers be flown from Miami to PR? Trump is showing his true colors.

The reliability of the future alliance will depend on how American continue this milking scheme, that is where the TPP kicks in.  Trump doesn't want to pay for it, this why he withdraws from TPP, in which Vietnam is posed to gain 20% in their GDP but US almost nil. It is turning into something not that American like it or not, but can afford it or not. The big brother status brings  prestige, but also means you have to foot the bill, something neither Chinese nor Russian want to play - they only want to protect their own interest. The so called challenge to American status is nothing but straw man, the core issue is American want it or not.

Because you look stupid, pathetic, immature, lonely, liberal and communist.

0,"Good luck with that.  It’s not like an overdue mortgage on a house. China bought U.S Treasury bills, which pay both principal and interest under specific conditions. China cannot demand prepayment of these debts since they are contractually fixed. Meanwhile, the U.S. can easily impose import tariffs on Chinese goods and, since it has complete dominance in the financial sector, it can make it extremely difficult for Chinese banks to operate worldwide. Why do you think the ruble and yuan were worthless during the Cold War? Furthermore, who says the policy of containment which worked so well with the Soviet Union wouldn't work with China?  The U.S is a real superpower both in the economic and military sense. The Chinese just think they are. Trump simply reminded them that they are not equals and he can do as he pleases.

0,"""""Trump’s core constituency is the white working class — usually defined as those without a college degree.""""  Only 26% of the jobs in this country require a college degree.  It doesn't require a degree to start a business ... ask Bill Gates.  It doesn't require a degree to be a home builder, an electrician, plumber, or HVAC guy, or a hair designer or interior designer.  You can be a one-man business doing home remodelling, or landscaping, cement work, or an arborist.  I've know good auto mechanics with experience making over $100,000/yr with no college degree.  Today, unless a degree is in a STEM subject, a college degree from a major university costs too much.  All it means is that you've been thoroughly indoctrinated.  Many of these people with no college degrees make a better living than a Phd in Philosophy (or most other liberal arts degrees) who has $200,000 in student loan debt and can't figure out his TV remote, much less find a job outside of Starbucks.  Who's smarter?

Given the much larger refugee numbers taken in under Obama, the new case-by-case Trump policy for Syria would probably have to run for decades before it could correct, on a per capita basis for Syrian refugees in recent history, for the massively pro-Muslim anti-non-Muslim approach reported during Obama's reign... ... well, reported in some venues, that is...  ... by the way, where do I find your post condemning Obama for strongly favouring Syrian Muslims over Christians?

0,"Mainstream media throughout the world have lost touch with their respective citizens.  They themselves have become special interest groups, who have become mouth pieces for other special interest groups.  As such, most of so-called """"news"""" is biased, and are mostly opinion pieces.  The Globe & Mail itself has sadly degenerated into this format.  Trump may be wrong on many things, but he is right in calling out the media as rigged, biased and dishonest.  For me, recognizing that this is an opinion piece, it is unbalanced and biased writings such as this writer's that prevents me from accepting the many promotional offers that I receive via email for subscribing to the Globe.

No, a Trump White House demonstrates that democracy is broken and needs fixing badly. Trump is naturally exploiting the gaping flaws in the political and electoral system instead of trying to repair or at least mitigate their effects. Why would he try to fix a system that is broken in his favour?

0,". . . yeah, I like this idea the more I think about it.  I'm surprised Trump hasn't already put out the call on Twitter.  Think about it. 39% of America. . . . ok 35% of America shows up for an Amish style wall raising, they work at night by torchlight, and the wall gets built """"li' dat"""", the swamp is embarrassed and bypassed, and the world sees what true, patriotic Americans are capable of.  Forget relying on the """"government"""" to get this important and vital wall built.  Obviously, the """"government"""" is a bunch of swamp dwelling losers.  And, too many loser Dems pay taxes, so they'll try to have a say on what the """"government""""/swamp does with tax money.  So, Trump and his base need to just march down there (they should go during the day and preserve the torch fuel for working at night) and just start building the danged thing.  Trump should send his plane for Pocho, RTH, lespark, etc.  No doubt they would help.  They could stay at RTH's Arizona house (IF they needed rest).

Now there's much to criticize in both Obama's and Trump's edicts but to excoriate one while giving a pass to the other is not particularly even-handed.

"
0,"see how your boy Trump is going to profit while President:  Trump has decided “that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.” Trump is simply setting up a funnel for foreign government donations to the government. Since that funnel runs through his hotel, it boosts the brand value of his hotel and, thus, Trump. It doesn’t prevent diplomats from choosing to stay in his hotel to curry favor with him. It will still flatter him, because he flatters easily. Also, we will never know if he even donates the money, because he doesn’t provide proper accounting documentation for anything, and it’s not clear how “foreign government payments” would be separately accounted for anyway.

Will CO2 levels reach an equilibrium or will they continue to rise?  I am so sick and tired of reading articles written by radical Climate Change alarmists that make up facts and site antidotal evidence.  It will be nice to have a debate based on actual science without being bullied by those that claim the science is settled.  Science is not decided by poles, journalists or politicians.  Why is it that the alarmists do everything they can to shut down debate and discredit anyone that does not hold to Climate Change orthodoxy?  Is it because their pet theories won’t hold up to proper objective scientific scrutiny?
