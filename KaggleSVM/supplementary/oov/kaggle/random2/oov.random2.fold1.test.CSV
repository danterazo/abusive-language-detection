0,"continued.  And it’s all out there.  None of this was ever hidden.  Trump and his family don’t even really try to deny the above; they revel in it.  They are narcissists supreme.  There is *nothing* admirable about this person.  Nothing at all.  And he has passed it on to his children.  I’m always reminded of a tweet that DT Jr. sent years ago where he was praising how the hired help worked for his family over Christmas or something, and he posted like “love loyalty to us!”  They are just the most openly despicable people.  And so *obviously* so.  They don’t even hide it.  Their evil and hypocrisy is *open*.  They praise themselves for it.  I genuinely can’t think of a worse person in public life.  And he's a traitor.
"
0,"Good. It's done. And it had to be done. NOW, get on to the other things that have to be done: 1. Cut services. 2. Raise taxes on oil, coal, fish, and timber industry. 3. Statewide sales tax. 4. Statewide income tax.

0,"Well, basically they are looking to talk to anyone who saw somebody shooting somebody else near the park’s west boat ramp, north of East Union Avenue entrance at about 7:20 p.m. Sunday night.  Should be pretty straightforward for anyone who actually saw anything.  For everyone else who just wants to know more details, you're gonna have to wait.  Breaking News.
"
0,"'British-born', 'home-grown', 'self-radicalised' etc. are disgustingly primitive and self-serving expressions of the so-called 'liberal values'. The fact is, that whether foreign-born or not, all, I repeat ALL terrorists, whether a whole cell, or a 'lone wolf' can trace their ancestry to a certain part of the world, where a particular religious ideology or dogma is prevalent. Had those people, or their parents and grandparents not been allowed to immigrate en masse, we wouldn't face the scourge of islamic terrorism we are facing today. It is that simple.

0,"You allowed your dog to run up to people and stick his nose into them?  I don't know about your dog being shot 20 times but it sure would have been once.  I carry pepper spray so he would have been at least sprayed.  Be a responsible owner and keep your dog under control.
"
0,"MA:  Go spout your communism in another country.  If public sector unions quit using taxpayer dollars to support legislation and political candidates that do not represent the taxpayers, if unions quit forcing workers to join, if union leaders were not corrupt, if Democrats would quit advocating wealth redistribution, if unions quit forcing members to vote certain ways, etc, etc.  Bullies, gangs, and violence are mostly a thing of the past and were tactics used by both sides.  You should be proud of your union brothers and sisters, I am also.  Unions, particularly in the private sector, are necessary and useful.  In the public sector not so much.  """"Right to work"""" produces goods and services that union members utilize.  As you can see there are two sides to this issue.

I do believe Mr Norland suggests we need to look perhaps at the greater system and that it inadvertently, or maybe purposely, was set to miss a swath of the population. I think he suggests review and adjustment of said regulations.

0,"Not at all.  If it isn't verifiable or predictable or capable of replication, it isn't science, it's religion.  Global Warming is science; what can be done to alleviate, reverse, or otherwise affect it is conjecture and speculation at best, even though displayed with graphs and charts using unverifiable algorithms to mimic factual data in a Power Point presentation.  GIGO still applies.  A  PhD doesn't usually result in Godlike powers, mostly just in arrogance in relation to  those who don't have one.  My doctorate is useless for predicting the future; so are all those others in more scientific disciplines.  A Doctor of Divinity has just as much chance of finding a 'solution' for Global Warming as a PhD in Chemistry, Physics does at this point in 'scientific' knowledge of the subject.  I'll see your hypothesis and raise you by forty-three other hypotheses from scientists around the world who may actually have validity that yours does not!  Just like any religion--whose God is God?

Justice Ginsburg made an error, likely did violate Canon 5 and did apologize.  Certainly, as a citizen she has every right to express her opinion regarding any topic she chooses.  I'm a staunch defender of the First Amendment.  However, her comments regarding Presidential Candidate Trump were a mistake and, quite likely, did violate the Code of Judicial Ethics.  As a Supreme Court Justice, Ms Ginsburg is held to a different standard than that of a mere citizen.  I'm a fan of Justice Ginsburg and am happy to accept her apology and move on.  Those who oppose her positions on social/political/economic issues, however, are only too happy to use her comments as a club.  I'm sure she regrets her ill-advised statements.  regards, Gary

0,"Why not dip into the Superfund that was set up after 1985 oil collapse? Billions of dollars been collected since 1985 and requiring 75% passage from Legislature to dip into it. Why is our time and money going after the Permanent Fund, during this latest Oil Collapse? If the legislature can't get its act together, then People will stand up again like during the Yes, Yes, Yes campaign and pass our own legislation to have funds diverted to our terrible Education System. Alaska is now ranked 53rd in the US in 4th grade education, we can only go up.

Let's see; """"Racist""""---started a civil war to maintain slavery as an institution, founded the KKK as their paramilitary wing to kill blacks and Republicans, established Jim Crow and segregation, and founded the welfare state to ruin the black family structure and buy black votes through slavery to Democrat government handouts; check. """"Misogynist""""---see the treatment of Sarah Palin, Condoleezza Rice (could also be filed under """"racism""""), Betsy Devoss, Nancy Reagan, Melania Trump, etc. """"Islamophobic""""---A word without meaning, unless you are speaking of the fear that Democrats have towards the truth of Sharia law and the teachings of the Koran actually seeing the light of day and being read and understood by the non-Muslim world. """"Homophobic""""---See the fear Democrats show towards Milo Yiannopolis.

In 1975, the Senate reduced the number of votes required for cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths, or 60 of the current one hundred senators.  That being said the vice-president votes in case of ties.  With two independents, including Bernie Sanders, a reasonably competent administration would be able to secure two votes in the Senate.  I've have never heard the term """"natural target"""" before.  Did it originate with you?  Finally what """"other nations"""" got into the middle in order to compete successfully?

"
0,"Your numbers are off because some of the areas you mention are NOT ENTIRELY along the rail route only a minute portion of the areas you mention have convenient access to the rail, therefore the bulk of the population will not bother to drive over to the parking lot were the train begins which happens to be far away since the areas you mentioned are fairly large and spread out. You're also falsely assuming most will take the train but reality is they won't despite the traffic woes. Finally, we don't even know what the fare will be. I'll give you a real world example of my cost analysis. TheBus, for example, charges $5 for a day pass or a round trip bus ticket. I would still rather drive within town to my destination of choice despite the traffic as my fuel consumption for the round trip drive is still less than the bus fare cost as well as the inconvenience of the bus.

People look at their bottom line charges and use them in determining how competitive the price they pay is.  Unfortunately some classes of communications pay a lower fee than their competitors.  The FCC is currently in a rulemaking procedure to determine if they need to change how this fund is generated, and if they need to change how it is applied to subsidize rural communications.

"
0,"A crime can't be established without an investigation to determine if a crime exists.  The investigation results from Russia's interference in our electoral process coupled with denials of meetings with adversaries by the Trump team deserves scrutiny as the meetings were later proven to have occurred. This would include Sessions """"forgetting"""" at least three meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign -- lying to Congress.  Donnie Trump admitted to his meeting, and that he emailed an invite to Kushner to meet with a Russian lawyer to get dirt on Clinton, which may or may have been illegal (TBD).  Kushner's failure to disclose foreign contacts on his security clearance application is illegal. His negotiating an arms deal with the Saudis also is questionable.  These are are just samples of many questionable actions that merit investigating. If nothing comes of it, the Trump team is cleared. If there are crimes, they should be held accountable under our nation's laws.
"
0,"Technically, from """"musket"""" advancing to the AR-15, is called progress. So its not just politicians that are or aren't inclined to be progressive. Cherry picking human values of choice is very much a part of all the social issues that continue to divide our culture and prevent real and just progress. Finding ways to have a supply of sticks to drag thru the mud has never been easier. And that's the kind of progress we don't need.
"
0,"It's amazing how few people understand the way the tax dodge work. We're sold on taxing the rich but many don't understand how IRAs offered only to that group protect thier money. The middle class is simple amazing in it's consistent act of voting against itself while being fooled into believing they either target the rich or protect those who don't wish to work. Now we're asked to support a tax because the pfd raid doesn't hurt us (according to the liberal house). Really? Losing $1200 per person doesn't hurt middle class families enough?

0,"Dear Mr MEC,  As you and the provincial government are more than keen to revive our township economy...  Please help us to break the red-tape that exists at the Joburg Property Company / local municipalities in relation to access / usage of un-used land space that is all over our townships. We want to get rid of dumping spaces and illicit trading, and use these vacant lands for business.  Nowadays tech enables development of un-conventional retail hubs + property development. But the council and JPC's processes are gatekeeping and do not enable swift access and use of land space that has not been used for over 20+ years.  As per your article, big retail chains [incl. fast food chains] have taken over, with less if not none of them being owned by Black youth in the 152 townships you've mentioned. We have ideas to execute, but we need land space as we can't afford mall rentals. Help us to grow the country's economy, convince JPC and municipalities to see our POV.
"
0,"I agree.  But I think even more can and should be done at the local level, whether by state or federal fiat. It's way past time for serious change. The deniers who constantly whine that it's not racism or racial bias need to take the blinders off. Those who deny that the """"thin blue line"""" has morphed into a symbol for us against them, for a gang in blue, with special rights to administer violent """"justice"""" to al--regardless of race--unencumbered with accountability, need to wake up. It's a deadly combination. The police have no constitutional duty to protect citizens. None.  What then, is their job?  To protect themselves by using deadly force, first and foremost,  from citizens, all citizens, about whom they feel even a frisson of fear?  Because that is what we increasingly see.

The LOGIC of that argument is exactly the same as the logic of the argument """"Christ chose only Jews to be apostles, therefore non-Jews cannot be ordained"""". In both cases the argument is """"Christ chose only <X> to be apostles, therefore non-<X> cannot be ordained"""". YOU are claiming that the first argument is good, the second is not. Since they are, in fact, exactly the same argument, either both are good or both are bad.  In fact, both are bogus arguments. Since you have nothing better -- and refuse to recognize that the actual argument for not ordaining women is """"women are inferior to men"""", you insist on pushing your bogus argument.

0,"Interesting that they don't see the public asked for the government we now have. We all know we pay too many taxes and that too many jobs are being sent out of the country. Bringing those jobs back is how middle income is made. Factories and manufacturing are high income jobs. Lower taxes is from smaller government. It is nuts to watch the EPA slowing gaining power to take control of my land if it has rain water flowing through it. Liberal government leads to too many controls. When schools take a mother's lunch away and replace it with their version of what's better, that, to me, shows the whole problem. The conversations listed above show the problem.

Yes there are computer models, but they have been proven to be spectacularly wrong. So in the meantime we are doing what politicians suggest we do, but we won't know if this is actually working for at least forty to fifty years down the road. By that time a lot of us will be gone, the politicians who enacted policies won't be around to answer for them.We can all agree that climate is changing, climate always has. The crux of the problem is that there are many that don't believe that what we are doing is sufficient to alter climate change. No one has stepped up and says it will, but in the religion of climate change simple questioning is heresy.Yet basis of all science is questioning . Most of the programmes to combat climate change involve paying to change behaviour, in the belief that we can buy our way out of this. Sheer madness.

0,"While I do not agree with Ms. Adam's statement to Ms. Lange, if in fact it occurred, it is a statement of opinion and as such is covered by the First Amendment. If Ms. Lange objects, the proper place to deal with that is at the ballot box the next time Ms. Adam's position is up for election. Until then they just have to deal with each other. People bringing lawsuits without reasonable cause cost more than our school districts can afford, and the resources they drain damage the education of our children. Ms. Lange is placing her needs above our kids' needs. Our school districts should not concede and settle such lawsuits when they are frivolous, otherwise they invite more of the same. If I were the school board, I would direct the attorneys to offer Ms. Lange the following statement from Ms. Adams: """"Sorry if my free speech hurt your feelings."""" No money. If that does not satisfy Ms. Lange, collect statements from her former staff damaging to her and counter sue. Two can play hardball.

I am trying to teach them how to THINK, how to be critical, in a world where new technologies, new materials, new ways of living pop up every day. And their education (not """"training"""", they are not seals) is separate from their accreditation, which is how it should be.  Now that Ryerson has been upgraded from community college to university, it is no longer in the business of job training, despite programs that look like job training.

In order to do that, they need to do training exercises for take offs during the day and during the night. You want to do these certifications in friendly waters. It doesn't mean the Carl Vinson strike group wasn't destined for North Korea. They were following standard protocol. Keep in mind also that these crews usually have hundreds of first time sailors onboard for their first six month tours. They need training too.

0,"For all the bluster from """"conservatives"""" (they aren't when you look at how much money they spend & how tax cuts for people making millions per year are more important than balancing the budget) about pushing coal the actual facts are clearly going the other way. Red states like Texas, Kansas and Wyoming have a growing percentage of their energy needs coming from solar and wind. Drive the interstate through Wyoming and its especially obvious. Fracking means more oil production which has mean more natural gas which is far cheaper than coal. In 10-15 years I'll bet solar and wind will provide more energy than natural gas. Nat gas, solar and wind are cheaper than coal. What's wrong with consumers paying less for energy?  Heck, even the coal museum in Kentucky recently converted to solar! For people who say they care about coal miners they'd be better off encouraging manufacturing of solar, wind and batteries (electric cars) in former coal areas than saying they're bringing back coal jobs.

Ideally for them, the Inquiry would evolve into a perpetual quasi-welfare program that has as vague and broad a mandate as possible, no end date, and a blank cheque for a budget signed by federal leaders that are so scared of the identity-political backlash that they will pay literally hundreds of millions of your tax dollars to placate those who demand it.

Two big differences from here: everyone runs in the same primary regardless of party (except presidential); and the state operates  both a same day election and a huge mail-in operation. The result of the first is that in many districts, the top two-- who go on to the General-- are  of the same party, usually Democrat.   Often  the favorite gets maybe  2/3 of the vote and a couple others scramble for the leftovers at 20%  or so each. The INCREDIBLE RESULTS:  With all this, it's total chaos.  Hundreds of thousands of votes still uncounted from that recent election!  Many  races, mostly for second, still undecided.  Few fingernails left.

The question is not and cannot be """"To whom does Pride belong?"""" It's a question without an answer. Instead, I suggest looking to the origins of Pride, which Geise does but drops the ball from that point on. Pride began as a protest against police raids on bathhouses in 1981 and a press that printed the names of those arrested. I remember because I was there. There was a tremendous amount of anger and the hostility on both sides was toxic. Sound familiar? Well it should. Here's the thing though... Since 1981 (well maybe not immediately), both sides worked hard at building bridges and reaching understanding. The example of police participation in Pride, not just to serve and protect, but as eager and happy participants is testament to the success of years of constructive dialogue. Pride destroyed those efforts the other day.

Bethel has the highest number of cabs per capita in the world - something like 80 cabs, and the cab cartels there would go nuts if uber tries to move in.

Vast sums of taxpayers’ money are expended on these federal employees.  Their actions have the potential to cause major impact at home, viz the efforts by the current occupant of the Oval Office to spark a war with N. Korea.  Rep. Gabbard’s national responsibilities on the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees make fact-finding trips abroad a required part of the job.

My question is how to account for the following: Each existing US common share (CCE) was converted into the right to receive one new common share (CCEP, European based company now) and $10.00 USD cash.  I took the conversion.  No taxes withheld on cash payment.  What is the impact to my ACB?  Do I recognize a capital gain at the time of the conversion or only when I sell the new common share?  The US Federal Income Tax notice determined that a U.S. shareholder of CCE will recognize the full amount of gain, if any, realized by such shareholder in the Merger. Consequently, a U.S. shareholder will recognize gain, but not loss, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the fair market value of the CCEP Shares and the amount of Cash Consideration received, over (ii) such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the CCE Common Stock exchanged therefor.  Does this US Federal Income Tax ruling impact me as a Canadian?  Any guidance is much appreciated.  Thanks, Cam

0,"In industrial and real estate markets, there are apparent disconnects between the positive assessment of economic prospects reflected in market valuations and prices, on the one hand, and forecasts for the real economy and actual job market rewards on the other hand.  Um, no kidding, OECD.  Dig a little deeper, it goes like this:  Step 1. Vacuum up billions and billions of dollars of overseas money to buy up property after property in your major cities.  Step 2. Permit the real estate activity, just mentioned, to convert your economy into a real-estate addicted casino economy, where your major industries suddenly become real estate sales, old house demolition, and new house construction, with a bit for hotels and restaurants to service the rich buyers visiting from overseas.  That's it, it is that simple. The result, predictably, consists of a market that is disconnected from local wages and from local job markets, and that is addicted to millionaire money arriving from offshore.

The French have woken up to the fact that because of this the best of their produce is not available to them. It's happening in Canada as we speak.  Canada needs a policy on maintaining  enough good farmland to feed the country not just now but for the foreseeable future. And that farmland should be kept in the hands of Canadian citizens.

You have described an analogy in two bookends I have interpreted this as Mercy cannot be codified and there in lies the problem you cannot separate love of God and His law from love of neighbour as to love (Be obedient to) His law (Will) is to love ones neighbour.

Of course, Hackman guns him down and, afterwards, makes a speech to the townfolk who quiver in fear - """"All I hear from you, you spineless cowards, is how poor you are; how you can't afford my taxes.

0,"Denise has a point about saddling young people with a criminal record. If stopping that was part of the motive for legalization, it doesn't make sense for criminal penalties to remain. By comparison, underage drinking only nets you a ticket, even if they catch you with fifty beers.  As for the public health angle… can we just forget about the **** children for once? Underage kids who want weed can already get it: I don't see legalization making a big difference to accessibility.  And those of legal age are adults who should be responsible for their own actions. Give them the facts, then let them decide. We should resist this contemporary political trend to infantilize young adults. There are many ways to mess up with poor life choices, but once you set a precedent for state intervention, there's inevitably more pressure to ratchet it upward to cover other """"addictive"""" behaviour in the general population.

You’ll be great again because I’m great!” Trump shows little understanding of how democratic institutions actually work and he demonstrates no inclination to work within them. Of course he’s a fascist.  However, although Trump is a fascist, the United States in 2016 is not Germany in the 1930s.  Our institutions are stronger, our democracy more secure.  I think the United States would survive a Trump presidency, but given Trump's utter contempt for our system and institutions of government, his presidency would constitute the most serious test of constitutional government since the Civil War.

Without immigration, developers would be building one or two houses at a time and doing replacement and renovations instead of 20, 50, 200 and 1000 unit projects.  Their interests are in mass immigration, not balanced levels.  Media corporations are almost completely dependent on the size of their local market.  How many papers does the Toronto Star sell in Tokyo, Brisbane or Oslo?   Big splashy New Home sections produce far more revenue than a few pages of Bob's Home Reno ads.

This is how I read it.  Regardless of the differential tax rates and the fact that an employee by very definition does not employ anyone, neither can he write off all kinds of employment/business expenses that a business can write off. Yes, the small business owner usually risks his own capital... that what it means to own/run a business and if it is successful then it usually provides a much better return than employment.

There's clearly an issue here with radicalization within that community that we don't see with Sikhism, Buddhism, Shintoism or Hinduism, but we most definitely DO see with Islam.  Why does that community see this radicalization far more often than other immigrant communities? Why is it so tenacious that it survives years of inculcation into western society?

Now if there are questionable registrants, investigators can search the Internet very efficiently.  Even if people are registered in others states, a search will reveal this.  This is public record so the long arm of the law can visit after the  election.  The fact that voter fraud is very isolated proves that our elections are for the most part better run than those in the 19th century and appear very clean. Still, we need to make sure the rolls are properly purged of people who move or die.

Their view on abortion is deemed to be more important than the civil rights of Americans, the freedom of Women to make choices and deep poverty of so many Americans.  Buchan is someone that I disagree with, as believe that he is a fundamentalist and some one who should make suggestions about Theocratic governance.  We had that under the Nats, European Kings and Queens and Imperial Colonialism.  I ask the question - on form of Christian Government would Buchan like to see?

0,"well, I would live too. assume a family, no kids, makes 125K. to simplify things we will assume no other deductions. under the current tax system they will receive $12700 STD deduct + $4050x2 personal deduct. their adj income then is about $104K. their tax obligation would be about $19,400.  under the new proposed plan, the std deduct is $24K with no personal deduct, that brings their adj income to about $101K, under the new plan their tax obligation is about $13,500. that's roughly a 30% reduction. now this is simplified and I have left out a lot of the math, but that is the differences between the current taxes and the proposed taxes for the average middle class family.  this difference is realized within the monetary brackets of the particular tax rates.  if you want I can post the math or you can just do it yourself.

Even so, we need to be resolute during the negotiations and prepared to endure such pain rather that submit to an inequitable treaty.

0,"You are 100% wrong here.  First the relationship between Blackberry and the RCMP was totally over blown.  In most cases the access involved criminal investigation with court orders.  Blackberry did what was right and what ALL phone companies do, which is cooperate with police.  Next that issue has NOTHING to do with their enterprise products.  All enterprise products are such that the users create their own encryption keys and Blackberry has no idea what they are.  No one can break Blackberry's encryption, including Blackberry.  Police can get into Iphones and Androids but they needed Blackberry's help to get into their phones.  So actually you are better off having blackberry encrypted data as no one can hack into it, any other phone they can.  However if you are a horrible criminal maybe you should take your chances with an iphone.

Women have a tendency to KEEP UP with religious studies [check out the balance of genders in parish bible study classes], and in graduate school,  courses leading to advanced degrees of theology, church history, the history of theology, and  spirituality----have more female students in them than male students.   It has nothing to do with clericalism.  It has to do with selecting the best person for the ministry.  Considering the fact that in many dioceses,  the bishops brought priests over from India, Africa and the Philippines [sadly many are difficult to understand---and many are confused with what is demanded of them from their pastors and parishioners], having clear-speaking women delivering the homilies would be a breath of fresh air.

0,"I do not refer only to taxes.  The contract with America was about government reducing government functions and costs, and increasing transparency. It was not about ensuring that the government worked equally well for everyone.  I'm not sure I agree about the income/wealth gap growing more under democrats than republicans, and that is a long discussion. It was assumed that the Reaganomics tax cuts would benefit everyone through """"trickle-down"""" effects, which should have told everyone all they needed to know about the plan. At the same Reagan was building up the military and spending more on government than his predecessors. The gross national debt rose from $900 billion to $3 trillion between 1980 and 1989, a debt that became the responsibility of middle class and working poor American taxpayers. As Gerry Spence stated about Reaganomics, """"the benefits trickled down, but the miseries were shared by the buckets full.""""  Thanks for your thoughtful and respectful response. I appreciate it.

There would certainly be a huge outcry about bargaining in bad faith which might make him pause to think.  RC, for all his lunacy seems unwilling to act unilaterally. A lackey must write him a letter recommending a course of action (as with Sessions and Comey). He will probably look to the US trade rep to recommend pulling out of NAFTA.  The Lighthizer would like to get a deal by the end of the year but would probably not recommend opting out of NAFTA if this milestone is missed. There are a lot of moving parts to this deal. Many, including as I recall, commenters on both sides think negotiations could be protracted.  I think we are safe till next spring now that the process has begun. By early next year RC's personal problems should be sorted out one way or another.

This is echoed article 1 section 11 of the Alaskan constitution, and requires the opportunity to  question the witness against them in open court. The confrontation right is generally only waived if the defendant did something to procure the unavailability of the witness, which does not appear to be the case here. So let us presume that the state takes the case to trial. Her statement to law enforcement that she was raped would not likely be admissible. If she had his DNA in her, this information would be admissible. However, all he would have to do is take the stand and say it was consensual. Thestate would have no way to rebut this testimony.

In their initial zeal, and expecting an early '2nd coming', everyone sold all their goods and property and turned everything over to 'the church' (Apostles) to distribute according to need.  Even 'Christian Communism' did not work!  First result, the Apostles got in over their heads trying to distribute goods fairly. And soon there was a famine, and the Jerusalem community had to get bailed out by that collection St. Paul took up from his Gentile communities.  Real solution happened when people started keeping their property and caring for their own widows and learned to save up and plan ahead  for the long haul!

"
0,"Sorry, but this article is terribly flawed First, Jon mentions withholding taxes. Those are almost irrelevant. Jon goes on to correctly focus on the 46% marginal tax, that is what will be the ultimate taxes paid when trued up at tax return time. Focus on the 46%, forget the withholding tax (except yes the cash needs to be there).  If you take $5000 out you need to account for 46% tax so it should be only 2700 left to grow and be taxed at 50%.  The article at one point correctly mentions that the tax man contributed 46% of the RRSP. So, the correct thinking is a 46% tax on withdrawal is just the tax man taking back his 46% share of """"your"""" RRSP. He was a partner all along. Your 56% share grew tax free!!  The article states the RRSP is merely a tax deferral. Absolutely false. Your 54% share grows completely tax free if marginal tax rate unchanged at 46%.  Notions of freeing money from RRSP to save taxes are mostly utter nonsense. The proper math and thinking will lead you to let it grow.

The poor are getting poorer, he claims. The inequalities between rich and poor are worse than ever, he says. Pollution is making us sicker than ever, he implies. And the basic requirements for sustaining human life are becoming more inaccessible than ever.  These claims serve a purpose: to illustrate that the rise of industrialization and market economies (a modern phenomenon) are the cause of these social and environmental ills.  But does MSW realize this?

The tragedies are so rare, tens out of tens of -millions- of children, as to be notable by that rarity.  Firearms barely register on the list of accidental or deliberate causes of death and injury.  Obviously gun safety is a critical topic and, like sex ed, probably should be taught in a non-political way at age-appropriate levels in schools. That would buttress the existing and ongoing trend of decreasing rates of accidental death and injury.  Sadly, in many of these cases the firearm is not owned by a lawful possessor, like the cases involving a gun hidden at a mother's home by a non-resident criminal boyfriend, without her knowledge. There is little any education campaign or legislation can do in those situations.

A study by the anti-defamation league revealed that there were at least 372 murders committed by domestic extremists between 2007 and 2016.  Of that number, a whopping 74 percent were committed by right-wing extremists, 24 percent by muslim extremists and about 2 percent by left-wing extremists.  Is that clear enough for you?

The Catholic Church would continue to exist in those people, however few they may be, who remained faithful to the orthodox teaching. Pope Benedict foretold that the Church would lose its influence and its numbers in the world as its members continue to surrender to the hedonistic secularism which has displaced  christianity in Western culture. Protestants claim in the creeds to believe in the Holy, Catholic Church but of course we know that they delude themselves. In the same way those Catholics who reject the Law of God today, although they may think of themselves as Catholics would be outside the Church.

The academic standards are subject to less rigor and certainty, based on my experience as a student.  They more closely match with the rest of societies' concept of 'sucking up'.  To get a good 'grade' one is required to parrot the information nearest and dearest to the heart of the instructors involved.  I am given to understand that there is also a thing known as 'grade inflation' which is a corollary of the Lake Woebegone Principle that 'everyone is above average'.

As some psychiatrists have noted in the study of sexual offenders, a pattern of behavior that goes unchecked or undiscovered will likely lead to a lifetime of abusive behavior, but early notification, diagnosis, treatment, especially in the young has a very high rate of success.

We want Canadian citizenship to be revocable when people obtain it fraudulently, for example. Furthermore, by treaty Canada cannot render a person stateless. Canada could only, in theory, revoke citizenship of a dual national. That too might be an option we would want to retain, in the unlikely event that Canada went to war with the citizen's other homeland.  While acknowledging the abuses of the last century, I don't see how they could be repeated today. From the legal standpoint there seems little to be gained by making citizenship a constitutional right.

Stories of cannibalism are told. The Blackfeet were the most feared tribe on the plains, and they regularly terrorized their neighbors. The Black Hills changed hands between tribes warring on each other many times. You got a problem with the American Indian Movement? http://aimovement.org My point is that Indians were being killed and displaced from their land by other Indians long before whites arrived. We just had better weapons to do it. As soon as they could tribes like the Blackfeet acquired guns to make their own wars on other tribes easier and killing other Indians more efficient. The whites diseases killed more than wars however.

You are right that people who leveraged questionable financial instruments to fund a lifestyle they couldn’t afford are partially culpable.  But regulation of the financial industry is partly to guard against malfeasance by investment bankers, and partly to protect those who haven’t sufficient sense to protect themselves.  This is why we have laws against usury.  If the business community has more knowledge and ability they certainly haven’t shown it.  They architected the last financial crisis through greed, and I believe we can expect more of the same now that Trump will be relaxing the few controls in place.

You might find it interesting to know that in South Korea, there are no products on the shelves of a grocery store, only images and buttons.  The shopper presses the buttons for the products desired, and when checking out the products are already bagged and tagged.  This is the result of having our monetary system of intrinsic value -- gold and silver coin -- stolen from us in 1934 and 1964 respectively.  For the first 100 years of our nation's existence workers were paid in wealth, not I.O.U.'s for the national debt, and it was reported in 1900 that the living standard of the average working man, woman, and child improved during that time more than it had in the previous 25 centuries.

That's a concept so stupid even Donald Trump would hesitate to say it !  Now I went and read the stories your stories are about - and your sources are flat out lying about the contents of those stories. What they DID say - is something that no sane person could fail to realize as an absolutely obvious truth. That Trump's victory, and the WAY in which he won, angered a great many people on the left, and one of them went to far, I effectively said the same thing in my response to you !  The man was an extremist who did a terrible thing and was rightly condemned for it. But now deal with the fact that this is far more common on the right. The FBI considers rightwing extremists the single greatest terror threat to American lives. Leftwing crazies exist, but WE don't bloody hail them as heroes !

0,"The primary fault with the Affordable Care Act from a cost effectiveness standpoint (aside from not being a true single payer system) is that States were allowed to opt out of the Medicaid expansion. This leaves the rest of the country and the Federal government covering the healthcare costs of the uninsured populations of those States and dilutes the shared risk that would reduce costs for purchased plans. And it's no secret that the States who opted out score the lowest on healthcare outcomes and are invariably """"red.""""

0,"SkeptiCat, On your first assumption about my point, you're not quite correct. More accurately my point would be that we seem to be heading down a path about which we know very little or nothing. So if no research has been done, or at least some theorizing, then we have no idea about whether we're heading from one tipping point to another. We seem to be galloping toward """"green"""". But is there a point of balance between the phasing out of fossil fuels and phasing in of """"green"""" energy technology that would serve the purpose of preserving the Earth, provide our energy needs, and let us pause to assess? Research in this area, perhaps using the same sort of computer models as are used in predicting atmospheric warming, could be used and is necessary. As to cutting the world's population, if we do so voluntarily, assuming we can get agreement and action (really big IF), it will take a couple of generations. If Mother Nature assumes that task, about 2 years, maybe less, is my guess.

Further in the private sector one can opt for less or more service, at less or more cost.  So let the taxpayer pay for those who can’t pay - sort of like welfare, and let the rest buy their own health care. The load on the taxpayer would be reduced by approximately 83%!! There no doubt will be some who will object to paying for the 17% but the overall savings are so great that they should be able to accept it. Down from 100% to say 20%. Health care in the private sector just like all our goods and services.

McKenzie (now Sutton’s prison is no longer needed and is shuttered); the road, sewer and power projects that were built to support the prison built out there in the wilderness; an expensive, seldom-used, Pt.

(google images). The two shared many common political goals, such as a separation of the races, which even Muhammad Ali spoke to publicly as a Muslim, as far as mixing races in marriage, etc.. We today would see that as racist, but America loved Mr. Ali, even if he held such views. I didn't know they marched through the Bronx, so thanks for bringing that up, I am going to google that.

0,"I was reading some of Schumpeter's old papers a while back, at least I think it was him, and he looked at the business cycle in a more nuanced way than we currently do.  He broke down what we call the expansionary phase into two separate components: the recovery phase, and the prosperity phase, at least I think that's how he phrased it. The point is that expansion and growth occur from the trough to the peak, but we don't get to prosperity until we are past the recovery. That is, until real GDP has returned to and is exceeding it's long-term growth trajectory.  According to this view, we should be careful about curtailing fiscal stimulus during the recovery phase. It should maintain compatibility with, and complementary support to, monetary policy.  Given the goepolitical risks and uncertainties in global trade, our tenuous recovery is by no means assured. You are right to express caution at the current risks, but that does not mean we should abandon sound policy.

It would be unfair to tax them for this under the arguement that the government has made to date.  We are taxing people to pay for rich pensions many of which do not have pensions.

If they had prepared a more complete plan which they had seven years to construct then the CBO would have scored that. They didn't because the PPACA is their plan from way back in the Clinton days. The crap burger they submitted was thrown together so hastily and shoved out of the only two committees allowed to debate it so far that the CBO hasn't had time to fully vet the macroeconomic effects but that shoe will be dropping on their heads in the next few days.

The income is assumed taxed in the country of origin under current tax treaties with many countries. Then there are the wealthy immigrant investors still arriving via Quebec. It was documented by the government that these investors pay less income tax in Canada than refugees. It is also documented that there are tens of thousands of homes in Vancouver where residents claim less income tax than they spend on their high value housing.

But then so is a family that encourages such endeavors, and an intrinsic ethic of curiosity and a willingness to work to find answers.  But even accepting the need to take charge of our own education (throughout our lives), there is the great trap that is ideology. In my experience, by far the greatest determiner of the acceptance of the findings of climate science is political ideology, not scientific literacy. It's simply amazing how seemingly effective politics can be at making smart people really dumb.

0,"Hello Idon,  You are wrong with your claims about the foreigner tax, and you can see the proof of that visually at the graph posted below (non-partisan website tracking house prices).  In the first place, prices only dropped about 4 percent (look at the top right part of graph: the maximum downward slope is 8.5 percent a year, and that lasted only half a year).  And that is single family detached houses - you can see on the graph there was even less of a drop for other dwelling types.  You claim, without evidence, that the rapid swing back up was from Clark's introduction of exceptions. Your claim is laughable, as the time frame in question also corresponds to Quebec hitting records for bringing in investor immigrants (better part of ten thousand a year, the largest portion of whom buy in BC, studies show) and to the end of the spent-out flash of purchases in the weeks just before the tax, which when spent caused a temporary lull.  http://www.chpc.biz/vancouver-housing.html

That is a primary reason why you lost me as a supporter; so now I ask, what are you going to do about it?   Maybe it is time for a change of head office that is able to articulate a clear message.

And thanks to the Sequim bypass we all paid for, westbound travelers and out-of-town shoppers basically don't use Sequim's small street network.  By contrast, PA's businesses are smaller, more marginal, and already competing with Sequim's.  Those """"millions of visitors"""" mostly just drive through PA on their way to the West End, the Park, or Victoria.  This new sales tax will fall primarily on PA residents.

The Js are one of the better teams clustered here, but they will need to separate themselves from the pack.  Meanwhile, in the NL, one team that is not going to fall back is Colorado.

This then begs the question: how should teachers be managing their classrooms? We need to recognise that this is a considerable challenge, the success of which relies to a large degree on force of character of the teacher and administrative organisation (both on the part of the teacher and of the school). Unfortunately, many teachers simply do not have the required force of character, and many schools and/or teachers are not administratively effective enough to manitain a rigourous discipline system. Added to that, the balance of power in the school/parent relationship is very much with the parents, and should they choose not to cooperate there is little the school can do...

0,"First century Jewish women did not have the legal right to divorce their husbands, only the men had that right. In addition, women would not have custody of children unless her husband did not want custody. However, you are right that divorce would leave some women penniless unless she had family wealth. She could end up having to support herself by begging or prostitution. Marriage was strictly a business arrangement between families. I suspect Jesus' attitude toward divorce was intended to be a protective measure for women rather than an immutable demand that miserable people 2000 years later stay together. Fortunately the status of women in most nations has improved a bit since Jesus' time and most women can find a way to support herself and her children. This is often a far better choice than staying together """"for the children """" if that forces children to grow up in a home marked by rancor, bitterness, and emotional or physical abuse.

The local health department condemned the property due to the filthy living conditions, and that includes the areas Shirley occupied. The photos make it clear why that was necessary.  Shirley had almost two dozen dogs on the property that she hid between visits by the authorities. It was only because she hid the dogs (and had one put to sleep) that the police were not able to gather as much evidence as they would have liked. Again though, like I mentioned before, this really is more of a case of mental illness than criminality, in many ways. The photos make that clear, too. Unfortunately, the state only has the leverage it needs by prosecuting a criminal case. A welfare case is more tricky. The Maas family and the authorities did look into elder abuse charges against Shirley, however, due to her bullying against Maas, and Eddy died resenting Shirley, which says a lot.

What I am looking for is a solution that answers this question - how to move people on this island efficiently, timely and properly with an infrastructure that is designed for a population of 500 - 750,000 when the population of Oahu itself, by 2019 or so, will be one million people with approximately 850,000 registered cars, which will uptick as the population continues to increase. But to answer your question, my wife and I have one car, and I occasionally use public transit for, among other tasks, going to and from the airport. On the mainland, I use public transit all the time.

Fair enough.  But the rest of your post sounds silly and you need to explain:  What do you mean when you say Canadians are too """"WASP-like""""? What features or tendencies are you referencing?  Why do you lump Canadians together in one group? Are you unaware that some Canadians are NDP supporters and some are Marxists, and they have for years been making those criticisms about the corporations and the rich in Canada? Are you unaware that most Canadians did NOT vote for Justin Trudeau? Are you aware how ridiculously you are stereotyping what is actually a large and very diverse group?

0,"I'm covered by both the VA and Medicare; never used the Medicare.  But we put our daughter on an HSA until ObamaCare disqualified it.  An HSA isn't insurance.  It's a savings account to pay for """"routine maintenance.""""  It has to be coupled with a separate catastrophic major medical policy with a large deductible - typically $10,000, but you can raise the deductible to lower your premiums as your HSA account builds up - to cover the large, unanticipated and catastrophic, but rare claims.  Before Obamacare came along, they were cheap.  Most HSA administrators allow the money to be invested in mutual funds or safer savings accounts, and issue you a debit card.  I'd add a credit card to cover the deductible if you have a large claim before you've had a chance to build up your HSA, which works like an IRA if you don't spend the money by staying healthy and not running up unnecessary costs.  Most of us don't run up $3,000/yr in costs every year.  Rand Paul's plan lets you put in more.

The Bank of Canada doesn’t even state after a meeting which members of the Governing Council had voted to move the overnight rate up, down or keep it unchanged. The C.D. Howe Institute’s Monetary Policy Council has meetings in advance of the interest rate announcements of the Bank of Canada. Minutes of these meetings aren’t published either, in the sense of detailed summaries of who said what as opposed to a general summary of the tenor of the debate. However, it is recorded how each member voted on interest rate changes for the given month and for a year ahead. Surely Canadians should also know how the Governing Council voted on changes in the overnight rate for the month in question.

It may not be what The Denver Post wants him to say. It may be that he says he is reviewing the pros and cons on whatever action he eventually takes. But he talks. He answers questions. - But it may be as simple as (1) Obama's deal is there. It's signed. One either likes it or doesn't. (2) Trump's position isn't. It's not signed. And it is hard to like or dislike something that isn't in black-and-white yet and may not be until Oct 13th. - It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a meal, and while it is still being cooked, having the waiter ask, """"How does it taste?"""" That's a bit premature. And so is The Denver Post.

The post in Juneau, for example, only exists as a central office for a handful of Troopers who provide law enforcement in dozens of small villages. Municipalities like Juneau and Anchorage have modest taxes in place to pay for services like a police department. The Mat-Su Borough doesn’t even have a sales tax, which is why residents in unincorporated areas outside Palmer, Wasilla, and Houston get a free ride from the state, despite living in the second most populous borough in the state. There are consequences to having a legislature that wants to cut its way out of a $4 billion deficit in a state with a $3 billion budget.

We come in, do our thing, and head for the door. I know this is generalization, but I have attended and belonged to a number of churches as a result of job transfers found the exceptions few and far between.  The places I have enjoyed attending, one of which I am currently attending, works intentionally at building a community before and after Mass. And then it continues throughout the week.  It is not merely social gatherings, although that is important, its about """"works"""". Study groups, mission groups, retreats,...all things that attempt to connect the Gospel to the life of the congregation.  When Church is seen as a mission and ministry, all generations want to belong and remain. The formation of priests must spend more time developing this within candidates.

It’s time the National Guard to start really guarding Alaskans instead of putting money into the Iron Dog.  National guardsmen could escort mushers between Ruby and Kaltag , on the North route, Ophir to Kaltag on the southern route.  By snowmobile with driver and a gunner.  Villagers would be warned ahead of time not to approach Iditarod teams.  If they did, they would be intercepted, given a warning to stop and fired upon if necessary.  Troops aren’t sent into Afghanistan with a sat phone and told to “call if you have a problem”.  They are protected.  Mushers should be protected from the Alaskan Taliban.

The LNG line will be built if/when market demand brings prices up - in the  meantime-waste no more $ on that Pipe Dream.

0,"Development of doctrine, Assumption, is very much alive and well, and continues as always. You question, therefore, is very cogent.  First, yes of course, Jesus is present in the Eucharist, and Jesus is God, and therefore the Eucharist is adorable.  Second, development of doctrine does not mean that every development is to be evaluated by the future as positive. As well as the Spirit guiding, the human element in development is very strong. Indeed the Evil One is very keen to get in on the act of development to lead us astray.  Given both of these, I would suggest that the Eucharist is preeminently sacred food as evidenced by the the manner in which it was introduced by Jesus. There are two reasons, IMHO, for today downplaying the Eucharist as an object of adoration: (1) it was introduced and served for a long time to displace frequent reception, and (2) emphatic adoration outside of mass is a uniquely Catholic practice. Eccumenism is a solid reason for down playing this practice.

The truth is that Trudeau would not have won a majority government if he was as brainless as his opponents made him out to be. You need to ask why the Conservatives and Harper were not smarter than Trudeau since they lost to him. Trudeau campaigned on the use of fiscal policy to stimulate growth and he was ahead of the curve on this idea with Trump now being elected and feted for using the same idea. Low interest rates have been proved to have no effect to stimulate growth since 2008.  Trudeau also skillfully used a carbon tax plan to make pipeline development politically viable while Harper used malicious tactics against the environmental side and thus achieved nothing to get oil to tidewater.

0,"I believe man-made global warming is a fact. However it doesn't help to proffer solutions that won't work. For example, shutting down Canadian fossil-fuels production, as a solution for global warming won't do anything to reduce global CO2 emissions or global warming because global demand for fossil fuels will remain the same no matter what we do re Canadian supply potential. Fossil fuels will be sourced somewhere else apart from Canada if Canada decides not to be a supplier.  So, shutting down our oil industry means we forego $billions in revenues and disappear hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs. The revenues and jobs are transferred elsewhere: Saudi Arabia, for example. The planet will still be getting warmer, however, because global emissions will not have changed.  The solution is demand-side not supply-side.

The idea is that morality is a question of the heart--in the Biblical sense, that the commandments are not mere rules: rigorism rejected.  The situation has substantially--inwardly--changed.  The authors have lost the sense of what acts are. By acts they are referring to the physical. This is anti-Biblical and also not in accord with the Church's authentic moral teaching. The Church rejects rigorism.

I am particularly interested in what might be learned by removing/examining  your brain.  There are scientists who maintain even the external appearance of a brain can reveal mental diseases or defects which manifest themselves in a person while living.  And of course, further dissection of the brain could reveal much.  The possibility of doing such an examination on a still living brain could well produce  even more valuable information.

The statistics show that your assertion was incorrect, that the steeper decline occurred in the late sixties and the seventies and became much gentler over the next four decades. The Mass attendance figures for the UK show a sharp decline during WWII followed by a sharp increase up to the mid sixties. After that the decline followed the same pattern as in the USA. As far as I am aware there has been no decline in the populations of either th UK or the USA since the war, the opposite in fact. As I said above my aim was solely to show that the greatest exodus from the Church occurred during the seventies which the statistics bear out.

The troubling part is that people do not realize there is no economical replacement for Fossil Fuels, Coal, Natural Gas.  Wind Turbines have turned into a disaster killing hundreds of thousands of birds some of which are protected. Solar Panels have proven not to be the answer. Until a proven alternative to Fossil Fuels comes along, we need to understand that the Oil & Gas Sector creates over 20% of Canada's GNP  accounting for over $160 Billion Dollars a year of Revenue to the Federal Government. This new Federal Carbon Tax will solve nothing except be a tax revenue grap by the Liberal party.

It raises interesting questions about who is determining the thresholds for determining test result outside ranges.   The labs?  The federal govt?  The provinces?  Who?   The B12 serum test is covered under health care and yet the range is dramatically different from the ranges used in Northern Europe and Japan, where the incidence of Alzheimer Disease is much lower.   The fact that the lower threshold in Canada is 138 ng/mL versus 500 ng/mL in Japan (not to mention ranges in Northern European countries) should raise big questions.  Alzheimer is just one piece of the picture.   B12 deficiency can be misdiagnosed as a wide range of diseases.   It is the most complex vitamin, and it has effects in all of the major systems in the body.   Deficiency triggers problems depending on genetic SNPs (snips or anomalies).

Also, most of the exports from the 2 pipelines will be going China as a displacement for coal and to support their massive increase in automobiles - they will get the oil from someone, Canada or middle eastern dictators.  In case nobody noticed, China is ratcheting up coal mining primarily to support new electricity generation BTW, Canada produces about 1.6% GHG equivalents, our total output is a measurement error compared to China.

This book, recently published by Kashtan Press, is a must addition to anyone's library of Canadian Military History.

0,"The Pope and his advisory council discuss the need to """"make it mandatory for Vatican ambassadors to consult with laypeople before making recommendations for possible new bishops in the Catholic Church.""""  This is important.  There needs to be not just some vague """"consult the laity and religious"""" but a structure that assures there is a forum in which to make their ideas are made known.  Perhaps how this is structured is another one of those things that needs to be set up by national bishops' conferences, so that differences in culture, education levels in the society, and what typically divides - such as tribal affiliations in Africa - are considered.  Our bishops need to have an accountability not just to the pope, but to the people they supposedly lead.  So, the structure that is created to involve lay/religious in decisions about the selection of bishops needs to also provide for an annual or biennial discussion and reporting of performance as seen through the eyes of the laity.

Alaska oil workers have made Alaska great and it is time to support them!  The credits are less then 1% of what the state got from oil companies in royalty.  I suggest you say thank you and support Alaska’s oil workers.  Stop the monopoly and rigged system that is killing the state and keeping Alaskan out of the business  In 1967 a near broke company called ARCO found Prudhoe Bay and saved Alaska from poverty and the state has lived free off of that discovery for 40 years!  Now the big three and uninformed short sighted people want to run out the small oil exploration companies operating on the Alaskan N.S., why?  You’re wrong for saying they are “financial a joke”!

The line about accepting the election results was the real tip: """"I'll keep you in suspense"""".  He now has a sort of test run of this concept on his facebook page.  He is no longer about politics or a serious run for the presidency, and probably never wanted to be president from the get go.  What he wanted was his own personal round the clock TV network that would compete with Fox, but in reality be just like """"O"""" TV.  Forget HRC, his real goal is to out do Oprah.

The people of Puerto Rico are suffering, and it took days of public shaming for someone in the White House to finally schedule a visit as Trump has made his racist attacks on athletes his main priority on Twitter.

0,"The opposition is making a mountain out of a mole hill, as usual. However, I think it is a bit of a stretch for the Liberals to call their fund raisers networking opportunities.  Our political party funding system has evolved to the point where parties must be in constant fundraising mode to survive. With each donor limited to $1,500 a year it takes lots of donors to build an election war chest as well as run ongoing political party operations.  We can blame Harper for creating this situation. He eliminated the allowance given by parliament to MP's which were put in place by Chrétien to end the era of large donations by businesses and wealthy individuals. That left it up to the parties to raise money from the electorate with strict limits on what each could donate.  If the Liberals have become adept at garnering donations this way maybe the other parties should take note and do the same thing rather than complaining about being outclassed by the Liberals.

And while at first glance it may seem strange that many Vancouver households claiming less than $16,000 a year in annual household income are using those services whilst also paying thousands in property taxes on their two million dollar homes, there is an explanation. Many homes in Vancouver contain parachute families, where the multi-millionaire dad works in China, earning millions that are not claimed as income in Canada. That is how they afford these fees.""""

For most white color workers, the raise would be less than $90 per month.  The increase in health benefit premiums is over $100 per month, depending of which plan is selected.  With other increases, most will be taking home less pay.

These weren’t acted on in this budget but the continued warnings from Morneau raise business anxieties. It would have been better to get all such measures implemented in the first budget, so the business community knew what kind of business environment they would have to operate in. And now the Trudeau government’s grossly irresponsible refugee policies are threatening to thicken the border between Canada and the US when the Trump regime inevitably responds.

In addition, the scale needs to start JUST ABOVE POVERTY.  Everybody that is not on gov support should pay. Yes, the low end should be 1% or something like that. Very small.

Bernie has not just done 'moderately well' as you note.  He's done much, much better.  Calling me """"you guys"""" - - I'm a registered Independent voter, Bernie's an Independent......and he is rich with several homes.  NOT the 'average' American.

0,"O.k., make ridiculous statements about this worst case study (Which is similar to what the CATO Institute said by the way.  Reading is a terrible thing not to do.) from the Project on Government Oversight (POGO): """"As it turned out, the private contractors cost more in 33 of those 35 jobs. On average, the service contracts paid private employees 83 percent more than the government would pay a federal employee doing the same job (and that’s even taking into account health care benefits, pensions, and so on).""""  So the trick is to find the jobs and services that actually are cost efficient to outsource.  That is what effective leaders and managers do.  There is no magic wand to wave to fix the debt crisis.  We need to begin now by continuously chipping away at what we can for the next few decades.  Here are two links to POGO to help you out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_On_Government_Oversight http://www.pogo.org/

And the opposite occurs when an elder loses interest and purpose, as I've seen in the last couple of years with my mother.  She's nearing 85, and has 'retired' (her words) from more than just cooking the Christmas dinner.  And it seems her mind is retiring with her, her memory is failing, and while she's very comfortable in her home, she's become passive and indifferent to most things.  It's very sad, but at the same time it almost seemed to be her own choice to let go.  All we can do is keep her as comfortable and happy as possible.

0,"In reggae music, cannabis is often referred to as """"the healing of the nation."""" People always seek altered states of consciousness; that is a fact. Marijuana provides an avenue for this that brings with it the absolute least amount of harm. Marijuana does not kill, and its use does not incite people to acts of senseless violence.  I absolutely cry for the bush communities when I heard arguments like """"why should we add to our troubles"""" re: having retail marijuana there. I literally weep for the failure of vision.  I honestly believe life in rural Alaska is, at best, daunting. I firmly believe that the healing, safe herb is exactly what is needed to pry Alaskan's fingers off the bottle. We have got to get the idea out of our heads that prohibition is possible or effective; it is neither. Where there is a will, there is always a way.

In fact, over the same time frame tens of thousands of Americans have been killed by gun violence committed domestically by American citizens so if you're looking to protect Americans...  In any case, the last terror attack to be inflicted on americans by immigrants recently was 911 and they were mostly Saudis (not on the list).

0,"The following is copied directly from the IARC Q & A on their monographs: """"What does the classification mean in terms of risk? The classification indicates the strength of the evidence that a substance or agent causes cancer. The Monographs Programme seeks to identify cancer hazards, meaning the potential for the exposure to cause cancer. However, it does not indicate the level of risk associated with exposure. The cancer risk associated with substances or agents assigned the same classification may be very different, depending on factors such as the type and extent of exposure and the strength of the effect of the agent."""" IARC is limited to assessing hazard only by their own rules. Which is the basis for much of the criticism of IARC.

His audience, maybe 2000, was rapt, and I heard no harassment from the crowd. He walked to his car along Spruce Street, with a couple of students, I happened to be fifty feet behind him with friends. He wasn't harassed, and Penn is pretty liberal. Of course, he was on object of scorn among the radical left, and the mainstream press didn't like him so well either.

If primary scheduling – which was eventually tossed aside in any case – was enough to defeat Sanders that’s a pretty sad commentary. Clinton was the establishment candidate. It’s no secret that Wasserman-Schultz favored Clinton over Sanders. The party’s establishment and apparatus were more supportive of her. We know that. That’s what it means to be the ‘establishment candidate’. But did she or the DNC do things that made it impossible for Sanders to win or even made it any harder for him to win? I see no evidence of that. And this article provides no evidence of that. If Brazile can produce such evidence, then it can be investigated. Until then, she's only selling books, trying to make a profit through standard marketing hype. Selling her own book. Hoping to boost her own profits. So far, it's hype. No real substance.

My life experience is one of light-triangulation; first love-light that sparked my life journey began in Iowa. The family incubator of love-experience awakens wisdom-search, and points toward religious community and service. Sense of family, community, whose pinnacle work is realized in priesthood, in total self-dedication to God’s Work, in and with The People, is vocation call to all.

How is Flannery like Weinandy? Notice that neither the CDF nor his superiors have taken any action?  Does that tell you something about the reality that most knowlegable folks saw his original suspension as invalid, based upon bias, and violated his natural rights - no hearings; no dialogue; etc. Some canon lawyers could make a case that the original CDF order was *unjust*.

Of course not.  That would take serious effort.  Even clowns can caricature and mock individuals.  It takes much more effort to formulate and propose programs for American benefit.

Your points do not have anything to do with one another, nor do they indicate any level of sexism. First, being pro-LGBTQ in no way makes someone sexist. You are welcome to believe all the boogeyman stories you want about how allowing people to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity will lead to swarms of sexual assault, but that doesn't mean anyone who disagrees with you is anti-women. Notice several other organizations took stands against the """"bathroom"""" bill (which did a lot more than ban people from bathrooms). Second, exactly zero major sports leagues in America are intergender, so bashing one executive for that is a bit silly. I think most people agree basketball is a sport that would extremely difficult for women and men to play in the same league, simply because men are bigger and stronger.

They hope Senate fixes things. Obama and the Dems exaggerated what Obamacare would do and when problems started in the markets, they (and insurers) either did not see or tried to hide developing problems. Insurers are to blame, but they did not get subsidies they are entitled due litigation under a provision inserted by a Republican (Marco Rubio). The insurance companies are part of the market screwup in underpricing to get customers but worried about the subsidies they were not getting and which they thought might be stopped by Trump or Republicans. Dems failed to do anything to fix this. Now bill is too favorable to insurers and preexisting conditions and drug coverage are near gone.

0,"What a comparison - the BC NDP are not advocating for a  state like Venezuela. Nor are the NDP saying anything about raising capital gains tax - that opinion was just filler from a random egghead. No one is going to rob anyone, let alone at gunpoint as you suggest.  The BC Liberals use a regressive tax system of fees in order to reduce income tax - they have been elected repeatedly on the mantra of low income tax. But taking revenue from fees instead of income tax keeps the poor poor and ensures the middle class struggle to make ends meet.  The idea is to add another, upper end, tax bracket to a fair an transparent income tax system  - just like the Liberals did over the last two years. Perhaps the most telling differences are: 1. The NDP have the guts to campaign on this but the Liberals snuck it in once they were in office. 2. The NDP intend to keep it in place instead of what the Liberals did - remove the tax during an election year.  Please vote - but please think first.

DNR would have never written the letter to Exxon unless Governor Walker demanded them to. September was Walkers deadline to have a financial partner or shut down the project.

0,"JSB1, you are incorrect.  Pet sitting in your home has always been legal and falls under the kennel licensing rule, with exemptions to allow for sitting in a home.  That has not changed. It is just that now if you sit 3 or less pets at one time, you are exempt. If you pet sit for someone with the animals in the owners home there is no licensing required and never has been. I agree with Nick Fisher's comments that now there are no standards to be met by the exempt sitters and that makes the current inspection laws harder to enforce. It is customer beware and take your chances.  The online pet sitting apps don't do in home inspections and pets have been killed in such situations. Not something I would want to chance with my pets.

0,"I am not so sure 'Islamophobia' is behind the 'populism' rising in Europe. Many migrants & refugees from theocratic nations grew up in societies where ONLY the Islamic religion is practised while all other forms of religion are considered to be apostasy, punishable by prison, even death. Such beliefs can create an indelible influence. After migrating or fleeing their homelands, many organize to insist host nations change to reflect the beliefs of their homeland. If migrants promote their values & beliefs, why shouldn't citizens in host nations assert their own? If you allow someone to enter your home, you don't expect them to rearrange the furniture, etc, throwing out what they don't like.  There is a slippery slope to such cultural relativism, especially where politicians see potential votes. President Erdogan eliminated evolutionary theory in schools to favour Islam. We do not use old religious texts to design machinery or medical procedures; old ideas cannot design a modern society.

Since the city wants to amend the Urban Renewal District, and divert up to $48 million AWAY from schools and city provided services, I expect the city manager to propose more property tax measures when the services (pools, Cahoots, libraries, ect.) are cut due to a depleted general fund.  Increased property taxes make housing more expensive for everybody, including low income renters. The city (mayor, city manager, and half of the council) do not care. Funding their pet projects in the downtown are more important than providing services, living-up to their stated goals of making housing more affordable (so they say), and honoring their 2010 promise of terminating the URD.

An interview is useful if people tell the truth, if they are not truthful the interview is useless because we have no way to fact check because Assad has all the records.

0,"Free markets simply represent economic realities. Supply and demand. At present three immigrants arrive in Vancouver for every generational entering the housing market. The immigrants arrive with more capital and can out-bid generationals for the available housing. What the City is proposing to do is force developers to provide generationals with subsidized rental accommodation. The developers do not absorb the cost of the subsidy, however. They simply add it to the cost of their non-subsidized units. In effect, those struggling to afford a home will now have to pay for their own entry into the market as well as someone else's rent. Great solution to 'affordability'.

0,"In your scenario, if white people were committing the crimes they were accused of they need to suffer the consequences of their choices. Making excuses for criminals is a big contributor to recidivism. Excuses for their poor choices does nothing towards helping them learn from their mistakes. Instead, it emboldens them to continue making the same mistakes over and over. . As far as the real world, we need to continue locking up criminals, we need to find ways to make prisons less costly and less desirable. We can start by disallowing family/friends to send in money for commissary. We could turn a prison into it's own mini-economy by allowing different types of work programs. A portion of the wages earned can go to housing costs, reparations etc. They could use a portion for setting them up for release and a portion for commissary. Something like this would help criminals take responsibility for their actions moving forward.

Yes walking/laying around drunk and defecating in public are criminal offences.  SB-91 calls out that getting caught stealing a car is not a violent offence thus no jail time is served.

However, if Naspers had been selling canned peaches and was funding the Nationalist Party as a quid pro quo in return for a lucrative government contract, would you still think it was OK? I would argue that that would be corruption, even if the beneficiaries on both sides were still traumatised and disadvantaged after a terrible atrocity, as the Boers were at that time, and as black people are today. But this deal wasn't canned peaches. This was the manipulation of minds. Propaganda. Even in the context of the day, it was a devil's deal.

She also had a malignant lesion on a rib and she now has “some small spots” in her thyroid gland.” Despite her positive attitude, the cancer is spreading and will only get worse. Yet, Mazie says she intends to run for reelection. If she does run and wins, which is almost 100% certain for a Democrat, it is highly unlikely that she will be able to fulfill her duties for another eight years, and will have to resign to take care of her health problems. When that occurs, the people of Hawaii will be denied the opportunity to vote to determine who her replacement will be because the Governor alone gets to decide. I believe Mazie should do what is best for the people by serving out her current term and not running for reelection so that the people get to decide her replacement instead of the Old Boy network.

0,"@steveketola No, the difference between the 1950s & the 1980s were that in the 80s both sides (USSR & USA) were speaking to each other (START & SALT treaties),  & neither was eager to push the button.  The actors on each side understood how vast the devastation would be if thousands of nuclear-tipped missiles were launched.  In the 1950s, I would say instead that people were more afraid of it actually happening, & were therefore trying to figure out how to survive.  I might have had a chance of dying in any 20-minute period in the 1980s, but it was a very, very small chance.  Why make preparations for a highly unlikely event?  People on the west coast don't just say when the big one (earthquake) hits, I'll just calmly die, they prepare as they know it is likely to happen & desire to survive.  As for the Greenham Common & similar groups, their stance was unilateral nuclear disarmament as the only strategy for survival.  I'm still here so they were wrong.  My contempt for them remains.

The 3rd alternative, which perhaps applies to you, is one believes in nothing except self promotion and will do and say whatever it takes to seize and keep power.  In this regard, I recall you arguing that Trudeau could do whatever he liked so long as he """"allowed"""" a vote in 2019.

0,"Il Duce Trump is merely the point man for the same traitors operating behind their wealth to install a fascist dictatorship in this nation originally revealed in 1933.  The American Liberty League was created by the richest families in the nation to join with Germany and Italy to establish fascism in all countries.  The League espoused rule by dictator to protect their wealthy interests to the detriment of democracy and Constitutional governing.  After the nation climbed out of the depression and won WWII through the lives of working people, the same cabal worked to install fascism through the Republican party in Congress.  The next major step was the assassinations of both Kennedys and Martin Luther King, Jr. to ensure Nixon's election began the process of dismantling all of the Depression and War era regulations.  The same cabal created the ALEC led by the Koch Family.  The government is now in ineffective gridlock to set the stage for establishing a Dictator.  Study the history.

This probably pushes my buttons because as a signmaker myself I know Jackson, or Dale Faulstich or a couple others out here could have done something nicer for less money, but did we really need to spend money on this when more urgent needs, such as drones for searches go unmet?

This communism """"ghost"""" from the 1960's seem to be resistant to disappear. It lingers inside young and naive individuals who wear Che Guevara's t-shirts, don't have a clue on what living in Cuba really is like, and, think of Castro as a """"remarkable leader"""". According to his naive statement about Castro's death, Mr. Trudeau seems to be part of this group (I wonder if he wore his Che Guevara t-shirt while writing it).  If this wasn't naive, then he should know that """"it's 2016"""".

It had NOTHING to do with Trump's infrastructure plans.  Like the Bear's in this article stated, the U.S. is only 7% of the world demand.  Yet analyst, commentators, & journalists continually mention Trump's infrastructure plan as the reason for the rally in base metal prices.

Just how far should public schools, struggling for funding, go in solving the emotional problems of severely disturbed children.

0,"No. What I would suggest is that they re-direct their protests and discontent at the primary cause of the current malaise that besets their society - their own leadership. Non-aboriginal Canadians provide significant resources to Canada's native people in the form of restitution for past injustice and in the form of a wide variety of other forms but it never seems to find it's way to the things that can bring positive change within the aboriginal community. The 'way things are' is not the fault of today's non-aboriginal Canadians and they are growing weary of listening to the litany of problems the aboriginal leadership and the government want to hang around their necks. There is also a growing level of frustration regarding the blind eye that is turned to the financial mismanagement prevents aboriginals from accessing the services the funds are intended for. Rather than concentrating on past injustices, they should be focusing on the reformation of their own communities.

Why would I, because there is no free parking, and I'd have to pay to ride the rail. It's easier to just drive to Pearl Ridge,Ala Moana, or even to Kapolei and find parking. Rather than try and find free parking, pay to ride the rail out to the Westside, then transfer to a bus to visit my family in Makakilo, and they don't even live near a bus stop.

Your comments about PP, Meals on Wheels, and other stuff are just Democrat/Left talking points.  However, Trump's """"moral conscience"""" is exactly what prompted the retaliation for Assad's use of chemical weapons to kill men, women, and children in his own country.  In fact, Trump simply enforced the red line drawn by Obama which Obama was too weak to enforce.   Perhaps this explains why you last paragraph shifted to comment on former President Obama.  Surely you know by now that it is not political correct to attack our first half-Black American president.   Thankfully, that era will not only pass; it has already passed.

What I was referring to is your assertion that police shootings of suspects, etc. have almost doubled given the subject of the article. If you want to change the subject and address all people who die as a result of contact with police, how many hundreds of thousands of people who have had contact with a police officer are still alive and what is the actual percentage of people among that number that actually died as a result of an officers poor training or mistakes? Do accidents happen? Are some officers poorly trained? Of course accidents happen and a very few officers are poorly trained. Tell me how every single officer in the country is going to be trained to cover every single eventuality? The video? A tragic incident but in no way characterizes the vast majority of police contact with the public.

I doubt we'll ever know, but I think the risk/benefit analysis here says that the real possiblity the drawn weapons saved lives more than balances the possiblity that having a slowed analysis of a video would have led to a death elsewhere.  If the police were convinced the shooter might shoot elsehwere (as well they might have been) it seems to me that following up on the video evidence of the obvious shooter could be done while other police officers were doing further analysis of the folks on the video with a gun out but no obvious connection to the shooting.  There were 100+ first responders on the scene, I'm sure they were able to assign more than a couple police officers to pursuing the suspect.

0,"Interesting, in reading some of the comments it would seem most are not aware that Catholic schools are part of the Alberta Act 1905 which is the legislation wherein Alberta became a province of Canada. Only the Alberta Government can elect to amend (eliminate) the provisions regarding Catholic schools.  As a side note, in two centers in Alberta the Catholic system is the public system with  Protestant Separate Schools as a compliment.  This system has worked well - the issue regarding the instruction of sex education will end up being one which accepts all people for who they are, not what they are.  This was the prevalent attitude when I formally taught in the Catholic system in Alberta.  As a side note, when I first applied to a Catholic school board, I was required to have a letter of reference from our Parish Priest.  This requirement has been pretty much replaced to any Priest/Pastor/Minister etc.  So the system is capable of accepting changes to reflect society

With a sales tax, the wealthy buy more things, so they pay more in tax, so it isn't as regressive as the author wants to make it seem. Finally, the state needs to quit paying PF dividends to residents before they tax anyone one cent.

No one """"gave"""" us anything. No one can """"give"""" back lands stolen and sold from under our feet.

Easy, eliminate the Police Commission and have Mayor appoint the Police Chief.  It worked before the commission was created and I don't remember problems when Dan Liu was Police Chief.  Liu was Chief from 1948 to 1969 and served under both Democrat and Republican mayors.   So lets dump the Police  Commission and let the Mayor appoint the Police Chief.  At least the taxpayers can get some accountability from an elected official, rather than a cabal of political insiders.

0,"Lela, it may or may not be a bad thing that """"some law-abiding citizen on that bridge didn't have a gun"""". The unbounded optimism of those who think arming more people is the answer to every terrorist event isn't warranted.  In the right hands, guns are very effective.  In the wrong ones, they can pose a greater danger.  Not all armed citizens will carry safely, respond appropriately under stress, be extremely accurate, or instantly identified by police, no matter what they think before something happens. We can't know how many might have been saved, how many bystanders killed by armed citizens trying to shoot the attackers, or how many bystanders and armed citizens killed by police shooting at armed citizens they mistook for terrorists.  It is good the terrorists had knives, not guns, or it would have been even worse.  If it were easier for British citizens to obtain and carry guns, wouldn't it be easier for terrorists to obtain and carry guns, too?

It, IMO, wouldn't be that difficult to do and would certainly make for interesting reading.  Like you and, I'm sure many others,  I've had letters which """"didn't make it"""" to hardcopy or internet publication and such a site would give us all the opportunity to have our ideas presented in such a forum.

Either Uber isn't as safe as its proponents claim or no background check can be 100% effective. I guess your answer, unspoken, is no Muslims allowed in ever! What do you do then about people like Paddock in Las Vegas or born in America converts who get radicalised? There is NO easy answer.

1,"Sad to see no mention of the move by biological males to take over female spaces that Fed law allows sex-segregated.  Men have now pushed ladies out of the ladies' room at Target and Starbucks, off the gold medal podium at the last Olympics, and out of the  running for sportswoman of the year.  Worse, people with penises are now demanding to be referred to as women without ever once having monthly cycles, bloated bellies, or swollen breasts.  As we watch women being regulated  to second-class status in order to make men feel better about themselves, it is shoes that have caught the public' eyes.  Shoes, not women.

0,"The bishop's job is not """"health care""""  It is instead souls in heaven.  The real questions are: Where are the bishops on personal responsibility, grace, and sin.  NCR would love to keep talking about temporal events and avoid supernatural realities, mainly because its authors aren't capable of writing about it, and talking about """"soul matters"""" doesn't generate the heat and clicks that NCR needs to keep its advertisers interested.  We need few articles that try to lower our sights to the mere temporal, rather than encouraging a more joyful and demanding way of life, one of """"converting"""" all temporal matters into aspects of the eternal.

In the meantime, perhaps the Globe could give an equal amount of space to Sarah Kendzior, who seems to have a much more focused take on what's actually going on in the US.

0,"The article makes a good point.    Services cost money.    Alaska has too small a population for there to be a bright line between """"municipal"""" services and """"state""""services, especially in Anchorage.    People should at least acknowledge that although some additional cuts can be made, we're probably down to 3-5% of the budget realistically and, in no case, more than 10% without devastating the economy.      It's time to accept that citizens are going to have to contribute to services like every other city in every other state, not just the local property owners.

0,"Yes, what goes up must come down.  Investigators should be able to determine whether the shot was fired from within the stadium or from outside based on the angle of the wound.  A flat trajectory angle would suggest it came from within the stadium and a high angle trajectory from outside.  If it came from inside the stadium, people sitting or standing around the shooter certainly would have heard the shot and would have reported it.  It most likely was fired from outside the stadium.

0,"Keep in mind that sexism is also shown by women.  I know women who still, in 2017, snicker at men who are secretaries, interior designers, hairstylists, and the like.  And many of the men in these positions are clearly masculine, heterosexual individuals.  A change in attitude needs to come from both men and women.

0,"I do not think we can slide into an effective posture for reversing climate change without very serious reductions in consumption. We are a materialist culture, whether capitalist, socialist, or what have you. Arresting materialism, and transforming the values that accompany it, are the challenges we have to address. We even have to find new ways of doing economics. The whole idea of economic growth needs to be contained within some other framework.

He might still call a good game, but his best years at the plate and catching, sorry, done.  This team is stuck with him for another 3 years @ $20 million per.  Albatross.  Tulowitzki, you can trade him, but you're gonna hafta eat some of it, and Your Js might be talked into that.  He also is earning $20 mill for the next few seasons.  Ouch.  Donaldson is also on the wrong side of 30, looks like he's got some problems with his legs, his season is already in question.  Shoulda initiated the re-build last season, but they were in it, so not gonna blame them for taking their shot.  But now, if the bad start continues, time to start unloading players and contracts, acquire prospects, re-tool.
"
0,"Years ago we used a product called """"Buhach"""" to repel mosquitoes from dogs if they got uncontrollably bad. It's a powder made from plants. You can sprinkle it on the dog and then take your hand and sort of whisk it down into the fur.  It works to keep bugs away from plants, too.  Put a little on top of your barrel stove or in a tin plate or jar lid with some paper and burn it to create a small smudge which repels mosquitoes. I guess it was the fore runner of our now famous """"Pic"""" bug coil.

For cash investment considerations, compare the sum of the maintenance, taxes and interest on the mortgage to the cost of rent.  The principal portion goes directly to equity.  Rents escalate over time.  Great path to old age poverty.
