0,"Hi, nelson.  You may be right about """"foreign money is now moving on to our smaller cities...""""  But a lot of other people are, too.  1. Frugal, middle-class immigrants.  BC's immigrant population is declining.  The newcomers are moving to the more affordable small-town prairies.  2. Canadian-born caucasian homeowners cashing out from the Lower Mainland are taking their new wealth and moving to places such as Abbotsford, Chilliwack, and--yeah--Kelowna, B.C. In the east end of the Fraser Valley--wow, the home construction on the slopes just outside of Hope is unreal--you rarely see an Asian face.

0,"Of course when referring to policy in the ME/NE/SWA and if it's working?  You mean the Obama policy, right?  As far as we know, Trump has left those policies in place for now.  Not because he doesn't have one of his own, but because of Dem footdragging in the Senate confirmation process, the full DOS complement of appointees is being slow walked.  All your examples were Obama failures.  Especially qaddafi.  I still wonder why he didn't promote himself from Colonel all those years, but I digress.  I just hope our President doesn't try the out-of-session appointment trick, but waiting until the end of the month for Congress to come back is frustrating.  Rep. Gabbard, for what it's worth, is speaking her mind and her thoughts outside of any influence from most in her party and is being both chastised and lauded.  Just how its always been w/ elected officials and the general public.  I wonder what she would have said if Wolf had asked her a question about Susan Rice.  THAT would be good!.

All day long we are, in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people.  ― C.S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory

0,"My guess is they will not say a word about the missing info. Here's my assumption as to how that ended up on the form originally: if your pet had a terrible accident or illness costing more in treatment than you can pay, and if they extended credit and you didn't pay and it went to collections, they need that info to send you to collections and/or report the debt to credit reporting agencies. Also, in the olden days when people wrote checks, if the check bounced and they needed to submit it to the local DA for collection and judgment, those are the 3 pieces of information get DA's office required to track you down.  Times have changed, but forms live forever. Even a Vet who opened their doors last week will get their intake form from an industry Web page.

0,"Firstly you need to establish a good working relationship with your financial advisor and secondly rates are negotiable participially if your portfolio is in the million plus range.   I paid .66% in fees last year and though it was quite reasonable for the service provided.   I am now 64 in getting into lower risk - mostly dividends and distributions - not sure if 8% return over 30 years is obtainable as other posters have pointed out - having invested since my mid 30's I have seen great returns and not so great returns ( only managed to lose 9% in the 2007 crash) and did reasonable well last year  16.94% - I would find in difficult to get the diverse investments I have in my portfolio working 50 hours a week.    With todays market pull back - I expect to see a further reduction of 5 to 10% over the near term due to the quick market run up since Trumps election.     Still would go with a proven advisor or a self directed approach, they have much more access to market information.

If so I don't support there should be any limits on any professional to speak openly and honestly.  Was that not the complaint the science community had against Mr. Harper, he was muzzling them.   So it's  not OK for a PM to do it but it's OK for a nursing association to limit what a nurse can say?  If indeed she was speaking alternative facts the situation is different.  Silence is a real problem.  No one in police dare breech the blue wall, no doctor wants to openly express that a colleague may have erred, even when that is the truth, and now nurses must present facts in a manner that the public cannot see what is going on.  Would it have been acceptable for this individual to write a letter of complaint to the institution and then post a copy of the letter on social media?  She should start a go fund me page!
"
0,"I don't see why it would be improper to give sacraments to those contemplating assisted suicide.  This is especially true if one does believe the sacraments give healing Grace.

It's not about affirming choice, it's about providing another source of healing.

0,"NFL owners are understandably squeamish about telling employees to not insult many of their fans.  But in part it's the owners' fault we have come to this.  People respond to INCENTIVES.  The NFL player contracts often include such PERFORMANCE incentives.  But the contracts have ZERO incentives for the players to be DIRECTLY concerned about fan attendance to games, and the size of the TV audience.  A sort of """"profit sharing"""" clause for a significant portion of their player compensation would cause players to rethink their enthusiasm for insulting millions of Americans and politicizing the games.  Yes, fan support INDIRECTLY affects player compensation over the years, but the typical player contract puts the team on the hook for paying the players even if the stands are empty.  Given the level of REAL education and brain-damaged intelligence of most contact sports players (cue the Lebron James """"uneducated"""" diatribe), currently most players clearly are incapable of connecting the dots.

You can try to explain that mommy and daddy do not have money to buy you a lunch, but that still doesn't get a lunch to the child.  One way, perhaps, is that if the parents are receiving assistance (EBT card), that some of their amount is automatically taken away and put back into the school or government fund to help offset the cost.

0,"The Democratic Party's problems go way beyond Hillary and Bernie, it's that they've moved so far to the left that they're in danger of permanently losing the middle.  Case in point - JFK said you shouldn't ask what your country can do for you, slashed taxes rates for the rich, instigated a coup against Obama's favorite Cuban dictator, and sent military advisers to help a struggling democracy in SE Asia.  Today, a president like that would be called a fascist, racist, war-mongering Hitler wannabe by your people.  Case in point 2 - there's a video floating around of Bill Clinton's 1995 State of the Union speech, where he says the exact same things about illegal immigration that Trump says today.  Back then, Democrats cheered.  Today, they organize protests and generally lose their minds.  If Democrats want to win again, they'd be advised to worry less about the Electoral College and more about what people outside the bubble think.

We regulate the use of cars and trucks to minimize misuse as well as the explosives that could go into the vehicle.

0,"It is accepted that a congressional-executive agreement method is a complete alternative to a treaty method: the president can seek approval of any agreement by joint resolution of both Houses of Congress instead of by a two-thirds vote of the Senate alone. Like a treaty, such an agreement is the law of the land, superseding inconsistent state laws as well as inconsistent provisions in earlier treaties, other international agreements, or acts of Congress. Search: Congressional-Executive Agreement.  However, scholars that have written on the subject actually like this system better than just a vote in the Senate as it brings in more debate and incorporates both houses.  However, in this case, the vote to approve was ratified by a 2/3rds vote 42-21 in the Senate, so the vote in the House became a moot subject.

0,"When I was growing up 60 or 70 years ago, nobody had health insurance ... didn't need it because medical care was inexpensive. (I'm not even sure there was such a thing as insurance back then.) You could go to the ER and have a cut stitched or a broken bone set and cast and it cost at most about $50. I went to college in 1960 and medical care for students was covered by the university at the campus hospital. Then I was in the Navy until 1970, and, of course, the base hospitals took care of us including two babies we had on base. Then when I got out of the Navy, insurance companies came on the scene and healthcare costs skyrocketed, as did insurance premiums. I had to get insurance for my family, and in just the first year it cost more for insurance premiums than what it had cost for medical services in the entire previous 28 years of my life. Isn't it obvious that the insurance industry is the culprit here? They're the middlemen who devour the money. We need to get them out of the way.

Part of that is due to the War on Poverty welfare program that incentivizes the #1 cause of poverty, single parenthood, which went from 17% in 1964 to over 70% now in the black community.  A single woman with a couple of kids can get the equivalent of about $60,000/yr of taxable income in Housing subsidies, EITC, SNAP, WIC, etc. with just a minimum wage part time job, and she can count her kids a dependents thru age 25.  It would be irrational for her to get a full time job that pays more unless it pays $60,000 more.  And here's the catch.  If her kids get a job and earn a reportable, taxable income, it can reduce her benefits.  The only way they can bring more income into the house without reducing mom's benefits is under the table, via crime.  Works fine 'til you get caught.

To make sure the media continues to give these incidents the daily attention ISIS and others think they deserve, the extent of the carnage increases.  On the other hand, if the media report only some of them, the extremists will only escalate the scope until the media does report them. Either way the violence will increase to attract and/or maintain the attention of the media.  On one hand all this violence is brought into our living rooms daily when there is nothing we can do about it. The other way the violence stays in the countries of origin.

A consequence of some of these developments is essentially a new class divide between the urban cosmopolitan elite often better sheltered or immune to these developments and the Rest.

If you're at least reading news from the Left and the Right (and alt-right), you'll know Puthuff has swallowed the twisted definition of """"fake news"""" generated by Breitbart and other online outlets. Realizing the stories about Fake News were true (generated by small, in-house operations, many from other countries) and largely consumed by Trump supporters, Bretbart redefined fake news to mean inaccuracies by the """"lamestream"""" media (that would be RG too). True, the main media outlets, producing tens of thousands of stories a year, got some things wrong.  But that was not the original definition of fake news. If someone attacks you for spreading lies, don't debate the accuracy of what you said, redefine the definition of lying and then attack your opponent with the same charge - but amplified. Those who are biased to confirm their beliefs will swallow the new definition and counter charge and you'll keep your supporters. Lies we can believe in.

0,"Your comment inspired me to dig up some comparative numbers (warning some data may be a few years old).  The University of Texas System has a $16.9 billion operating budget. Texas has a population of $25.1 million and 213,000 students in the system.  This works out to $673 per resident and a whopping $79,000 per student.  The UA system has an operating budget of $335 million. Alaska has a population of 737,000 and 34,000 students. This works out to $454 per resident and a miniscule $9,900 per student. Meanwhile the UA endowment is around $200 million ($271 per resident), while the UT endowment is $24.1 billion ($960 per resident).  The resident cost of attendance at UT is $26k/yr while the cost at UAA is $21k.  Given these numbers, I would conclude that UA has been extremely efficient with its comparatively small budget.  Moreover, I'd say the State of Alaska has been short-sighted in its relative lack of investment in the UA system.

Robinson Crusoe (Daniel Defoe, 1719) was the first English novel. 700 years after the Japanese novel.  Second, how is a literary tradition relevant to the question of Boyden's writing or that of Indigenous writers? Boyden has written one good book and several mediocre books. For that he became the darling of the CanLit crowd and the go-to guy on the subject of Indigenous culture. Indigenous writers - real Indigenous writers - continue to be ignored.

It would save the lives of the people dependent on poor quality street drugs. It would cut the crime and prostitution that finance their drug habits. It would bring addicted people into the medical system, so they would have access to treatment. It would take pressure off the police and ambulance services. It would cut the drug profits that fund gang violence. It would save the governments a lot of money.  Providing heroin legally to addicts would be a an enormous positive step that would benefit all of society.  Very successful pilot projects have proven that it can be done and that it works.  The Liberal Government should expand these projects with a view of eventually establishing a Canada wide system of access that is safe and that can help the people that need it.

Clearly there was no war of conquest in Canada.  That contradiction of highest laws guaranteed in 1982 Constitution Act and with Indian Act policies administered by fleeting elected sitting governments, has led to long drawn out legal battles. The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held Canada to its higher true and peaceful destiny with Indigenous Nations rather than siding with aggressive sitting governments bent on assimilation and termination policies.  Even today this Trudeau government seeks to avoid accountability to these higher laws and basic Canadian ideals in his petition to Quash the findings and instructions of the Canadian Human Right Tribunal. His government acts with belligerence while it is the children of Indigenous Nations that continue to do the dying.

That remains to be seen.  But virtually all of the individuals and organizations quoted in the article are opposed to the death penalty in all cases and in all instances, for a variety of reasons, and would be even in the cases where question of guilt is not an issue.  The intrinsic merits of the death penalty can be argued all day long, and reasonable people can disagree about its use.  But to argue that every jury and numerous courts of appeal up and down the line that hear the merits of every death penalty case are uniformly failing to administer justice without prejudice is spurious at best.   Such a argument loses luster when it is used in every single case, particularly as a last resort by those who are opposed to the death penalty in all situations.

Part of it, I think, revolves around gender constructs and """"what it means to be a man"""". Part of it might also be akin to what women used to experience: no one encouraged women to pursue STEM fields, so they didn't; no one encourages men to pursue caring roles, so they don't. We need to stop second-guessing the motives of men who become nurses, kindergarten teachers, support aides, daycare workers, etc.

Some is paid through public insurance (largely drug coverage for seniors), which in turn is financed through taxation. A big chunk is paid through private insurance, which insured citizens pay for in a variety of ways (and insurance companies make a profit from). So citizens pay 100% for their pharmaceuticals.  If F/P/T governments took over the business, citizens would not pay that little amount out of pocket, nothing would change for those who are already covered by public pharmaceuticals, and citizens would no longer pay private insurance companies. Presumably the money citizens pay for private insurance would be redirected toward taxes so that the gov't could pay for the drug coverage it would be providing.  What not split the $4.2 billion that gets saved.  Citizens get half and the gov't gets half.  Sure, may taxes are up, but if it's less than what I pay for private insurance, I'm in!

0,"Mr. Bilefield provides seemingly Random quotes from 19th century President McKinley, William Jennings Bryan (1893), humorist Will Rogers (1932) and, for good measure, he adds crude references from pop culture mediocrity Ed Asner and a politician from Britain’s southern hemisphere refuse pile.  Do we see a problem with Henry’s timeline?  Yes, McKinley and Bryan long predated the 16th Amendment (allowing the federal government to levy taxes on incomes of citizens of the states). The Will Rogers quote was uttered years before any of the unwieldy modern redistribution schemes had been enacted.  What is truly the definition of insanity is this blind faith in Washington to act as a benevolent arbiter of material wealth and social justice. It’s no coincidence that 7 of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are located in suburbs and exurbs surrounding D.C.

Bannon is describe as an economic nationalist. He knows as does Trump, this philosophy is where much of  the president's support is derived from. NAFTA and globalization in general have devastated many working people's lives. It didn't seem to mater who was in the Whitehouse their lives continued to get worse. They see President Trump as something different, A true change of direction.  This is the Liberals' challenge: Trump wont abandon his base support who are anti globalists and Trudeau's vision of Canada becoming the World's first post national state are opposite. The only thing they seem to have in common is a determination to make working people's lives better. I wish them Luck.

The anti-gun crowd doesn't push for a complete semi-auto ban because they are scared to alienate too many of their supporters.

0,"my statement regarding those two, who will be arrested for war crimes and tried in the Hague should they ever step outside of the USA, have been proven to be the most disastrous admin. in US history with their flippant devastation of our economy and deliberate kicking of the mid-East hornets nest for reasons they still cannot be truthful about while horrendously stooping to mass kidnapping and torture in desperate panic when their many lies were exposed..., stands as the turning point in kissing our national safety goodbye. the current admin. may be pathetic but there really is no legitimacy in pointing anywhere but at those that started the whole untenable mess. no W... no problems. no matter what this President tries or who takes over, there is no fixing the many woes Bush / Cheney wrought upon the world. the US economy has resoundingly rebounded during Obama's terms, that alone is worth ignoring the McConnellites and petty critics who purposely didn't help this country one tiny bit.

It's much more accurate to say that monarch populations have declined 43%. Mind you, I'm not saying that that's somehow """"acceptable"""", but at this point herbicide-tolerant crops have essentially reached saturation. If there is further habitat loss, it has to be due to some other factor.  It's also worth pointing out the opposite side of the issue. The adoption of herbicide-tolerant crops has reduced the use of tilling as a weed-control method. That, in turn, reduces erosion which can be extremely harmful to the environment.

If 'bump stocks' were, by rule, turning a semi-auto into a full auto weapon, the bump stock weapon would now come under the same requirements as owning a fully automatic weapon.  Now let me ask you, given the choice between buying a manufactured fully auto weapon or the same gun in semi-auto and having someone install and set it up with a 'bump stock' thereby making it for all practical purposes a fully auto weapon, which one do you buy?  Bear in mind, with the simple rule changes already suggested, you would for both guns now have to go through the same application process plus pay the $200 a year tax on each.  Further, with the MFG fully auto you can set the selector to single shot and still have good accuracy from 400 to 600 yds, whereas the gun with the 'bump stock' can only spray on full auto all the time and the best score we got from the one we had was 10 inches at 100 yards, shooting 5 rounds (far worse using a full banana clip)?

The Rust belt is old, white and went racist enough for Trump to win or so it appears. Demographic change is a slower process than the radicalization of racist Americans.

I went up to him as he was leaving his car, and asked for his ID, as I have had several experiences with being run down, usually while on my bike. He demurred... so I pointed out that it would be better if he just showed me his driver's license before I called the police... He said, """"I don't have to show you anything, you are a nobody.""""

That is ludicrous to even mention.  It is also ludicrous that one can purchase a modifiable semi-automatic rifle.  That will never make sense to me.  If we could only make that change it would be a good one as the true spirit of the 2nd Amendment would not be infringed, yet lunatics like this guy would be severely limited in their ability to cause mass casualties.

Legislators exploit an obscure section of IRS code and get """"reimbursed"""" for lodging and food at the federal per diem rate-regardless of expenses- rather than at the state per diem rate used by the governor and other state employees.  This federal overreach occurs during the regular session in Juneau, when legislators get $235/day for lodging and food. E.g. Rep. Reinbold paid $850 in rent plus $100 in utilities, a total of $950/month. Rep. Vasquez paid $650 in rent, plus $100 in utilities, a total of $750. Both legislators received about $235 per day, or $7,000 per month in """"reimbursement,"""" so each of them received over $6,000- tax free, per month during the legislative session above actual lodging expenses.   And Juneau legislators get 75% of the federal per diem rate, or $175 per day- $5,000 per session month- for living at home.  So smile when they take away your PFD to keep their lavish perks.

0,"I have no knowledge of the St Patrick's Day march pro life issue.  Since I'm Polish, St Patrick's day marches were never all that important to me.  It is my understanding that pro life groups were not included in the sponsors of the March, but not denied the right to March and did have a visible presence in Washington.  The march in my State did not have this issue.  And of course the March was anti Trump because Trump was the one who implied he had a right to grab women's genitals and women would take it.  Hence the cat eared pink hats.  Do pro life women agree with Trump's take on women, because otherwise I am at a loss as to why all the angst.  At least three of my pro life friends marched on Saturday.  I never ran into them because the March was way bigger than we expected.

0,"Surely you're not naive enough to fail to recognize that D's would do the exact same thing?  (In fact, they already did, just more subtly.)  As long as Obamacare remains in place, D's will NEVER accept anything more than nibbling at the edges to it, not substantial structural reform.  Just like that's all they allowed R's to affect on Obamacare (which, truth be told, were really just things to get moderate D's onboard).  D's would scream and demagogue to extract a few minor adjustments to the R plan and then all vote no anyway.  Just like happened 8 years ago in reverse.  The only chance of ending this stupid cycle is ending what started it to begin with.  Get Obamacare OUT OF THE WAY FIRST to hit the reset button, and THEN there might be a chance to develop a bipartisan plan.  But as long as Obamacare is in place, D's will NEVER support any significant change (other than their usual goal -- even more taxpayer funding thrown at it, of course).

Actually it poses no threat to the U.S. itself - can a few primitive unproven missiles threaten more than 10,000 advanced ICBMs with multiple warheads? What it threaten is the American empire overseas in Asia consisting of vassal states South Korea and Japan. The empire and U.S. global power, not South Korea or Japan themselves. Both SK and Japan 'belongs' to the U.S. - a source of great wealth, a source of debt finance, in exchange for protection service. Many including I call it a protection racket.  This is exactly what the NK development is designed to do. Test the protection racket. This is why Trump and others in the government huff an puff so loudly.  Trump and his gang surely love to hit NK and wipe it out, except they will also blow up SK, maybe Japan. This is due to the real threat from NK's massive conventional force. It is NK insurance for survival.

We need to also encourage local and national news media to work on good investigative reporting.  I am extremely disappointed in major news outlets such as CNN, NBC, (forget Fox) for their reporting on this campaign - all of them were fighting for media ratings rather than real reporting on issues and on the truth.  Maybe what our media have become is just an arm of the entertainment business, seeking to win the ratings battles by bringing the most entertainment to the viewer.  Biggest mistake was treating equal campaign coverage as giving equal time to the spin meisters on each side.  The facts were ignored.

They should go as the educational opportunities that the Iolani, Punahou, Kamehameha affords, cannot be matched by the public schools.  Public can offer the opportunity to all but cannot match the vast resources of the top private schools.  And that's why the leagues should be kept separate during league play and meet up in post season if the public schools decided to do so.  If it leads to the OIA having their own separate state championship then so be it.  I don't think it'll go that far as a thought floating is to bring back the Prep Bowl concept with OIA vs ILH champion forgoing the HHSAA tournament entirely.  The OIA goals does not include supporting the ILH league.  That's for them to deal with.

Again,  In the good old days, a Buds' skater like Ponie or Tonie or even the Great Sundancer  would have slapped or golfed that pass at Matthews, the time it would have taken Matthews to settle the puck down,  set up the shot  and  direct it at the net, the goalie would have been set --no goal, folks.

This way, Anchorage and most valley legislators are not compensated with a per diem during a special session; or wherever the session is held. Tuck's comment is childish at best. We need to save money whenever we can, and legislators from Juneau, living and working in Juneau, don't need per diem to cover costs associated with their service to constituents in Juneau. The issue of per diem should be administrative rather than political. It appears Tuck is more interested in a political fight versus doing the right thing.

That said, there are dishwashers available for the little glasses, and were this to become a catholic practice, it would now take long for some entrepreneur to manufacture one that washed many hundreds at once. The Lutherans, near me at least, consecrate the wine at the altar in a chalice, and then pour it into small glasses at communion. Chalices for this purpose have a small spout built into their top rims. Do you still object?  Unstarched purificators make it easier to wipe both the inside and outside of the chalice, which may increase hygiene. But since the organisms that spread infection are microscopic, there isn't a doctor anywhere who would describe better wiping as 100% hygienic.  Besides, it all about perception.

You have be to some kind of gullible drone to even imagine for a moment it's in your own best interests to have it ever become law.  There are many things wrong with a consumption tax,  ...but the real off-putting effect of the Fair Tax plan on wage earners that no booster will tell you about is it results in employers across the board lowering wages by 20%.

So is this guy good?  However, the concept or goal of this consultation is a good one.   We often hear partisans of the previous Govt brag about how Harper """"delivered"""" on his promises.   How?    He misnamed legislation and overused Omnibus legislation.    Eg: Was his """"Fair Elections Act"""" about """"Fair"""" elections?

To begin with, CNA staff in big cities tend to be racially segregated. In Queens, NY, the aides were Haitian and Jamaican. In LA, Mexican. In Seattle, Ethiopian and Somali. In these places, the CNA's barely spoke to the patients because their English was poor. Also, most CNA's worked two jobs, so they were always tired and short with the patients. They also had more, and heavier patients, to deal with. In other words, they'd be able to do their work well if they didn't have patients! Odd, huh? And I'm not being cynical, either. This I've noticed over my 30 years of nursing. Sad state of affairs. No wonder Americans don't line up to work in nursing homes. I've also found that administration and directors found them dispensable, too.  Be a CNA in my next life? Only if I was desperate.

This election will not bring us back to the glory days of the fifties, despite the political jingoism, but at least it woke citizens up from their somnolent march carrying worn out, unsustainable ideologies of the 20th century.

Before the US can withdraw, the negotiations have to collapse--and that's going to take a long while 'cuz these things can take years to negotiate.  Then he needs approval of Congress which is doubtful, or at least is going to take a long time to get those ducks in a row.  Trump's days in the job are numbered.  He might get impeached (improbable), or replaced as the Republican Party's nominee for 2020 (more probable).  Who knows, he might even decide not to run again on the rationalized basis that government has proven to be a waste of his valuable time.  In the meantime, NAFTA remains in force.  It doesn't have an expiry date.  If a mutually acceptable deal is possible, then great.  If one is not possible, Canada's strategy should be to play the long game and politely string out the negotiations for as long as possible.  In the meantime, it's status quo.

I recite again the experience of the audits in Portland and the fact that they have had little effect over the years except to sell news and produce sound bites for the next election.  But, Eugene voters continue to elect and re-elect the same people who are wasting their money, so maybe they just like the entertainment!

A few things from that: 1) That doesn't actually send a message to rest of NATO that they need to step up, because the U.S. isn't. It actually sends the exact opposite message. 2) The entire premise of the decades long military spending that we do, is to make the U.S. THE predominant military force on the planet. To maintain that...you don't want other countries increasing their military spending. 3) This is the essentially the NRA mentality on a global stage. More guns, tanks and bombs for everybody! If the entire world spent 3%+ of its GDP on military expenditures...we will have a lot more conflicts..not less. The global economy will contract because military spending provides no other economic benefit after its spent. Heck, if its actually used, it dramatically decreases economic output somewhere in the world (the place being bombed).

But they still may be able to do it, if they are all focused and playing defense well. Bigby-Williams will need to really up his game, but from the good minutes he played Saturday he may very well be able to do it. Brooks can certainly shoulder a big load, but the rest of the guys must play more like they played at the end of the Arizona game rather than how they played in the first half. I look for them to win their first two games, then hope they can pull one out with Louisville. Kansas may require something of a miracle. On the other hand, Kansas didn't win their league tournament either, in fact lost their first game. So they can be had at times. Make it happen, Ducks! And hold your practices in MKA with the crowd noise cranked so you are ready to bury threes from the opening tip in a big arena.  Go Ducks!

""""The Left needs to get to grips with its anti-Semitism, which it currently brushes off by insisting that criticising Israel (or """"anti-Zionism"""") is not the same thing as anti-Semitism.  The European Left has a disproportionate obsession with Israel: its default position is against Israel; its default sympathy is often with Israel's declared enemies. This unbalanced focus on Israel is itself an example of anti-Semitism. There are dozens of brutal dictatorships to choose from. Saudi Arabia. Iran. Islamic State. Russia. China. Eritrea. North Korea. Cuba. Yet the Left expends extra time and resources on its critiques of Israel, which is a democracy.  That just isn't fair, and that's why it looks like anti-Semitism. """"

0,"I don't think Assad is insane, but he is clearly brutal. Neither do I support the rebels. But the same condemnation falls on anyone who would use chemical weapons, be they Assad or the rebels. Assad is the one who has shown that he will use them anyway, and we have no way to assure that he disposed of all his chemical weapons or has not produced more. In fact, he has continued to use chlorine gas which is one of the components of the current atrocity, along with sarin. You seem to be getting your intelligence from the Russians who are clearly siding with Assad. We can't consider their intelligence as unbiased. Neither is American intelligence unbiased either, so we  have to use our knowledge of the actors involved and their past deeds. Can you tell me why Assad ever used chemical weapons in the past, knowing the world would condemn him? Assad may have wanted to test Trump to see if he would respond as weakly as Obama, especially since Assad has Putin backing him now. He got his answer.

As in, when the medieval Church started to model the liturgy on royal or courtly proceedings, was this an inspiration of the Holy Spirit? In both instances, there may have been sound human reasons: political, aesthetic ... but divine inspiration?  2. Because it is actually part of Church teaching that the Church needs constant reform. The particular application of this principle to the liturgy is in SC 21.

The navy needs a resupply/oil vessel now, not in another 10 years (The JSS fiasco has been ongoing for nearly 25 years).  Davie under new owners had the capacity to build, large graving dock, sufficient heavy lift cranes,etc (All of which seaspan needed BC money to help it upgrade)  This isn't an east, west, quebec thing. THis is a building capacity issue.  So long as the contract was transparent and canada negotiated a good contract with gates and penalties, sole sourcing it was the only option. Currently canada is renting a CHILEAN oil, yes we rent a resupply vessel from south america for our navy, that is how bad it is.

Like most people I thought Clinton would win the popular vote.  Unlike most people, however, I thought it was possible, because of Clinton's unpopularity, that there would be many more 3rd party voters, and that it was possible that Clinton would win the EC and Trump would win a plurality of the popular vote, and given the rhetoric from the Trump campaign about rigged elections, there might even be bloodshed.

How do you get a pre-literate people, i.e. a people without written language, whose culture was based on oral transmission only, widely scattered in small villages in remote areas, ready to adapt to the new conditions of a modern, industrial world economy?  There was no easy solution.  Governments everywhere in the developed world were experimenting with various theories and systems of mass education with their own illiterate peasantry and urban proletariat. Orphanages and private boarding schools were commonplace to educate large numbers of children away from their homes, to """"civilise"""" children through discipline, including physical discipline,  not unique inventions designed for First Nations """"genocide"""".

Well worth a read to better understand rather indulge in the current hysteria re the Khadr payout. If anyone should be paying it is the US government for their abandonment of the Geneva conventions, torture program, vengeful imprisonment, waging an illegal war, but they seem less and less able to accept responsibility for ANYTHING.

0,"But wait.  Americans mostly all believe that slavery is not so bad.  Around one percent of our entire population is locked in cages.  Just as in the days of black slavery, the many believe it is okay to deprive so many of liberty, lock them in cages, and control every aspect of their lives.  The Deady Hall issue is perpetrated by the media to distract from real issues of on-going slavery (disproportionately black) that exists right here today.  As with old style slavery, many justifications are given which the masses accept.  Even after we let these people out of cages, we label them as felons or sex-offenders and in so doing continue to control their lives as long as they live.  You think it okay?  So did the slave holders of the past.  I suggest cleaning up one's own house before carping about that of others.

0,"A short history lesson is in order.  In the run-up to the actual war, the southern states were angry that they were contributing most of the tax money taken in by the federal government in Washington, and weren't getting much in return. These states were breaking away from the U.S., and taking 75% of Washington's tax revenue base with them.  The Civil War - like pretty much ALL wars - was fought over MONEY. That is why, in the south, the Civil War was called """"The War Of Northern Aggression"""".

Next year the legislature can fix the broken oil and gas system so Alaskans can fill the Trans Alaska Pipeline and bring back the Cook Inlet's oil & gas greatness.  Texas increased its oil production by one million barrels of oil per day since Attorney Bill Walker became Governor because they elect their oil & gas commissioner and have a better system that prevents monopolies and provides reasonable permitting and bonding laws that allows competition.  Alaska is having trouble because the current system keeps oil & gas investors out of Alaska!  If the next Legislature does away with all tax credits and all taxes it will increase the state's royalty because investors will produce more oil and gas with a system that is not controlled by a few giant oil companies and a few bad paid off abusive people in power

Science Duck makes a good point that if Trump gives away intelligence that reveals too much about the operations of our allies, Russia will likely take advantage of that information, and our allies will become reluctant to share intelligence with our motor-mouth, boastful president. That is the consequence of betrayal of trust to an enemy, which Russia is. By the way, Russia now has naval hegemony in the Arctic Ocean.

In my lifetime 'mighty righty whitey' defined 'black' as ONE drop of black blood.  This is of course no more sensible than defining population groups by height.  My oldest granddaughter (via my daughter) is very obviously 'black'--phenotypically.  My second-to-youngest granddaughter (via my son) has pale skin, blond-brown hair and blue-gray eyes.  Yet 25% of both their genotypes come from me, and another 25% from their visibly 'black' grandmothers.  Throw in another 25% from a Fijian maternal grandmother for the lighter-skinned one.

Within walking distance was a beach, a nice trail around the bay and a terrific interpretive center.  There were trees separating camp spots, quiet and peaceful.  It was not on a weekend.  It was less than 1/4 full.  Then we went to Mt. Baker and found a (free) dispersed site along a river (with a bathroom close), with awesome views.  There were about 8 other spots along the river.

I don't think there is any doubt, either in the psychological community or among many observant people, (1) that we do sometimes deal with some unpleasant, traumatic experiences by suppressing them from active memory, and (2) that these now-forgotten memories cause unfortunate behaviours that we don't understand, and (3) that sometimes those suppressed memories flood back, often suddenly and explosively, into our consciousness, and (4) that sometimes we then recognize these repressed memories as the causes to the behaviour we previously did not understand.  Further, in psychoanalysis under the guidance of a therapist, such memories regularly first surface vaguely in symbolic form in our dreams; and then with time the underlying memories themselves emerge. In psychoanalytic theory, the idea is that we repress what we can't deal with, and our unconscious releases the memories when we are ready to dealt with them.

I guess there was a benefit for nuns in cars as well as for the City of Chicago, about which nuns chuckled that their habit's hems swept the sidewalks. Most habits are gone but sisters continue to minister in many places and many ways--with their law degrees, education degrees, science degrees, medical degrees, and much more. Women became religious wanted to serve; they did but also were required to live in a monastic-style existence and were hence at the edge of the laity's consciousness. Nowadays, sisters are JPFs---just plain folk--and free to intereact wherever and however, without worrying if the street is being swept by the hems of their skirts.

Canadians have be gouged and ripped off for too many decades by Canadian corporations exploiting their protected industries like Telecom, banking , finance, agriculture, commerce , dairy. The few super wealthy Canadian families and their heirs like Rogers, Westons, Sobeys, Pattisons etc. have been making fortunes off Canadians by colluding with Canadian Governments for too long to keep competition out. A lot of this wealth ends up untaxed and moved offshore to tax havens for these wealthy families. The fact that the CRA doesn't publicize any of the wealthy Canadians involved with the recent KMPG and Panama Papers offshore tax havens likely indicates many wealthy Canadian families and political figures are involved.

0,"If only Alberta was like everyone else....   Let me ask this, why should Alberta be like other provinces?  No group has figured out the magic solution.   Alberta had massive population growth which required a high level of public spending as infrastructure and services kept up.   That high need also led to questionable expenses and waste, no surprise.   Alberta had high priced oil/income growth to pay for all that.   Now that the income is gone, $billions sucked out of the economy in an instant, no surprise the equation is out of balance.   But the people are still there.   Many make a fraction of what they used to, if they are working.   Revenue has dramatically changed.   Their expectations also changed.  What has not adjusted is government spending.   Also not adjusted is some attitudes in the rest of Canada  - just keep sending money.   Why not challenge the implication that expenses aren't the problem?

Are women to give up all ambition everywhere that men of power attempt to coerce sexual favors in the workplace?  Or, do we work to change the rules of the game? Despite about 100 years of women's emancipation, it is still a man's world in how direct power and influence are created and used.  Men create the rules and the environment in which women are playing increasing roles outside the home.

The truth of the matter is that there wasn't ANY nearby military base that could have prevented an attack.  The nearest military base was an hour away.  Somebody made the decision to keep fighter jets grounded, but as investigative reports concluded, it was too late to send an air strike.  Benghazi was a recovery mission and not a rescue mission.

N""""C""""R seemed to be dozing during the Obama Administration, in which the recovery from the 2008 downturn was exceedingly sluggish, and annual growth was mediocre. That translates into far fewer jobs created than might have been, stagnant wages, and fewer opportunities, particularly for those in historically disadvantaged situations, such as young people and racial minorities.  Heard on NPR this morning, from a woman in coal country who voted for Trump: """"We just wanted to have someone there who wasn't our enemy.""""

0,"Beltrami, For starters the public employee labor contracts had for years annual wage increases far exceeding CPI. Despite your claim they are still getting step increases, so those in progression are still exceeding CPI. No sacrifices there!  Individual public employee health care contributions are well below those in the private sector.  The notion that public employees are unfairly paying for health care is nonsense. No sacrifices there! The implied assertion that 650 public employees were forced out of their jobs is more nonsense. Those were vacant positions, retirements, and resignations. If more reductions happen it will be in those categories. You identify two days of annual furlough as a sacrifice. Really?

I note that oil ticked up to $54 yesterday and at least one gas station I saw here in Ottawa today had jacked the price of regular up by 11c/litre!

They have been whining for 7 plus years now that they have a better health care plan, that was obviously BS and now they have a mentally unstable buffoon in the oval office that doesn't understand how to put a band aid on a cut, let alone health care. If and when the Republicans pass a health care plan, they will truly own it. What they have out there now is nothing more than a thinly veiled massive tax break for the ultra rich.

The achievements are those of African-Americans regardless of, and sometimes in spite of, their faith.

Gotcha.  As for the awards these marvelous wines win all the time, next time you're in your neighborhood LCBO store, take a closer look at a bottle of Barefoot wine.  It's likely the cheapest bottle of wine in the store, or close to it.  Any variety will do.  There's a little sticker above the label telling you about all of the awards they've won - more than any other winery.  It's actually decent, for the price, but no one is going to mistake it for a fine wine.  Still, if awards are what you're after, I've probably saved you a pile of dough.  You're welcome!  Oh, and I'm aware that Canadian wines are expensive, as you'll see if you re-read the post you responded to .  The problem is, they shouldn't be.  You will have no difficulty finding a better foreign wine for considerably less money.

They only care about them selves  and don't care in the least about those who's rates are sky rocketing.  Meanwhile the average guy is seeing his rates go up to the point he can no longer afford it . Trump and republicans could have done nothing so the democrats got the full blame they deserved for this mess--but instead they have tried to do the right thing and come up with a better plan. Again , you just don't get it . Obamacare was failing .  And what help are democrats offering--to stall things and hope the new plan fails . People will die under Obamacare . The only hope people have is if Trump's plan succeeds . For all the crying over the new plan---republicans should have sat back and done nothing.

Once one grasps the constancy of theological development in the past, the Tradition becomes a great friend, for it is the unassailable warrant for the changes we desperately need today.  Incidentally, in my view, it is not just historical depth in time but also historical breadth in geography (the Byzantine, Syrian, Egyptian Traditions) of the first millennium that warrant change. Since the Great Church (as come call it) of the first millennium was largely united, all the theologies of  all those culturally diverse Churches are fully valid today as markers in the past of what could be in the future. You may recall for example, that before the two recent synods, the wide range of possible solutions for remarried Catholics included the practice of the Byzantine Church. But for the numerical preponderance of JP2 priests, I think Francis would have taken us there.

As for the investigation, even though a long time has passed these are considered open criminal investigations, and there's all sorts of rules that are either directly enshrined in the law, or held in case law that have come from court decisions. The information is held so that investigators can maintain the integrity of the investigation, not alert potential suspects, not compromise witnesses or jurors etc. Also important is to prevent the possibility of falsely accusing or appearing to accuse the wrong person. While the internet crowd-sourcing answers is a great idea in theory, there is a real risk of it going awry and accusing innocent people, or just compromising an investigation.

The point is that this paper will never publish a critical or truthful store about what is happening at AMC because the SA gets too much money from GGP ads and other publications that depend on Ala Moana. They are not going to the bite the hand that feeds it. The reality is that the only success over the last 5 years at Ala Moana is Park Lane. This success has come at the expense of tenants and Foodland's departure a few years ago reflected that. In fact, this article failed to note the space Foodland now occupies was originally slated for WholeFoods but then the GGP bankruptcy in 2009 happened and whole foods pulled out. I bet this is the reason Foodland left back then -that GGP told them they preferred whole foods.

It comes instead from observations that a very disproportionately high level of terrorism is performed in the name of Islam and that majority-Muslim countries tend to have a great imbalance of rights for men vs women, straight vs gay, Muslim vs non-Muslim. In addition, the spread of Islam thru violent conquest since the time of Mohammed himself, while often similar to the spread of other religions in the past, is still advocated today by a vocal, murderous, & rather large group of folks in the name of Islam. In a free society, we must be able to discuss how to address such an influential and dangerous ideology (if held by a minority of Muslims or not) without the discussion being shouted down by accusations of Nazism and imminent holocaust.

You also claim that a greater number of the clientele who would frequent a cannabis club would then drive while impaired compared to bars. I suspect that could be true upon the clubs first getting started. However, as that industry matures and becomes more socially accepted, I don't see why the clubs would not have a fairly similar ratio. In fact, as a sober person I would much rather be around a bunch of stoners than a bunch of drunks, so my bias would be to expect more non-participants at the clubs over time.

0,"So here's the science behind global warming.  It's based on the """"greenhouse effect"""". A greenhouse stays warm inside despite outside temps because glass lets solar energy in but doesn't let infrared energy out as much. It retains heat. Carbon and some other gases in our atmosphere have the same effect: more of them in our atmosphere retains more of the sun's energy thereby raising the mean temperature.  This is basic science and well-understood. More carbon in atmosphere means more heat retention means higher temps.  The degree to which this is happening appears to be following projections.  The science is solid.  By the way, weather and climate are completely different things. Weather is what happens to be going on outside on a given day, climate is the big picture.

0,"Greg, we can quibble all day over how much BC's or I-732's carbon tax would affect fossil fuel consumption, but it is truly a minor point when you consider that according to the EPA's climate model, the permanent elimination of ALL of Washington State's greenhouse gas emissions would only reduce global warming by 0.00025 degrees C by the year 2100.  So even if you could achieve a 20% reduction (which I-732 would never do) you're only looking at 0.00005 degrees benefit by the end of the century.  Does that sound significant to you?  Yeah, me neither.  That's why I say I-732 is purely a feel-good, symbolic gesture which, as the AEI piece notes, would be all cost and no benefit.  http://www.aei.org/publication/washington-state-initiative-732-all-cost-no-benefit/

He is thrashing out randomly against a wide collection of domestic and foreign interests in a sophomoric fashion before he has assembled his administrative and advisory team he needs to help him prepare, prioritise, direct and manage the issues he wishes to raise.  Canada, in this context, should not rise to any bait but rather marshal its arguments and its allies in the US and abroad, rally Canadians to a united, moderate but steadfast stance and remain calm, constructive, unfazed and clear-headed in support of its legitimate interests and values. This makes us a dangerous target to be avoided and puts us in the best position to prevail if our interests or values are encroached upon.

They were clearly cast as the bad guys in the narrative and the author felt justified because Jerusalem was already destroyed. The truth is in Acts, both in how the-early Jesus movement considered itself part of Judaism and in how it was persecuted by the priests (not the people). When you translate the Bible it becomes real and can be analyzed using scriptural scholarship, which is why the Church resisted translating so that everyone could read it. Knowledge is power, and the power shifted when everyone owns the story. This issue was dealt with in L.G. It is the height of being a reactionary to oppose her on this.

We have great potential to be progressive, not regressive, by reforming BOTH the corporate income tax and the personal income tax. Until millionaires have a tax rate that is significantly higher than someone making $20,000 per year, a sales tax, or its evil twin, the gross revenue tax, makes no sense.  And as far as stability of tax revenue is concerned, all tax receipts will plunge when the next economic downturn occurs, including sales and gross receipts taxes. Stable tax revenue is a pipe dream, but is being hyped as a way to make the gross receipts tax seem more palatable.  No matter how they structure the gross receipts tax, it will pick winners and losers. They could have 20 tax rates (see Washington) and it would still tax some businesses more heavily than others.

The tax unfairness is that the working poor can be worse off than the nonworking poor, when there are means tests.

Because if young people, having seen through the empty lies and tricks of an anti-Christian secular dogma, and having been personally destroyed by them, turn to the Church and find it espousing that same miserable, demonic fraud, especially around matters of marriage, the family and human sexuality, they will run a mile from it, and possibly turn away from Christ completely to other faiths that do assert orthodox moral truths.

Friends introduced me to some of Ray Jardine's ideas, which became widely known from his 1991 book on the PCT, and the approaches of Roman Dial, who'd been testing such ideas out racing the Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic since 1982. Circa 1997 you might have been faced with improvising gear and gotten some funny looks - the big change since then is that now you can do it right off the shelf.

Retirement contribution typically 4% (most employers match up to 4%) Housing= $16,752 a year.Two-bedrooms carry an average rent of $1,396, which is $192 more expensive than the national average for a two-bedroom apartment. For a three-bedroom apartment you can expect to pay around the Colorado average rent of $1,744. Health Insurance= $10,000 for HDHP So remember additional costs for copay's based on Kaiser data.

Media that presents itself as 'hard news' has picked up on this and adopted much the same strategy, albeit with much of the explicit mocking muted. Unfortunately (for the administration, anyway) explicit mocking isn't usually required.  As a media relations strategy, reducing opportunities for mockery is probably a pretty safe bet.

Lower Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement is one large factor, but others exist too, including lack of affiliation with a larger system, poor contract negotiating leverage with essentially two insurance payers (Kaiser and HMSA), outlier employee costs, etc.  They all add up to a bottom line deeply in the red.     Consolidation in the hospital industry has been going on nationwide for at least 40 years with Hawaii hospitals the slowest to react to market realities.  Without an affiliation with a system, whether Kaiser or some other system, there are no good options.

Naturally, I disagree with them, since I think civilians should never be deliberately targeted, but obviously they don't care what I think.

0,"Here, in greater detail, is the conclusion of study in the journal Translational Psychiatry, which said that """"participation in youth football before age 12 increased the risk of problems with behavioral regulation, apathy and executive functioning by two-fold and increased the risk of clinically elevated depression scores by three-fold. The increased risk was independent of the total number of years the participants played football, the number of concussions they reported, or whether they played through high school, college or professionally. The researchers chose the cutoff of age 12 because the brain undergoes a key period of development and maturation between the years 10-12 in males. They examined other age cutoffs as well, though the age 12 cutoff led to the most robust findings. In addition, even when a specific age cutoff was not used, younger age of first exposure to football was associated with worse clinical function.""""

There are barely enough homeless count surveys done to determine a denominator, ergo it's unlikely any hard evidence exists. I speak from personal experience. Do you have statistic to back up your counter claim? Admit it by nature (die to the laws generally criminalizing homeless lifestyle) the majority of homeless people are criminals.  Where you live and what you do is entirely relevant as it speaks to the frame (or lack thereof) that you approach the topic with. I for one am not afraid to admit where I live, along the Chester creek trail system.

0,"You are quite right about the taxation challenges of the RRIF and I believe you are correct about considering a strategy on this front from an earlier age.  However, depending on your circumstances, this does not force you to defer cpp... but you must equally plan the tax impact of the entire stream of income in retirement.  We are fortunate and will slightly stagger the commencement of both retirement and the drawing of benefits to achieve the most tax effective stream.  I need to do the math but i think since my wife has better longevity genes, deferring her  CPP and taking mine early might be the most advantageous scenario.  Remember you have payed for CPP your entire life and are entitled to start it when you want. (until government changes the rules) .   If you die young (say at 69) you have given up any benefit of cpp and used up your own savings.  I personally would rather have a tax problem for my estate with larger inheritance.

In Canada you mention the word private and health care in the same sentence and people freak out while in the US you mention government and health care in the same sentence people freak out.  While European systems vary, there doesn't seem to be the same opposition to private health care as in Canada, but nor do they oppose greater government involvement either the way Americans do.  For primary care at least, Canada is the most socialistic, while US least so.  True health care in Europe overall is more public than Canada due to the fact it is much more comprehensive in its coverage such as largely covering prescription drugs.

If Saudi Arabia would accept only dollars for oil and invest the excess dollars in US securities we would provide military protection and keep Israel from attacking them.  The deal was made and soon all OPEC did the same.  Thus the dollar remained strong.  All countries had to convert their currency to dollars in order to buy oil from OPEC.  Today 60 percent of our dollars are in overseas accounts and the dollar is the leading world reserve currency, so we are told.  Otherwise our fiat monetary system could collapse sooner than later.  After all, $19 trillion dollars of debt is the most debt any nation has incurred, ever!  Only faith in the dollar keeps it from collapsing now.

In Thailand, foreigners cannot buy land but can buy condos, but only up to 49% per building. The United States does not restrict foreign housing, but keeps track and mortgages are difficult to get.

The Kenney scam combines a fiscally and planning incompetent PC party with a borderline racist and socially conservative one. If Kenney cons his way to the leadership then it will be WRA policies that prevail and that is precisely why the wording surrounding what the new party stands for is so vague - he couldn't sell the deal if he announced the Wildrose policies that he would like. Strangely, Jean is less WRA than Kenney is!

Tesla can't seem to make a profit selling very high priced cars, and I don't think that economies of scale are going to work for them with the Model 3.  The big car companies who have billions of cash flow and years of experience mass producing cars, realize that electric cars are expensive due to the cost of the batteries.  Of course GM, Toyota, Nissan, etc can build a car at a lower cost than Tesla as they already have a lot of engineering work to draw from.  Tesla is going to have to spend billions to get the Model 3 built, and they will have no wiggle room. Tesla is hoping that by building a massive battery factory, they can achieve economies of scale.  If it does not work out, there is no second chance.  I don't see them meeting production targets, nor be able to sell the Model 3 for the expected $35,000 price point.  Investors will run out of patience at some point.

A war to """"save the union"""" - i.e. one that had the US insist on holding slave states whose legislators had voted to secede from the US was one thing.  (Big deal!  They're still slave states in or out of the union.  So they leave the USA?Why should a non-American care?)  HOWEVER, A war to free the slaves and end slavery in North America (some thirty years after the British Empire did the same thing with legislation) was a aim of far broader and greater appeal.

Would we ask Andrew Scheer to denounce Mark Lepine, the white male terrorist responsible for the Ecole Polytechnique massacre? No of course not, that's absurd. However the white centric media's push to associate Mr. Singh with terrorist activities is telling and concerning. I'm not surprised. I'v noticed some older white Canadians are losing thier shit because we have a Sikh leading one of the three major political parties. Get used to it. I can't expect a very white, very male media to have some sence about how to cover Mr. Singh. It's going to be racist and stupid. However, decent Canadians, non racist Canadians, Canadians of colour will speak up and resist.  Jagmeet Singh is the new, very handsome face of Canada people. Get used to it. And I'm not going to respond to clueless racist commments about how the brown people are taking over. I said what I said.

Because... why, exactly? That sounds like a fever-dream rant.  Just slather on some rational thought with Occam's razor and you'll not only understand why Obama didn't want to sully the electoral process with meddling accusations but you'll also realize why your argument makes no sense from a practical standpoint. It's as silly as arguing that Kenya secretly bred Obama to be a Manchurian candidate, or that 3 million illegals voted and nobody was caught.

0,"The government has a report entitled """"REPATRIATION OF OMAR KHADR TO BE TRIED UNDER CANADIAN LAW"""", which states on page 112 that Omar is eligible to be tried for treason.  Why the government has not tried him, only they know.  There is plenty of evidence via videos and pictures, which were not obtained in Gitmo, therefore not tainted by torture allegations,  that could show his collusion and allegiance with Al Qaeda.  Its possible that Mr. Khadr built the IED that killed Canadian troops.  He should be brought up on charges of treason and tried in Canadian courts, if innocent then he'll be free.

0,"Lots to unpack here and I suspect what I have to say will open fresh avenues for a long and vigorous debate.  First, personal transportation.  I believe in mass transit and TOD – where people will be walking and biking much more.  Not just in Hawaii, but globally. Fortunately the planet’s population is fast urbanizing, moving into cities where such options work.  Already in Hawaii the number of young people obtaining driver’s licenses and cars is plummeting. Increasingly, short-haul trips will be through Uber-type services in electric vehicles.  I agree that the cost of solar cells doesn’t have much further to fall, I meant that price deflation will accelerate in other areas of generation and storage.  I’m not sure I understand the reference to land.  Increasingly power generation will be distributed, sited on homes and businesses.  Already one high-rise condo tower association in downtown Honolulu has decided to consider PV glazing when they replace their windows in 5 years time.

0,"Not quite the same, but MUCH closer than the meaningless '72%' figure that gets bandied about by those more interested in pushing an agenda than in being honest.  In reality women working full-time earn an average hourly wage of about 90% of what men working full-time earn (women working part-time earn more then men working part-time, but that is mainly because a higher proportion of the """"men"""" working part-time are 15-24 year old students).  The reason for this comes down to a LOT of factors including different types of jobs where one gender makes up a large share of the workforce than another and different levels of experience caused by women taking more time off to raise children and there being comparatively older women near the peak of their career earnings, usually somewhere around 50 to 55 years of age so they would have had to start working in the 1980's.  The gap exists, but it is often BADLY exaggerated.  It is also unclear what, if anything, the government CAN do about it.

0,"""""The attackers were people presumably brimming with the love of Christ"""" are digs at the righteousness of said Christians over the righteousness of others. Implied in the article, the righteousness of unbelievers is more righteous because their good deeds are done on the basis of being truly good-hearted and so on, rather than on the basis of (alleged) fear of a deity or looking good to others.  If you can't see how that's self-righteous grandstanding in itself, or the irony in Ivo writing this, then you might be deliberately ignoring it. At any rate, the point of Jesus' quote is not to point fingers at others but to look at yourself and realise *we all do this*.  Heck, there's a sense in which I'm doing it right now. We all put our righteousness in front of others - the article is a case in point.  Thanks for saying at least I sound intelligent :) As to Jesus dying, I'm merely pointing out that Ivo misses the point of it, not that he has to believe it just because I do.

Nonetheless, interest sensitive stocks like utilities & pipelines get hurt pretty badly at times.  The bear market in the spring/summer of 1998 was particularly tough on interest sensitive stocks that were index heavyweights at the time in Canada.  The stocks you listed I bet were hit hard back then.. If memory serves these were also hit hard in 2002.  While dividend paying stocks held up well during the bust of the tech bubble - even making money for a while - eventually that bear market also broadened to hit just about everything (approx Apr through Sep 2002).  If holding these kinds of companies lets you rest easily - great.  But there are tradeoffs in every decision and you need to understand what those are in each case.

0,"So many of these 'Financial Facelift' articles seem to involve people who are too lazy to make even a minimum effort to educate themselves about investing. I would bet that this couple knows at least something of what is necessary to maintain their house, their vehicles, even their own health, for pity's sake. Why is money and investing such a difficult subject to deal with?  When I started work 50 years ago I knew nothing about money or investing. There was no job security for me all those years ago and I quickly realized that I had to learn something about money if I were ever to make the most out of the income that I was earning. The learning curve was not all that daunting and I soon became fascinated with the subject of money and investing.  If this couple made even the tiniest effort to educate themselves they might surprise themselves and become interested about investing. It happened to me and I was a greasy-fingered oil patch tradesman.

None of them have to worry about training costs,  office leasing, purchase of equipment, etc, because the 'public' pays for everything including their sick days, vacation time, benefits packages and generous public pensions. When running a business, one has to consider all those costs, and vacations are not so common. When a business tries something new, it may fail.

Because their DEBT due to social programs has stopped investment in new projects that would expand the economy.  Instead of encouraging growth it attacks the producers and rewards the deadbeats.  Jamestown was the original Social experiment in this country and failed miserably.  Instead of producing to create growth we now borrow to pay the bills. If you ever pawned your tools to buy food you will know the results of this folly. WORK WORKS!!!!!

One doubts it.

Researchers at MIT recently reproducibly replicated photosynthesis at a level of efficiency equal to plants. These capture approximately 90% of the energy from the sun (that strikes them). Thermovoltaics would be another incredible source of year round energy in AK. We should be focusing our efforts on these and other similar methods. A great many countries are doing this quite successfully (and selling surplus to neighboring countries).  Keep clinging to fissile fuels, and we will just keep falling further behind. I would much rather lead. It make more economic sense.

There are criminal problems within our communities and many of our 1st/immigrants have the suscipion of police.

That is why unions got the vote out to defeat a labor law that would have fixed part of the problem and always elect liberals to the assembly and Berkowitz as mayor to keep the goods times in place .  Big fires are very few and far between . No fire is large enough that it can't be handled with perhaps 25 percent fewer fire fighters on staff year round .  As our states economy declines we need to make big cuts across the board .  Having dozens of fire fighters sitting around 24 / 7 doing little while waiting for the next call  is a luxury we no longer can afford .

I appreciate that you take the time to cut your own trail. However, I'm guessing it is on public land where we both may travel at will. If it were clearly marked as a trapping trail and there were alternative trails in the vicinity, I would most likely would choose a trail without traps. Even better, I would prefer to be able to look at a map before going out to see the locations of traps so I can be aware of them and minimize conflicts. Currently as a non-trapper, I have no recourse if I disagree with how or what traps are being placed on trails that I frequent other than to leave a note. Theft of traps is unfortunate, but it is difficult to argue that it out weights withholding information so that all user groups can make more informed decisions.

The fact we contract to do something forever and a day, does not change the fact the the sole authority for the contract is our mutual consent.  On the other hand, if we were bound by some other legitimate authority that we both accepted to permanently and perpetually refrain from incivility, than the authority binding us would be more that our mutual consent.

The fact is that the price tag keeps going up but the returns are not forthcoming.  We know that rail isn't going to bring us any real traffic relief.   For many who currently ride the bus, commutes will be longer with rail.   The jobs that were promised haven't materialized, and instead of affordable housing, we now have hoards of luxury condos in Kakaako.

The Trans Mountain pipeline currently moves 300,000 barrels per day. If you think there is excess capacity to provide the Lower Mainland with petroleum products you are either lying or grossly misinformed. I don't advocate threats and retaliatory moves but BC's threat to stop a federally approved project is a slap in the face to all citizens of  Alberta and Canadian confederation.

These are wealthy South Africans shipping their money out of South Africa, never to return. He says that in 2020 there will not be a tax base in this country. The Finance ministry knows this of course, explaining the latest laughable attempt to get income earned offshore by South Africans taxed in SA.

Whether or not he knows how to behave (trust me, he does), my daughter still needs to know that she has to take responsibility for her own safety by making smart choices. That is the only way for her to be truly safe. Your comment suggests that I can dispense with guiding my daughter and focus on guiding my son. I don't agree. I give them both lessons on how to behave considerately with others while protecting themselves.  Here is what I consider true victim-blaming: A person commits sexual assault and says it's the woman's fault for enticing him. What ISN'T victim blaming: people telling young women to be aware of the image they are projecting and don't put themselves in someone else's power and then trust he will not take advantage because it's risky.

Obama did save the auto industry and went thru hell and high water trying to convince them that he cared about them. I know quite a few white men that would never accept a female leader, much less a strong assertive woman. They have been hating Hillary for 30 years. Their wives stood by their men. Like the mother of a cop that may think the Black Lives Matter movement is a threat to their child, those Rust Belt mothers feared many things that might endanger their families, like the opiate epidemic in Appalachia that is effecting mainly rural white folks.  They feared Hillary didn't care about them because she cared about minorities. In their mind, caring when it comes to minorities in general and black folks in particular, is a zero sum game. Black folks gave Hillary well over 90% of their registered vote voters.

Unfortunately, congress doesn't get along well enough to do good by the working class and the ACA is failing on all fronts. Like I said earlier, if you think the ACA is great you either benefited from Medicaid expansion, or recieve federal assistance in the exchange. The numbers are not all that great, and in a few short years most states will not have exchanges because insurers will leave. Furthermore, the expanded Medicaid in our state will be gone in tens years as well. Once again, I would encourage you to read the commentary.

0,"A misleading article on several counts. 1. The cost of this house is significantly more than it seems. To rebuild it, since it is, as the writer points out, a tear-down, would cost 300/sq ft. Building on the island is significantly more expensive than on the mainland because of ferry fees,  the cost of bringing over heavy machinery, etc.. At the maximum allowable 1950 sq feet, the cost would be close to 600,000. Add on the cost of the house and the lease, and you are looking at close to 700,000. And, most significantly, you do not own the land which is usually half the cost of a house. And you cannot make a profit when you sell. So it is not an investment but then not everything is about money. 2. The """"archaic"""" system the writer refers to was essentially set up to be able to maintain a mixed-income community, saving it from developers and from becoming an exclusive enclave for the rich and keeping its welcoming character for the thousands of visitors that enjoy it daily.

0,"""""how did Europe make this transformation?"""" Europe had always been a literate culture, i.e.  from the Romans and Greeks, and after the Barbarian invasions, even when the masses were not, there were elites that were, monasteries, etc. The Bible in fact was the Holy Book on which European civilisation was built. Eventually with the invention of printing and the advent of Protestantism, literacy became something the ordinary person wanted, so they could read the Bible at least. So there were schools, and eventually free public education, including boarding schools. And those used physical discipline as a standard method of getting unruly boys to behave, children were sent to boarding schools, etc.  Not so a preliterate culture that had no idea what writing was or why they would want it, and had no history of literate elites or schools.  Read about the transition from oral to literate cultures and the wrenching dislocation that causes, everywhere, in the very way people see the world.

Since so many churches have to remain locked most of the week, but still involve maintenance costs (heating, etc.), maybe  it's something to consider.

Business have huge expenses because of California regulations. It 's graded worst than Hawaii in opening a business. Rent is very expensive which is why in some cities people employed full time are living in trailers and campers on the streets. Gas is very expensive because California requires nine different reformulations throughout the year. Gas is up to $1.50 cheaper in other states. And finally of course taxes are higher. It has been in Democrat control for years. It's no coincidence that four of the five highest tax states have been controlled by Democrats for years.

We have no debate about the need for """"Housing First"""" programs to assist them in securing safe shelter as a first step toward working their way out of homelessness.  However, that 6% is very much worth talking about.  It fact it's important, first, to point out that it IS 6% and those who cavalierly dismiss all homeless individuals as """"freeloading parasites"""" are very wrongheaded in doing so.  On the other hand, when you include those """"travelers"""" (that's the title very commonly used to refer to the voluntarily homeless) in the broad category of """"homeless and deserving our support"""", I feel you seriously weaken your case for such assistance.

Bush's TARP bill funded the stabilization of our financial and banking industries and Bush's loans to GM and Chrysler was sufficient to fund a chapter 11 bankruptcy. These actions took place BEFORE Obama took office. Trump rolling back many of Obama's regulations on businesses did more for the economy that all of that money Obama handed out to his campaign contributors. That is why the market started moving up the moment Trump won. Obama and his agenda was the main reason for the slowest and longest recovery since the great depression. The Trump administration has given the market a positive attitude and a reason to believe in the American Dream again. That is what Trump has done.

In neither case is there any video or audio recordings or credible witness accounts. Someone being told about something is in the legal world known as hearsay, not first hand knowledge, and inadmissible in a court of law. There is no credible evidence that the Clinton accusers were paid for their stories other than by tabloids or Paula Jones, who settled with Bill Clinton for $850,000. The questions being raised about Bill's activities deal solely with Hillary's actions with regard to the accusers, not Bill's actions alone or at all. I am not even a party to those concerns, just straighten out those who, like you, say that it is Bill's actions that Trump is responding to.

Alaskans already need a FEDERALLY issued ID to travel to the US by car.  So if Alaska continues to refuse to enroll in the Real ID program,  ANY ALASKAN who wants to leave the state will have to apply for a FEDERALLY issued ID.  What most people don't understand, states issuing Real ID drivers licenses will continue to issue their own unique licenses, maintain their own records, and determine who may access those records and under what circumstances.  But thanks to our Alaskan government, Alaskans will become dependent on Federally issued ID's to travel.  (And pay money to the Federal government to get them)  What a hoot!

Everyone is aware, to some degree, of sex offenders released into society with court-ordered treatment as well as probation or parole.  But are folks aware that once the sentence is completed, in two or five or ten years, offenders are free to go live where they want and do what they please (exception is those who must register for life) without community control or notification?  Research shows that those who engage in sex offender-specific treatment have a very low rate of recidivism, while those who do not are at high risk.  Are communities advocating loudly for such programs, or jut calling for locking all offenders up for life?  Does the CC provide good treatment and safe housing for its own offenders or turn them loose via dismissal from ministry?  We must start re-thinking how we as a society often contribute to the crisis by such failures in judgment.

You would need soldiers down range to feed windage, temperature, and humidity, data to the sniper (if you had soldiers that close why would you need a sniper 2 miles away anyway).  More importantly, as the velocity of the bullet decreases so does the bullets rotation which in turn decreases the stability in flight causing it to wobble along it's trajectory.  Even in a controlled environment with complete atmospheric data and a computer controlled mount setting elevation and windage, the simple inescapable physics of a bullet traveling that far makes it pure chance that you could hit a human size target.

HART objects that “people have to cross in front of the train” along with other false claims, such as a track taking two or three lanes, when it only takes one. The whole point of street level is that pedestrians can safely interact with the system, with lines that run right into the heart of our urban center, with easy boarding that encourages use.  It would do great things for our urban quality of life, as we have seen in increasing number of systems worldwide, without destroying the beauty of downtown. As one who opposed the elevated plan for decades, I see street level as the perfect compromise. It will save money, be finished sooner with less destruction, and provide a more useful system, while healing the civil war that HART has waged with our community, bringing peace to Honolulu.

I read it multiple times, and he states that """"many economists"""" believe the rate of return should be set to a """"risk-free"""" interest rate, one that """"might be in the neighborhood 5%"""". He does not identify an economist stating this, or explain how one can obtain 5% growth risk free (please tell me so I can put all my money there!).  In fact, Milliman, the PERS Board's actuary, is estimating  20-year annualized returns at 6.7%. If the assumed rate of return is lowered to this level, it would increase the unfunded liability by $6.4 billion, not great news but nowhere near what Sickinger reported.  The PERS Board should lower the assumed rate to the 6.7% recommended by Milliman, in one jump. No one can predict the future, but 6.7% is a conservative number according to multiple consultants, and puts a much more realistic value on the unfunded liability.

While I don't agree with him re: SISes and the shelter siting, I respect the heck out of him for not pandering and speaking out of both sides of his mouth to avoid revealing the truth about his views. I think he is a man of integrity and conviction, and I appreciate that very much. I hope that no matter what happens in this election he will stay involved at a local level and not just as a Democratic PCO. I think there's a place for Randy in the city-wide neighborhood leaders group, which is non-partisan.

1,"There should be rules about the quality of the food in the lunch, or ketchup will qualify as a vegetable again. Most of the regulations protect people from unscrupulous figures in power that will only care about their bottom line. For example, dumping waste in rivers saves the boss money, and hurts the community. Then everyone has to pay for the health issues developed. Therefore, in a case like that, much money would be saved by the taxpayer if the no dumping regulation is in place. Each rule must be carefully considered, and of course silly, nonsense regulations and rules should be cut. Think of the huge cost of Flint Michigan water situation because the unscrupulous politicians did not follow the rules to save a few bucks,  and had they put the proper chemical in the water supply when they switched the water source, billions would have been saved. Cutting rules and regulations indiscriminately is penny wise and pound foolish. This report is based on political ideology, not facts.

On the one hand, he is right - the beneficiaries of apartheid are also the landowners today, through inheritances, trusts and opportunities unavailable to the majority of the black population.  That The State is the largest landowner already is irrelevant. add to that the tribal trust lands, which probably pushes the % to near 60. Add present black-owned land to that, and land ownership, other than white, is clearly the largest by far.  On the other hand, it's the perception that counts, and the fact that the easiest political route is to threaten the status quo with nationalisation.  No black politician will start the process to disenfranchise the chiefs and entitle the occupiers of trust land. It's an obvious solution to the land issue, but will mean political suicide.  Another solution is to provide just land, and let people build their own dwellings, but this blunts the patronage tool....

Further, the TFSA is still a relatively small pool of capital meaning that even if I were inclined to sell stocks in my cash account I could only protect a small portion of the proceeds.  So again on a relative basis the TFSA does little to ease my mind about the potential for higher capital gains.  That isn't to say the TFSA isn't a good idea - it just doesn't provide the peace of mind that the column is suggesting - at least from the perspective of myself and likely most others who would be worried about higher capital gains tax.  Further, it is worth noting that just as there is the potential for capital gains tax changes there is always the potential for TFSA rule changes.

This facilitated tremendous growth  in Eagle River, Chugiak, Birchwood, Rabbit Creek neighborhoods, etc. but then the resultant traffic pretty much stops when it comes to midtown or downtown. From there a lot of it is distributed onto city streets that are not designed to take the traffic.  Anchorage residents have to pay more tax dollars as we pass road bonds to fix the city streets.

If families currently with private employer healthcare were to lose coverage for the same cost in premiums and taxes with Medicare-for-all, what level of coverage loss is acceptable in your opinion? And if those families desired to supplement their Medicare-for-all with additional private insurance (as many in single-payer countries do) that resulted in higher overall costs than currently is that acceptable in your opinion. Medicare-for-all sounds great but when you consider that rolling Medicaid recipients, private plans and possibly VA into the new system will result costs and coverage changes, the specifics should be stated honestly otherwise the solution is simply faith not facts.

0,"It definitely is for the children; educated children become effectively functioning adults.   School programs help supervise students when parents can't.  The more students need such programs, the more a district must spend on personnel, the more money is needed.  It does, however, seem like someone is always asking for more money.    Here's a thought: Parents could help by being present, more involved in their children's education, supported teachers instead of treating them like enemies. They might even save money on taxes.  Do you communicate with the teachers regularly?  Do you make sure (by seeing it), your child does his/her homework, before any fun activity?

0,"I was wished a happy holiday by someone. I told this person I'm Christian and that it's OK to wish me a Merry Christmas. This person knows I'm Catholic yet still didn't feel it was safe to wish me Merry Christmas.  I think it's more offensive to treat someone's holiday as a dirty word to be avoided via a euphemism than to accidentally wish someone the wrong holiday. I know someone Jewish who thinks all this PC stuff is way out of hand and is not the least it offended if someone wishes him Merry Christmas.  He will probably observe the day by going to a movie and Chinese food anyway, and is more concerned over an Islamic terror attack than being wished a Merry Christmas by a well-meaning person. I think this is keeping things in proper perspective.  In the United States, Christmas is a public holiday and people get the day off. Some people observe the secular aspect without any religious undertones. This is all a very first world problem.

0,"Suppose the arms, equipment, and oil companies who have profited directly from our latest military invasions and interventions paid the difference between US Army pay and private military company pay.  It's ten fold for the same risk; about $2,000 a month for the average US Army enlisted grunt versus $20,000 a month for a private contractor.  If we are to continue fighting corporate wars with American soldiers, why not expect the real beneficiaries to pick up some of the cost?! Many US veterans would be able to afford timely and high quality medical care after serving in combat zones had they been paid the same as private soldiers.  My opinion is admittedly biased by having served briefly in the US Army Infantry decades earlier.  And I didn't have a choice... I was drafted.

""""You shall provide unsustainably expensive medical insurance to your neighbors"""" is not.  Jesus told Christians to feed the poor and care for the sick PERSONALLY. He didn't say """"Hold a gun to your neighbor's head to force him to feed the poor and care for the sick on your behalf.""""  I am probably one of the most personally charitable people around, but I refuse to force my neighbors to give to my pet causes. I PERSONALLY owe God a moral duty to support and participate in the ministries He has laid on me to support and participate in, but that's because of a covenant between myself and God. I can't obligate anyone else to fulfill MY ministries. Other people may have ministries that are very different from mine and they need their income to fulfill their moral obligation to God's commands. Stop stealing from one another!

If their was a question I'm sure Ginsberg would have voted no.  But Chin, in his disingenuous manner, says the court is divided. He knows there will be no split decision.  Hawaii is becoming the laughing stock because of Chin's waste of State funds.  Initially he accomplished his goal of getting his face in the news.  Now those pictures are causing people to laugh. We have real problems in Hawaii which if are not corrected will lead us on the path of Illinois. We don't need to waste money money fighting windmills. The legislature continues to fund the the State by issuing bonds.  This overuse of bonds has led Illinois and Puerto Rico to where they are now.

0,"I'm going to go against the grain here. Twice we've had issues with water damage. Both times there was considerable cost to repair. Both times we were not home for an extended period of time because of vacation. However on the second disaster , and the worst, originally the insurance company denied the claim. The adjuster met with me and told me to resubmit the claim with a different context. Bingo, claim approved. Insurance companies are tough to deal with but intimately fair. Each major home policy we've done, the agent warned us about water damage being the volume claim. He was right. If you don't understand your policy, just ask. And don't try and cheat an insurance policy. I end up paying not you.

0,"That is simply wild speculation and insult with no basis in fact. This is my actual experience after 2 years and 60,000 km.  I paid $30,800 for a 2015 Nissan LEAF to replace a 15 year old BMW 323i.  I used to spend $60/week to fill up. Now I spend ~$30 per MONTH for electricity. So far, I've saved $6,000 in gas and $1,000 in regular service and repairs. Mostly because regenerative braking has doubled the life of my pads & rotors and no oil & filter changes.  I haven't lost any range although I do expect it will drop from ~130km to ~100km in the next 10 years. I haven't seen any evidence that batteries need to be replaced. Mine carries a 5yr/100,000km warranty. Most new EVs have 8yr/160,000km warranties.  I don't understand the hate for what is after all, just a car.

We do need a world-wide reopening of religious talk on Jesus engaging the world (incarnation) emerging from the world (resurrection) formed by the meeting of (unlimited) spirit and body towards the completion of creation. Let the institution role on, but, create an alternate sort of """"curia of the listening"""" - a ten-year mandated mission to listen to the world - observe, listen; invite those of good faith to talk, challenge and be challenged (by reality, fact, science, culture, tradition); teach civility in sacred spaces; teach and challenge to discernment; incorporate expertise; restore and appreciate the silenced and demeaned - aka those silenced by the John Paul/Benedict era; feed back/publish in terminology of the audiences; report openly (expecially highlights and rejections) .

Trump & Repubs should lead by example and live with the same austerity as Coolidge and our poor.  This nation has a serious revenue and wealth problem. We need the hard conversations on  how and where we spend the money and what to trim.   For example:  Do we spend on food for poor people or do we give tax cuts to the rich instead?  Do we spend on education or do we spend on a border wall and war?  Do we take away health care for millions in order to trickle up more money to the rich?  I don't think we should cut taxes-especially for the rich. In fact, I appreciate America and my lifestyle.  I am fine paying taxes for the social safety net, education, health care and everything that affects quality of life for all.

If rural conservative people want to be treated seriously, it would behoove them to get rid of the conservative social and religious planks of their platform and attitude.  There is a whole list of reasons why a kid from a small town won't go back to such places to live after HS and college.  These often include not being part of the """"right"""" clique, not playing the """"right"""" sport (or any sports) in HS, not attending the """"right"""" church, not having the """"right"""" sexual orientation, or not having the right set of beliefs.  Combine with little opportunity...why would he/she go back?  BTW-Trump won because 1) Hillary is a lousy campaigner, and 2) Trump promised things to people that sounded good but won't be delivered upon....but at least he talked to them.  Coal has been on the decline for decades.  Getting rid of regs won't change that.  Way more jobs have been lost to automation than to outsourcing (Trump products?) or illegals. That trend isn't going to change.

We're lucky these are small time miners, if the gold would sustain a corporate effort you know the fight to protect waterways would be tough.  Here's a place where liberal/conservative is just a lousy way to analyze the conflict.   It's hunters and fisherman, not generally liberal, that should feel most protective about waterways and the species those streams and rivers support.  While some liberals may denounce 'killing animals', the sportsman are deeply concerned about providing balance that would sustain their hobby.  And frankly, most LOVE the wilderness and that's where they prefer to spend their time.   Hunters provided tons of support for wetland protection in the Midwest for instance.    That's a big battle against corporate farmers, but one where hunters (gun owners), stood up for mother nature.sportsman

So far, their main purpose and accomplishment is to give generous tax breaks to the wealthy who are already able to attend the charter schools anyways.  The reduced public school funding then negatively impacts education for the poor and all others attending public schools, creating the downward spiral.

I had to return to C-SPAN to hear the speech.  My point is not to offer an opinion on the candidate or the speakers --- it is that many people have absolutely no trust in national media outlets.

The word substance was in use long before the West discovered Aristotle, e.g. in the Creed, 'consubstantial'. The word substance denoted what a thing really was, its essence. The Tridentine definition pointed left out the Aristotelian term 'accidents' and referred to these as 'species (appearances)'. Re para 3. Yes I agree the Old Testament contains revelation. I accept what the Church teaches concerning revelation (this requires a large dose of humility), that both Testaments are the Word of God in the sense that they convey the Will of God for mankind not necessarily always literally: in other words not as historical documents except in some cases when it is obvious such as Acts and St Paul's description of his travels. If I accept the Scriptures as the Word of God I cannot attribute error to them; God would surely not deceive us.

So continuing on probably was pretty much a waste of money.  Also, Khadr and his lawyers were actually after $20 million. So the government probably still had a bit of leverage at this point to bring the settlement down to $10 million, which would be less likely if they prolonged the case to the final judgement.  Of course keeping the legal case going would have allowed the government to put off this payment for some time, perhaps even to after the next election.

But, as the dark blue bar shows, it is very near the bottom for instructional salaries. However, it is middle of the pack again when combining instructional salaries and instructional benefits. This demonstrates that the benefits are higher than most. My impression is that the PERS charge gets accounted for under benefits, as it is part of contributing to the retirement plan.  If the high benefits cost is due to PERS, then a reasonable conclusion would be that right now we pay very little, comparatively, for instructional salaries, but with a typical benefits cost we could pay more and have middle of the pack results to go along with middle of the pack costs.

Its incomprehensible to me how canadians can allow this Govt to give away vital security technology just because Chinese proxies donated to the LPC in one form or the other.

0,"An important point is that physicians provide a great deal of medical infrustructure in Canada from their own pockets. They provide office space, run walk-in clinics, provide materials and services not otherwise available, as well as many jobs. If you cut their income, you will also cut into the provision of this infrustructure.  Furthermore, unlike other small businesses, physicians enter the workplace late in life with astronomical student debt.  How will they pay this off?  How will they save for retirement in this truncated work span?  It is quite likely that they may leave for more lucrative positions elsewhere in the world, and this is the last thing Canada needs.

The data they get to see is provided voluntarily by the executive branch upon request or upon issuance of subpoenas for documents or testimony the executive branch may be reluctant to provide.  There also is a thing call “executive privilege” which prevents members of congress from having access to various government records.

SS administration indicated they were looking into it.I personally have not seen any follow up reports. Not pointing fingers without proof but 20% of the Oregon electorate on disability is something to look into, like what per cent of that group joined the SSDI payroll in the last 5 years. Oregonians are pretty astute about government vulnerabilities and I wouldn't be surprised that some are in the group who jumped on SSDI when their unemployment ran out.

Plus...the planet is already burdened by too many people anyway.  Nonetheless enter religion giving a free reign to high birth rate in certain countries and cultures which are """"believed"""" - programmed - to """"take over the earth ."""" Poor earth.

0,"May it be that BHP management has an internal limit to 100 million USD due to the today's undecided future of the Jansen potash project? Look at BHP's Annual Report 2017 from September: """"Jansen is in the feasibility study phase and we continue to assess how we can reduce risk and unlock value. The current scope of work was 70 per cent complete at the end of FY2017. Work on the shafts will continue in FY2018. Once shaft excavation is complete, the shafts will be connected underground and shaft infrastructure will be installed. This falls within the current approved scope of work. Construction beyond the current scope of work will require Board approval.  With a later market window now anticipated, the Jansen Potash Project will not be brought to the Board in CY2018. In the meantime, we are considering multiple options to maximise the value of Jansen, including further improvements to capital efficiency, further optimisation of design and diluting our interest by bringing in a partner.""""

0,"Last I checked the Democrats weren't in control of the Presidency, Senate, or House. In fact, they have been frozen out of any participation at all. Nice try to deflect some of blame for all three of these entirely incompetent sets of Republicans. It's way past time to replace all three of them and we aren't even one year in yet. And no, I'm not a Democrat or any other partisan destroying this country in DC.

0,"Religious followers are supposed to model themselves on Jesus or Mohammed respectively.  Jesus was a humble carpenter who said to turn the other cheek, and submitted to being whipped, humiliated and killed, and never hit, let alone killed,  anyone.  Mohammed was a military leader and statesmen who fought, killed, and led great military victories, and that is what his followers admire in him.  Pretty big difference in role models.

0,"Peenutz, """"Why is that?""""   I am sure is a rhetorical question. But for the others, because the media are no longer journalists but advocates for their own point of view.  As biased as Fox is in one direction so are: MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post, NY Times, Huffington Post, CBS etc.; are in the other direction.   Viewers/Readers go to the source that supports their own viewpoint. btw G&M includes many articles from """"independent"""" writers and include the disclaimer """"the opinions expressed are those of the writer"""" However the vast majority of the time the opinions are those of the editorial board because G&M seldom has a writer supporting the opposite side.

0,"There you go!  He's praying! You proved my point. Probably asking forgiveness for himself  and forgiving his enemies. The Oval office isn't exactly the """"public square"""", look what Bill Clinton did there. I'm sure he had an expectation of privacy at the  time.  Trump prays and Bill plays
"
0,"""""that the JFA was slanted toward Clinton, and that the party gave her special treatment.""""  All obvious. The DNC sold its soul to Hillary while selling out its supporters, it's that simple. They'll probably blame the Russians for this as well.  Hillary had every card, and still lost, the DNC betrayed whatever principles it possessed letting her run the show. All of this lead to Trump being President. Instead of blaming others and Russians for Trump being President, they should look in the mirror.

As for Diversity....Leadership demands that you become aware of self, not as a black man (""""if you dont see me as a black man, then you dont see me at all"""") but as an individual first and foremost, connecting with what lies beneath your surface of conditioning and attaching the same value to all, regardless of race, gender etc.  Speak the truth from within you ...not from your outer circumstances.  Great opportunity here to draw the Nation together with a single unity of purpose...do more with the civil and church movements ... start drawing HZ in...refer to the surveys done by IRR...get rid of BEE and affirmative action and any other racist driven agendas.

Like the recent Senators piece, this is nothing more than a verbal chumming of the waters with catty little cheap shots and then he lets the comment section take over. I thought the statement 'looks 10 years older. His face is puffy; his hair patchy; his expression dull.' was a typical Kelly insight.
