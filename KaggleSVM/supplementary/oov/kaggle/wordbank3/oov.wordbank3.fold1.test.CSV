1,"KS, I prefer Dr. Schwab's interpretation of those bible verses to Ms. Bachmann's. I do not believe he ever claims that his opinions on biblical interpretations or political issues are anything except his opinions. In my observation, Trumpet lies more than any politician in memory. And, when he is proven to be a liar, he never apologizes or admits his lies. Merkel knows more about the EU than he knows about being a real estate mogul in my opinion.

He can't vouch for anyone but himself , and the fact he has proactively done these things listed in his response that show himself  to be a good citizen ,.. this was done be fore Dembowsky opened her pie hole or you had a clue...

0,"Perhaps the fact that these American political giants were humans, like the rest of us, is a shock to you? These men of great ability dedicated theirs lives to their country (some at great risk of being hung by the British if unsuccessful; two were assassinated while serving); the Robber Barons were just that. Giving away a pittance of ill-gotten gains at the end of their lives after decades of following business practices that treated their fellow men as so many animals may have fooled you, as was the intent. These """"great men"""" are the same as pigs in any country. Nothing unusual or laudatory in any of them. Replaceable. Some of our forefathers, however, were self-sacrificing men of vision who dedicated their lives to this nation. To its government. You may worship Vanderbilt and Morgan, if you wish. Obviously, our values are opposite.

0,"Quit believing made-up Liberal propaganda, and do some research, Gerard was in the Oval Office while Trump was signing papers in relation to China dumping steel. There was no statement against Canada at that time, and he did not """"endorse"""" anything.  As well, Mr Gerard is a Canadian, and supported Clinton during the election.

These nonprofits are supported by Federal, State funding sources and provide for support and administration of resources originally designed to improve the economic, health and social standing of members of the tribes and communities.  The major issue with these non profits is: they're outdated:  Communities w/populations over 500 do not benefit from the amount of contributions made on their behalf.   Compact and other funds are essentially diverted from these communities into ineffective non profits; the tribal non profits have established their own heirechy, mission and dependence on these financial resources to survive; the priorities of the communities the non profits are designed to assist become secondary to the non profit's own survival

0,"As a preface, I'm firmly in the free speech camp. His audience are adults, and if they truly find his statement offensive, they can change the channel or mute him.  That being said ... IF we're going to build a world where there's an offense-o-meter, and IF we're going to hold people responsible all over our modern society for their statements, and IF we're going to get into the odious business of forcing apologies, retractions, or possibly even pressuring people to step down or be dismissed, then it should be evenly applied.  If this kind of comment would get someone fired if the target were NOT Trump, then it should get someone fired if the target IS Trump. In my opinion, forcing equal results for equal statements is the single best way to create more free speech advocates. You only have to unfairly see your job toasted once before you'll rethink your participation in viral campaigns to get people fired.

0,"Like the FN disclosure act why do the unions not want to show both taxpayers and their members where their money is going? It is because union leadership are involved in some shady deals.  Mostly with political parties and so one has to wonder what's in this forth Trudeau and the LPC?  And why do they fear a secret ballot?  I think that the very public card system is where the real intimidation and bullying takes place by union goons.  Saying that an employer can intimidate an employee through a secret ballot is so laughable no thinking person can even take it seriously.  No matter because the right to work movement will make all this a moot point anyway.  The genie is out of the bottle in the US so Canada will have to adapt and allow it or there will be no unionized workers left anyway because these companies will move to the US to get away from them.

The benefits from just living and working in the United States are obvious compared to country of origin for most of these immigrants.

Schooled language, like, for example, the recent La Civilta' Vatican document that described cooperation between Catholics and Evangelicals as """"an ecumenism of hate""""?  I don't know ncr.   Your editorial seems quite one-sided and over the top.  Where was your compassion and understanding for the Knights of Columbus, or for those who respect the U.S.' immigration laws, or for voters for this president?   Over the last year, your publication has offered up a constant stream of heated pieces attacking Catholic and American conservatism, with no published counter-point essays whatsoever.  Given all that, I'm baffled how you can complain about a culture of Catholic intolerance.

0,"The America First movement, whose most notable member was Charles Lindbergh, clearly did not want to get into WWII.  I just discovered some other participants:  """"The AFC was established on September 4, 1940, by Yale Law School student R. Douglas Stuart, Jr. (heir to the Quaker Oats fortune), along with other students, including future President Gerald Ford, future Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver, and future U.S. Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart. Future President John F. Kennedy contributed $100, along with a note saying """"What you all are doing is vital."""" At its peak, America First claimed 800,000 dues-paying members in 450 chapters, located mostly in a 300-mile radius of Chicago.""""  I knew that Kennedy's father opposed Roosevelt's pre-1941 involvement in the War.  That's why he got fired as Ambassador to England.  The Greatest Generation, including Kennedy, found their way to War after Pearl Harbor, of course.

0,"Shem, I could not make the pro-UBI argument you made any better.  Well done!  I hope skeptics inclined to think such a future scenario is just a figment of your vivid imagination will feel free to say so, because I could then flood this discussion with the rapidly growing mountain of evidence suggesting tech change could eliminate existing jobs faster than it creates new jobs--or at least """"good"""" new jobs.  Such evidence is abundant and not difficult to find.  If no readers ask for this, anyone who is interested in the growing threat/opportunity of 21st-century """"technological unemployment""""--i. e. a near-future scenario (the next 20 years) in which the local, national, and/or global demand for jobs gradually and increasingly exceeds the supply of jobs (that only humans can still do)--can learn more by reviewing the MANY sources I've shared about possible tech unemployment on several local FB pages, including Civil Beat Politics, Politics in Hawaii-Think Tech Hawaii, and my own FB page.

Why would we incur massive debt levels to finance a $9-billion-plus project in order to offer subsidized power to American and Albertan consumers?  WA, OR and AB won't buy electricity from Site-C. They'll use cheaper natural gas or renewables. Site C is economically unfeasible and we'll be stuck with the most expensive power in North America.

Escalation of this conflict now puts Trump in the same position as Lydnon Johnson's Vietnam. Initially Trump's ratings will now go up. In the end he will   end up just as Johnston and Nixon. Bombing the H out of an enemy did not work in Vietnam, what makes one think it will work in Afghanistan?. Same strategy same result unfortunately

0,"The quick answer is no, it's not clear at this point what the building code and/or regulations required.  But there will be plenty of blame to go around: the architect who selected the cladding & insulation, engineers who may have signed off, local authorities who approved, the installers who may not have followed manufacturer's warnings, the manufacturer whose warning re. buildings over 10 metres may have been unclear with respect to the known fire hazard, etc.  Lest Canadians think that our high-rises are safe from exceptional fire hazards, people should be aware that there are multiple instances where large, vulnerable facilities have been built next to high-pressure pipelines.  Unlike the legal uncertainties in the Grenfell situation, the regulations in Ontario are very clear when it comes to public safety: the problem is that municipal planners are ignoring those requirements and the Ministry that has imposed the requirement has no Compliance personnel to enforce them.

0,"SD, I don't think there needs to be incentives for long term investing.  Long term investing is the smart thing to do without having an incentive to do it!   In determining an income tax system at any governmental level we should start with the proposition that income, is income, is income and all income should be taxed at the same rate.  I also firmly believe that the income tax should be graduated and there should be about 20 levels of graduation.  When the rich are drafted into the military to be infantry, artillery, combat engineer, and armor privates, then they can pay the same tax rate as those individuals earning $11,770 or less per year.  https://aspe.hhs.gov/2015-poverty-guidelines  Bottom line, any debate about taxes and the tax system that doesn't simplify and make the tax system so transparent that an Oregon high school graduate can understand it; is nothing more than more of the same, increasing the local, state, and national debt.

I don't think the leafs are true contenders quite yet, but they probably are a whole year ahead of schedule - and if they do earn playoff spot, anything can happen because as we've seen, they've beaten just about everyone in the east except the Habs, but I would love to see a playoff series between the two former rivals. The Habs arent that good. And if Price is bad or hurt, they're really not good ...goaltering is important, but more so in Montreal - and Columbus than anywhere else  But the point is that getting Matthews, then Anderson and having the best coach in hockey explains the accelerated rebuild.

0,"Ortho-toxic is a non-word coined as a pejorative with which to label those Catholics who are not persuaded by the persistent onslaught of progressivism. If the laws of the Sabbath were made for man then it behoved the Jews to keep them. In the Church there are two types of law, the Natural Law written by God in men's hearts, the Divine Law revealed by God in the Scriptures and Apostolic Tradition which cannot be ignored or changed and the Precepts of the Church which the Church has the authority to impose and remit. You don't seem to take this into account. Bishop Paprocki is only upholding the teaching of his Church, what else ought a Catholic bishop do? He cannot overrule the Law of God, Natural or Divine. Mercy which confirms someone in their sinful state is a false mercy. It can be likened to encouraging the Gadarene swine to go over the cliff. +Paprocki offers to all the prospect of repentance, reconciliation and a firm purpose of amendment just as Christ would have done.

Now we're looking at an income tax or sales tax on Alaskans to keep the money export business strong. Ted Stevens is gone so what else brings money into the state, oil, but what if there is no more oil money, shouldn't the state be looking into just what assets it is throwing away. Sure the outside businesses are saying we are giving you jobs but so does any business and the profits go out of state and when the people that have these jobs buy anything it too will go out of state. Just like a person or town or city or state or country you must have income to exist. Soon people will be selling assets if there are buyers just to stay solvent and many will leave because Alaskans fiddled while the resource bank was being robbed.

0,"Please check out a few recent histories of both Pearl Harbor and the Lusitania: - Pearl Harbor - most historians show that FDR was moving the US towards war and thus failed to adequately have forces notified or alert to Japanese intentions.  FDR's Japan Policy cut Japan off from all fuels, iron ore, etc. that would have allowed Japan to expand normally.  Most historians do not focus on this contributing factor.  But very few recognized historians show that FDR, staff, etc. knew or expected a sneak attack. Robert Stinnett - Day of Deceit - poses warning of the attack was on FDR's desk  - Lusitania - the best historical studies indicate that the Lusitania was carrying arms violating the German warning.  This was part of the unofficial US policy to help arm and feed Great Britain.  See Erik Larson's Dead Wake - Did the British Admiralty fail to provide a naval escort for the Lusitania because its likely sinking would draw the U.S. into the war?  Unable to answer that question.

0,"Shar-M, I am not even sure they know what to do, what to change.  Do they care?  The loss of trust is so massive in some places in Europe, Ireland, Canada, U.S., Australia that it undermines believability in what they say are truths in the faith itself.  It wasn't just the sex abuse scandal, but also issues like contraceptives, in vitro fertilization, sexual ethics, confession (most Catholics don't bother any more), even all the to-do over Mass translations - so many other things.  I don't think we can restore trust in the relationship as it used to be.  I am not a child and a priest or bishop is not my father; nor am I a sheep and he is my shepherd.  What we need is a new relationship, one that is based on respect for the intelligence, knowledge, and adulthood of the laity.  One that respects women as equal to and as capable as men. And one that lets us inside their heads, inside the functioning and decision making of the Church.  Probably not gonna happen - ever? for a long time?

In other words, psychological services in the US are nether designed nor capable of seeking out the neurotic who might pose a danger of becoming mass killers. Or again in other words, a societal decision to focus on mental defects as a strategy for preventing mass killings is doomed to failure.

Not only that, but exactly what kind of restrictions are required can be gleaned by examining details of the practices of other countries. The minimalist suggestions under consideration are insufficient.

They'll never forgive him for that. In the 1600s, King Louis XIV gathered all power unto himself, and in exchange, spent lavishly on the nobility and gave the them special privileges. By the 1780s, the French treasury was becoming bankrupt (thanks in part to French military assistance in the American War of Independence), but the nobility continued to spend extravagantly while the lower classes were starving in the streets and in their shacks on rich estates. Louis XVI convened a special assembly and asked the nobility to tax itself. The nobility refused. We all know what followed. The upper class has an extraordinary sense of its own worth and privilege -- at times, at the expense of common sense and self-survival.

This makes it difficult for a one agenda MP making an all or nothing ultimatum to influence policy.  He is not the kind of leader to be boxed in, to the detriment of the Party.  It also places the MP in a role of treachery and the issue in disrepute.  No one ever wins stabbing a popular leader in the back.  Scheer, by every indication, is likely to become popular with Canadians. It is a matter for him and his team to translate this to votes.  It is even difficult for wedge issues to damage this demeanour which is a primary indicator of momentum.  Scheer is not a compromise candidate.  He was the best choice of the selection  considered.

There are MANY things that both that song and the flag represent, and a person taking issue with one of those things isn't necessarily taking issue with all.  If you want to see true disrespect of the country, just look to the White House.  Trump aggressively avoided military service.  Simply put, he's a draft dodger.  He also spoke out against our Constitutional rights, which is subversion.

Take one example: he says he supports free trade, yet he voted to confirm Robert Lighthizer as Trade Representative & he opposes NAFTA. Other NeverTrumpers such as Ben Sasse voted against him. Lastly, it seems to me that Flake could learn from Goldwater. Goldwater was always a very reflective person, & in later life adjusted certain beliefs. Flake shows no indication of recognizing that the economic agenda he so ardently supports fails to speak to his own party anymore, let alone moderates, & of adjusting certain policies, such as de-stabilizing insurance subsidy markets.

He was a corporate shill for Portland Business Alliance and the paper's advertisers.   His many editorials unthinkingly supporting a $3 to $4 billion  Columbia River Crossing, a government project, would not have been written by a true Libertarian.   Lukens was also, like Christian Anderson, a bully.  He told Brad Avakian in an editorial interview  that he would destroy Avakian's political career.   Whether or not you are a Democrat or Republican, that's not the way you want the Oregonian editorial editor to bully people around.    Lukens felt bully-like after he helped to end Jefferson Smith's candidacy for Mayor, and virtually ran Charlie Hales from office.   He can help take the Bulletin down.

0,"From an ADN article about the Pogo attack, """"It happened so fast that neither woman had time to deploy bear spray initially, Murphy said. Trainor reportedly sprayed the black bear twice, he said, which likely saved her life.""""  I'm not sure there's a definitive conclusion about the efficacy of pepper spray in that situation. I personally own both bear guns and pepper spray, and I live in an area that has many bears.  I had bear prints in my strawberry beds yesterday.  I never carry a gun when I'm walking, because I don't want the weight, and because I personally think pepper spray is superior.  It's easy to carry, easy to deploy,  and accuracy isn't an issue.  I also like the fact that it isn't lethal, which was the point of my initial post.

0,"That is the part of the letter that you found so insightful? It seems to ignore plenty of nuance. A sales tax is paid by the consumer. This tax will be in part passed on to the consumer and in part not. Anyone claiming just one or the other is wrong.  Company A: a power utility in Oregon. It will petition to raise rates in accordance with the increase in expense and it is likely that the increase will be approved for some portion of the tax. Thus the tax will likely be largely passed on to the consumer and it can be viewed as a sales tax.  Company B: sells a consumer widget that has its price set nationally. It will pay the tax and this tax will play a small part in the company's deliberations on how to set its next round of national pricing. In this case the tax is not a sales tax, but a corporate tax of which very little gets passed on to Oregon consumers.  I own a company and have employees. I sell internationally, and very little of my revenue is local. I'm not affected by the tax.

People of no faith, as well as believers and everyone in between.  People who had been soaked were completely dry as the sun spun, dropped toward earth, ascended back up etc.  People were healed.  The miracle was foretold by date and time months in advance.  It was a gift of grace to reinforce faith.  The Church found the apparition """"worthy of belief"""" and several Popes have visited Fatima including JPII.  They consulted with Sister Lucia during her life as well.  At least 2 tried to do as the Blessed Mother requested at Fatima and made a special consecration with many Bishops present.  Considering all this and the accuracy of the prediction of WWII etc., and that nothing in the apparition can do anything but draw one closer to God, it seems foolish not to take it seriously.

He went on to further tell me that """"The Rosary is a good weapon to protect us from our own sinful nature and especially the sins of impurity."""" I knew Jesus was talking to me personally.

To just talk about cutting ignores that reality, leads a person to complacency, and will cause Alaska to collapse into a depression.  To think that you can replace a teacher with a computer is absolutely wrong. Computers are extremely limited. Even the best students blossom under the instruction and interaction with a great teacher. Average and below students don't do well at all with computer instruction - it is just too rote. I have experience in this area and have read studies that show that students who have learned their math through a computer interface can't go beyond that interface - can't think for themselves under other conditions. They don't actually learn the math well. Yes, computers work well when you're paying a bill or renewing a driver's license, but not in an arena where activities should be dynamic - like education.

0,"One of the really important things is to keep a sense of proportion. The last time I checked, Greater London had a population of about 12 million people. Given that population, the city should see in excess of 100,000 deaths a year from all causes, or about 300 per day. The deaths caused by the occasional terrorist attack are a negligible fraction of the total deaths. Terrorism is a nuisance, not a major threat. Even the 3,000 deaths caused by 9/11 were not terribly significant; the """"worst terrorist attack ever"""" killed about the same number of Americans as are shot to death each month by other Americans, and caused property damage (around $50 billion) equal to a fraction of a percent of American GDP. The response to 9/11, on the other hand, has killed at least hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of people and cost the US literally trillions of dollars.

Even a slight miscalculation can cause the users to go blind or die.

For some reason, when an illegal drug supplier adds fentanyl to their product and people die, they are not held to the same standard.  Low level street dealers are typically not even charged with an offence, and simply have their wares seized and destroyed.  If someone dies or overdoses from fentanyl contaminated drugs, the dealers should be immediately arrested and charged with manslaughter or murder.  They will immediately roll over and rat out their suppliers and so on.  If the police and justice system were serious about stopping the overdose crisis, they would start rounding up the low level dealers.

And what has happened is that  Junior has started off with a budget containing a deficit fully three times what he promised the maximum deficit would be.  Now, his prescription for the economy """"we shall grow the economy outwards from the heart"""" has obviously fallen by the way side.  I was skeptical about this one, too, mainly because like most of Junior's unscripted musings it made no sense whatsoever.  Perhaps the answer is to listen even more obediently to the brain power behind the Trudeau throne, Gerald Butts.  Perhaps growing the economy outward from one's Butts would work better.  But given Butts' demolition derby performance in Ontario, probably not.  And it will get worse under The Clown Prince in 2017.

YOU refuse to address this. And now you are blaming me for your refusal, which is dishonest.  I believe that your refusal to address this very real question is because you would have to say one of two things: (1) """"Yes, two deaths are better than one"""" or (2) """"My moral absolutism is wrong in this case"""".

The article suggests that the Board would be doing the review, and you comment suggests that the Board is already currently performing single subject reviews. Would you (or the R-G, if they have the answer already and didn't include it in the story) please clarify?  2) You comments suggest that prospective initiatives are not currently reviewed for """"county concern,"""" yet Lane Code 2.635 already requires that prospective initiatives """"propose[] in a proper manner a measure of County legislation"""" before they can be submitted to the voters by the County Clerk. If prospective initiatives are not currently being reviewed for """"county concern,"""" doesn't this really just suggest a personnel problem, not an ordinance problem?  John Roberts

0,"My mother came over in 1956 as a refugee on one of the last boats through Ellis Island, her parents had survived the Holocaust and she was born in a refugee camp, no other nation would take them, so they had to wait before being able to come here.  The reality is that for a long time, we have throttled in one way, shape or form who we let into the country.  If you want that to change, then get the law changed.  It isn't a human right to be able to enter a country and take up residence without the government of that nation's permission.  You can't move from here to Europe and expect to be able to just become a citizen, you can't move from here to Mexico and just expect to be able to become a citizen, so please tell me why it should be that way here.

0,"The problem for the church today remains what it's always been: is the institutional church needed for one to follow Jesus?  Community is important as a means to support each other, but is it necessary for somebody we don't know to fly in from out of town and define what our community must be?  How much of what we see in the  institutional church has been set up to support our individual efforts to follow Jesus, versus to support and sustain an almost cultic caste of men?  We can ask these kinds of questions rhetorically, but we can also ask them sincerely, and search for answers n our hearts.  The institutional church is in trouble.  Because the bishops have convinced themselves that they cannot change an inferred negative they see in the life of Jesus, they now must face a reality wherein they could find themselves thinking Jesus either erred, OR that he will send some kind of deux ex machina  to fix the problem.  That can't be comfortable for them...

In legal language the provision was """"overbroad""""  and would catch family members, humanitarian workers and migrants helping other migrants in its reach.  See R. v.

Sadly, it has ceded its place in the """"public square"""" to ridicule and/or irrelevance. On a more general level, Christianity, led by Catholicism has so absorbed human values into religion that as such they have a) become ideological and thus divisive and excluding; b) they have become dogmaticly definitive to be followed rotely, without reflective thought, and c) having lost their basis in real human life, living, """"boots on my ground"""", they have become part of a logic, a system that has little evidence of being grounded in me, in us. To the point """"Ethics"""" is either a """"catechism"""" item of religiosity that is imposed or an esoteric consideration for specific professions, like bioethics.

0,"Ignoring the evil of Arpaio, and just commenting on the pardon.  To critique a Harvard professor is easy.  Just read the sentence in article two of the Constitution and it has No limitations on the pardon other than excluding it from impeachment pardons.  I Taught the Constitution for 30 years in public schools so I have reread it many times and have a pretty good idea of what it says.  How it is applied is the job of harvard educated lawyers and other legal minds to find ways to twist the words and meanings to reflect the needs of their paying clients. It is the duty of citizens in a republic to inform themselves and not just rely on what those in authority decide to tell them.  Some things are subject to interpretations, but pardon power is black and white.

I'd not been to church for awhile, so I stopped in just as the sermon began. There were maybe 30 people in attendance. A few minutes into the sermon a middle aged couple came in. The pastor stopped his sermon, looked at the new comers and said """"Welcome hypocrites."""" Those in the pews were shocked. Then the pastor said we are all hypocrites to some degree, so welcome, friends. I stayed after the service & told the pastor how much I admired his courage and the ultimate message of his greeting to that couple & the rest of his sermon.  He made everyone think and reflect on ourselves. Too many people avoid church because they observe imperfect behavior & hypocrisy in some church goers.

He's a salesman selling what people want to hear, but he's delivered nothing of significance in terms of legislation, while alienating more of the developed world with his personal arrogance, and apparent disinterest in facts.  Doesn't matter what I think of the man, the question at this point is if he has created a crime and would that rise to the level of impeachment.

So again I say with freedom comes personal responsibility. That means not doing unto ourselves what we fought to escape from having done to us. We fought for the vote -- and then don't vote. We find it easier to chatter about Roe v. Wade, than personal responsibility and accountability for defining the limitations that are celebrations of both freedom and responsibility. Yes, we've come a long way baby, but not quite far enough. So single issue voting is an excuse for not wanting to accept responsibility for the full weight of the freedom to vote.

Hick gives lip service to minorities and the poor, but in actions he was a student at Mines who planned to go into the oil biz but came out of school during a crash, so he went into real estate instead. Compared to Pena who built a (questionable) airport, as mayor of Denver Hick grew the prison industrial complex by building two fancy courthouses, the fees for which are tagged on to the costs charged to the poor who find themselves in court. As gov I'd say his most significant action has been supporting the oil and fracking industries over the people who live in the communities being affected (but then he is an oil guy). And he pardoned Dunlap, which was lip service to the minority community and has no real consequences.  Both parties and both guys are the same; they care about money and what the 1% want, while talking guns, abortion and pardons to get their followers to vote against their own  financial and health interests.

Truth is they are very happy with that taxpayer funded benefit even when it vastly subsidises one or two parties over all the others. I remember reading something a few years ago about the Conservatives amassing about 80% of that years taxable benefit while only having the support of 38% of the populace.  Some people  only complain about taxpayer benefits if they aren't personally benefiting from them. After watching what has happened in the USA, I would prefer a system where there is a per vote and sustaining amount paid to parties and all other monies banned and restricting govt advertising in election year.  There's no honest need for the massive expenditures now used in elections.

But it repeats the current, incorrect populist mistake of blaming relatively recent green energy initiatives for current cost pressures. Green energy decisions, apart from demonstrably improving air quality (and where is that benefit reflected in the decision calculus?) are a marginal factor here. Rather, decisions made decades ago to use nuclear power are the primary cost drivers - nuclear power plants have consistently cost more to build than expected, have lasted no where near as long as expected and have cost more to refurbish than expected. Nuclear energy has, with the benefit of hindsight, not worked out well pretty much every where it has been tried - the UK and Germany are currently struggling with these issues and the US Westinghouse division of Toshiba corporation is filing for bankruptcy.

0,"I think Ciezadlo presents basically one side of what is happening. Assad is a ruthless blood-thirsty dictator as was his father. Many of his opponents are not much better but their weapons are not as lethal as his and so they come across as more benign. Some of his opponents are secular and progressive people but many are really blood-thirsty jihadists many of whom are not Syrians. The percentages of each group are debatable. Many of Assad's followers are Alawites, Shiites, Christians, and other minorities who have suffered at the hands of jihadists and are very fearful of these jihadists among Assad's opponents. Think of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 Russia where many elements were against the Czar but eventually the most blood-thirsty group, the Bolsheviks, ended up on top.  The violence on BOTH sides needs to be condemned and an inclusive comprehensive political solution is the only answer.

The analogy of the Bride and the Bridegroom, beautiful as it is, is just an analogy and, as such, my no means exhausts the Christ-Church mystery (Ephesians 5:32).  This is very clearly explained in the Theology of the Body, but many people still prefer to remain within the traditional boundaries of patriarchal gender ideology.

Let's be clear that HART is the one indicating the estimated cost, with finance charges, is about $10 billion.  If you'd like justification for that number, please ask HART.

The point of my original comment was to comment (redundant, I know) on the second para that it was due to her choice not to comment on the trip that """"suspicions"""" were """"heightened"""" thus the uncertainty on her motivations.  Shoulda been clearer.  Full disclosure, I did not vote for Rep. Gabbard.  I disagree w/ most of her politics.  It was just a speculative comment on a reason for her not commenting to the press.  If it were I, I would follow the connection w/ Kucinich.  It would probably lead to a more broader perspective on motive & motivations.  They were both incorrectly characterized, though; my opinion is they both are leftists, not progressives.

The massive mill buildings may help break some of the wave action too, but material stored in that area, like log piles, should be secured to prevent it from becoming battering rams for the wave(s). Log loaders and other heavy equipment useful in cleanup must be among the first assets moved to high ground, but the roads they ascend may not be easily passable descending after being shaken apart and flooded so bladed tractors like cats and skidders will be needed too.

Just like UO did with Nike supplemental money for football coaches,  so that they can live in splendid luxury in retirement.  That the money now comes from rank and file employee pay is only fair.

There is a small company in the Western Cape that, some years ago, had some useful patents on desalination. They are now largely outdated because, yes, technology advances.  But technological advances have not yet reduced the cost of desalination to the point that it is competitive with the alternatives available to Cape Town - such as groundwater from the Table Mountain aquifer or a top-up of Voelvlei from the Berg River.  Indeed, a careful analysis of the decision-making record to be published later this month will show that the immediate cause of the Cape Town crisis was the decision of politicians and senior officials to override expert advice because they knew best. I could call it colonial ignorance but it is actually part of a global trend to argue against physical reality, epitomised by that man in the USA. So perhaps it is just normal Capetonian arrogance?

The two women whose car Maloata hit and were injured in the process are probably going to sue him. He's young, so I hope he sees the serious mistakes he made, pays restitution, and sees outcome of this case as a second chance to get his life straightened out.

Zero interest rates - sure that is factored into the price.  But I can assure you that the so called cash buyer doesn't drive off the lot with a materially lower price than the financed buyer.  Why?  Because the majority of buyers don't have cash to buy a new $40k+ vehicle and will be seeking at least some kind of financing.  Meaning that the dealer has little incentive to offer real discounts for cash.  So negotiate your best price and take the zero percent rate.  Discounts -  those are built into the price and marketing strategies.  The benefit to the consumer is the ability to start price negotiation closer to the eventual sales price.  As to your acid test - once a car leaves the lot it is used and has a lower resale value from both the customer and dealer point of view.  Which is why the low mileage used market is sought after.

0,"I'm no fan of Wynne either, but in this case she got it right.  I doubt she's doing it because she thinks it's good policy, but it's the result that counts.  Tolls are just bad policy.  We pay taxes so that society as a whole can share the burden for things that benefit us all.  Consider that I have no children and yet I pay school taxes; I consider this to be reasonable - education benefits our society as a whole.  Similarly, a well-maintained highway system permits the easy movement of people and goods; it benefits us all.  Ask this; once we have the precedent of government charging user fees for highways, what else will politicians look to impose user fees on?  Taxes are already onerous, and anything that will allow politicians to increase taxes, without _seeming_ to raise taxes looks good to them.  Shouldn't they be controlling spending instead?  It's more difficult, but better for our society in the end.

0,"Yes it is the will of the people.  Concentrating the results to almost always achieve a majority is a feature of the system, not a bug.  I am happy we have a system that works to create a majority that is wholly responsible until the next election and cannot make excuses for results.  PR makes responsible government much more difficult (or impossible) as you have constant negotiations within the coalition and therefore many excuses at electoral time for not delivering.  I will leave a discussion of how PR disenfranchises rural Canada to another time and place.  Going to a separate round of voting or preferential voting to get to 50% +1 is a """"leftie thing"""".  There are 2 parties that shade left in Canada, so there is a bias to the left and so it is favored by the left because the current system causes that leftie vote to split.  Strangely I didn't hear this complaint from the right when they were split (PCs and Reform) and the Liberals kept winning effortlessly.

0,"One idea for affordable housing: build condo type apartments: sell to tenants; investors can realize a profit although maybe more modest. Residents more likely to take care of residence if owner. Limited partnerships also could be tapped.  IRS has allowed exotic livestock, oil wells, cattle+ tax shelters for upper income persons. Do that for housing for a trial period? Also, start community fund that can help people get into living quarters with minimal $ down like FmHA did years ago ($500). My IRA gets only 1% in credit union. I was a Realtor in program-lottery system: new loan package prepped for every client for any new inventory. Buyers who had C sections, mill accidents, etc.  An idea: lottery tickets for helping people with down payments. BTW, NEDCO has a program that gives $10,000 to a home buyer; some training involved.  Also some investors own 50 houses: a few might sell houses with more deferred maintenance. Purchasers can buy it owner financing. Some loans allow repairs.

If I vote for her, and after her eight years we are so mired in the Middle East America is bankrupt, we are in a horrible ground war with Iran, and the Israeli right has walled off all the Palestinians...still, I am to blame as I voted for her. If Trump gets in, and the American far right rules both the White House and the Senate, I get to see ten years of Supreme Court decisions that please David Duke and those who hate national health care.

Beyond that many of His followers are and were inspired; some more directly than others, and there were some over centuries; to claim that only Adventists had this privilege a bit arrogant. In so far as they speak/write according to Bible principles, many are inspired today. I trust you read other Christian material apart from the Bible.  Almost everyone has a favorite author. I enjoy C.S. Lewis and even visited his estate in England with others who admired his writing. Does that make me shun the Bible. Of course not. There are evangelists in all ages who have a special gift for reaching people in their culture.

0,"Dr. Gordon analysis is highly warped based on political bias and not economics (yes, I have a copy of it). First, there is absolutely no proof that foreign demand is driving up the demand for housing in Toronto.  Unlike Vancouver, there are no empty units . Demand is coming from  population growth.  The GTA (Halton, Peel, Toronto, York and Durham) has about 45% of Ontario's population (2011) but accounted for about 60% of the population growth i.e. strong population-based demand Condominium construction is keeping up with demand but the construction of single detached, semis and row/townhouses are not thus creating a shortage The assertion that people not selling because they don't feel that they are at the top of boom is noting more ideologically-based speculation.  It is more likely that land transfer taxes and real estate fees, which are based on selling price has tipped the scales towards renovation, not selling.  Also, when someone sells they still have to buy.

CB receptor signaling modulates pain and analgesia, inflammation, appetite, gastrointestinal motility, neuroprotection and neurogeneration, along with the ebb and flow of immune cells, hormones, and other mood-altering neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate (213). Cannabinoids (endo [naturally occurring], herbal, and synthetic) are anti-inflammatory; they literally cool the body. But... if the immune system overreacts to chronic stress or mistakes one’s body for a foreign object, then the stage is set for another autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder to develop.

0,"Part 2 At Vatican II, there was a very different 'play-book'' used.  The vast amount of scholarly work carried out by eminent Catholic theologians over a number of decades leading up to Vatican II provided enough evidence to the bishops that there was a solid justification to embrace the major shifts in Church doctrine and practice.  One of these areas is found in """"Gaudium et spes"""" [approved on December 7, 1965, by a vote of 2,309 to 75]. which stressed the limited competence of church leaders in the life of the church and in society.  There is a humility in the description of church leadership that leads to a recognition of the need for a greater role for the laity and a shared sense of responsibility for the development of ecclesial and social life [GS 43].  The papacies of JP II and Benedict---were marked by revanchist policies where the major reforms of Vatican II---collegiality, subsidiarity, and synodalism were pushed away, rejected, or 'double-talked' out of existence.

You are also ignoring the fact of how popular the AR-15 rifle has become among gun owners.   Millions of these murderous weapons are owned here in America now.   Every single person that owns one of these guns has a weapon that can easily be illegally converted into a machine gun!  The states of both New York and California both estimate that the majority of the Assault rifles owned in those states have not been legally registered by their owners!  There is no more a legitimate need or right to own a AR-15, than there is to own a 50 caliber machine gun.   Both are extremely dangerous.

Once the war was over he naturally expected the USA to honor that alliance but instead we used Liberty Ships to bring French Foreign Legion troops back to Viet Nam(French Indochina) and combined them with Japanese POW's to hunt down the Viet Minh. Treachery of the highest order. Ho was a Jeffersonian scholar educated at the Sorbonne so when he realized how he was being stabbed his comment was , """"I can't believe that our American allies are doing this.

0,"There is a difference between a rent freeze and rent control.  A freeze would certainly be temporary until a more sustainable solution is in place, like rent control. Rent control isn't a monolith. It has been enacted (effectively) in many variations throughout the western world. Generally,  it allows for rents on occupied units to increase according to economic indicators, with some exceptions made for major capital improvements. And units reset to market upon vacancy, so it necessarily requires some strong protections against involuntary  displacement, so that a landlord doesn't kick  a tenant to raise the rent.  It's a fallacy to say that it hasn't worked to create general affordability in SF/NYC, that's not what it was designed to do. It is a tool to stabilize existing tenants in their homes and communities. Which matters.  It works GREAT for that.  Mom&pop might need to get a different job if intimidation & forcing ppl into bankruptcy and homelessness isn't penciling out.

0,"The Ontario rate is so high because all of the elements that comprise the total bill include the embedded debt of Ontario Hydro.  In 1995, the embedded debt of Ontario Hydro was already somewhere in the vicinity of $22 million It may have been in the $billions (I'd have to go back and check).  Interest has been accruing on that.  This is why Harris was in a desperate hurry to sell-off Ontario Hydro, but, of course, that was not a solution.  The debt is there and it is accruing interest.  The cost of maintaining the Provincial and municipal grids is also built into the overall bill.  5 of the 7 line items that comprise the total bill ring up a charge every time a kWh is used.  It was beyond the G&M or Toronto Star to explain these line items to consumers.  They even rejected a freelance article that explained it very clearly.  When someone says """"the price of electricity is 6 cent/kWh"""" they are referring to the commodity price of electricity itself.  Six other line items get rolled in.

Economic cycles are, well, cyclical.  For the past 75 years we've been working on pretty consistent periods of about 9 or 10 years from one recession to the next, and it has been 8 and a half years since the last recession started.  The chance of another recession happening in the next 4 years is extremely high.  The real question is how bad will the next recession be.  Will it be something very mild like the 1999 recession that began with the whole 'dot.com' bubble bursting?  Or will it be something much more severe like the recessions of the early 1980's or early 1990's?  I doubt we'll see a repeat of the 2008 recession, though I'm not foolish enough to claim I could predict such a thing with any certainty.

This ideology itself is often referred to as """"American exceptionalism.""""[4] Second is the idea that the U.S. has a unique mission to transform the world. Abraham Lincoln stated in the Gettysburg address (1863), that Americans have a duty to ensure that """"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.""""

It is actually more frustrating, for these youth, to deal with a church leadership that tries to make them hope again that maybe they will listen to the real problems in our church, only to open up a survey and face a set of questions that clearly proves they won't.  The laity must stand up for justice and demand full equality, and women ordained the exact same away, thru the same exact sacrament as men, based on exact same criteria, solely on character, ability and skill, and not at all upon a person's flesh, just as Jesus Christ taught how we should treat all people as we wish, or we sin.  We must stop judging groups of people such as LGBT, feminists, etc.  Jesus never valued the original apostles as special priests or ordained them differently than the rest of the Royal Priesthood, us, at least not according to any Gospel or the original 12's letters.  Jesus called them to represent the Jews as judges, only, which makes clericalism pure foolishness.

It does not authorize the free movement of people from foreign countries into the United States.  Nor does international law, which is based on natural law, disapprove of laws restricting immigration.  Nor would YOU, if you gave it serious thought.

We have to remembered that Trump is just a novice politician so he can't even lie properly. He haven't gotten the experiences of a veteran liar like Obama or Hillary or even Bush. He never held a political office of any kind of he is rather obvious. I am sure that he will catch on sooner or later. And his lies become more sneaky like the rest of the politicians out there. But right now, he is just a rookie and without any skill, it more obvious. It not like Obama saying """"you can keep your plan"""" type of sneaky lie, eh? And I know, we like our President to be more honest sounding which another way of saying....""""we want a some one who sound like a hypocrite"""" for president.

That's the *down side, to those who still care about them. On the up side, less druggies mean safer streets, less theft, less shoplifting, less burglaries, less drain on the 'incredibly scarce resources we have' (as the politicians always trumpet from their Golden Thrones), less amounts of all kinds of abuse, including to the children of the aforementioned junkies.  Having lost thousands of dollars, countless hours of time, several homes, a vehicle, and personal possessions to strung-out junkies that were once family, the sympathy tank is pretty much dry.

0,"Every once in a while, a few black parents start a ruckus about their kids having to read Huckleberry Finn because the N word is often used in the novel. Their reaction reflects a basic naivete about works of art and context: the use of the N word in this masterpiece is not meant to disparage blacks but to give a snapshot of the insulting ways people treated, and referred to, African-Americans at that time. As a matter of fact, H. Finn is considered to be one of the most anti-racist novels in the history of literature by literary scholars because it exposes the inhumanity of the pre-Civil-War white America and reveals the humanity of Jim. I believe this same principle of conscious or subconscious disregard and misunderstanding of the context is operating in the flap over the use of the N word by Bill Maher. Being too much of a comedian ever-ready for a funny repartee, Maher instinctively reacted to the straight man role of Ben Sasse, who fed him a line he couldn't resist.

As of 2015, the most recent year for which comparative data are available, Alaska tore apart families at the third highest rate in America – even when rates of child poverty are factored in.  When it comes to the number of children in foster care on any given day, Alaska was number one. Details here: http://bit.ly/2xRaW8f  There is no evidence that Alaska is the child abuse capital of America. The problems cited as reasons for Alaska’s high rate of tearing apart families, are as or more common in other states that take proportionately fewer children.  Nor does Alaska’s obscene rate of removal make children safer. All the time, money and effort spent needlessly removing children, often when family poverty is confused with “neglect,” is stolen from finding children in real danger.

That just takes the little guy out of the equation. The big guys now give their money to independent SuperPACs which is legal as long as they're not actual campaigns.  Other than perhaps tightening the rules on non-coordination with campaigns (which surely takes place behind the scenes), there's really no putting the genie back in the bottle for independent spending. As government has grown bigger and more powerful, there's more incentive to influence it. The only way to reverse that is to shrink the size and scope of government (i.e. reduce the incentive to control it).

The view seems ultramontane view being put forth, when even the idea of dialogue is frowned upon. The Holy Father has the unique power of being the supreme teacher he could end the debate, and most important bring some closing to the growing division that is getting increasingly venomous. Pope Leo X also chose to ignore dialogue, few would laud his handling or results.

China also does not seek to impose it's values on the rest of the world (except maybe making profits) which the US always has. I am not saying I am 100% comfortable with closer ties to China, but it is the prescient move and to be honest, these days, I think it is getting closer to a coin toss as to which super power has the moral high-ground.

The fact that there is an alternative public owned option is proof that the Governor wants to do the right thing.  Treasurer Read and Sec. of State Richardson, both of which took campaign $$$ donations from Lone Rock Resources (logging company that expressed they want to buy the Elliott for the cheap) shows they want to take the lazy and unethical route and sell this important forest.  We have less than 5% of old-growth/native forest left in Oregon and half of the Elliott- over 40,000 acres is native/old-growth healthy biodiverse forest.

Wall's regime used taxpayer's money to buy land from a Sask party supporter/land speculator at triple the appraised value. Many would call that crooked.  Wall went wild building highways and stadiums during the oil boom. His supporters claim there was an """"infrastructure deficit"""". Maybe so, but that doesn't excuse Wall's own lack of judgment with the public purse.  Wall's idea to """"incent"""" economic growth (as his incompetent finance minister put it) is to cut taxes on corporations and the rich while at the very same time increasing pst and cutting all kinds of things for everyone else.  Wall is a climate change Denier. Wall is a hypocrite and a sell-out because it wasn't that long ago that Wall actually was in favour of carbon pricing. Now he says it is horrible. What happened? Wall discovered that money talks louder than his ethics.  This is Wall's last term. Thank god for that.

0,"Those with much higher alcohol are already being dealt with in sentencing. The more over the limit the greater the possible penalty the judge is going to consider. This possible change to .05 adds the possibility of DUI to any dangerous driving charge (or other charge relating to a bad accident), to some cases.  Thus this can help with graded penalties to fit the crime(s), and can help with prevention. If it is known that being .08 or over increases the chance of causing an accident by 3.5 to 4 times as the article stated, then there are some accidents caused by people in this range - likely law-abiding people (they stayed under the limit!) who of course didn`t want to cause accidents. These are likely to again try to stay under the limit, and then these accidents by this group will be reduced.  If you want to drink more - bus or taxis are what folks use in most of the developed world with limit of .05!

Europe's example of """"let them in first, figure it out later"""" has failed miserably. As it stands, migrants are being rewarded by breaking the law. This will only lead to more illegal border crossings with hundreds turning to thousands. Amend the loopholes, go to court if necessary.

0,"Very nice article Brett, thanks. I'll add the mauling death of Crisencio Aliado to your collection of """"curiosities"""":  If youre unfamiliar, Cris Aliado was killed on July 29th 2016 on a Kalihi stream bank near Marukai (I assume the area is public, but havent looked into it). 2 dogs belonging to the owners of nearby Containerland were found nearby with """"blood-stained faces"""". The medical examiner's report later concluded that bites from these dogs caused Cris's death. That report also says the same 2 dogs previously attacked 2 other people in 2013. After Cris's death, the dogs werent put down or taken from the owners but instead were returned to them within a month of the attack and remain in their custody. The Police claim they don't have authority to impound (or release) animals. Apparently that determination falls to the Humane Society who visited the dogs every few weeks after releasing them back into their owners custody.  [continued below.....]

The oil companies are being propped up by the savings that the Republican ,gerrymandered, legislature has every intention of pouring into that very declining industry until the PFD is completely gone.

I'm under the impression that Pius XII's formulation still stands:  <<Adam and Eve can be considered as figurative, but the event is primeval; meaning that there has to be a first couple.>>  This notion is untenable. We are to believe that no sooner had humans developed moral consciousness than they were brought to the test and failed, thereby condemning the human race to a fallen state in perpetuity until redeemed by the Christ and brought to fulfillment on the last day.  As you say, evolutionary biologists and anthropologists have discounted the probability of a """"first couple."""" I have seen apologists jump through hoops to insist that yes, there was a first couple, in a desperate attempt to rescue what is clearly a myth about the origins of humanity and moral consciousness.  A bit of a problem for Christian theology.

The amount of money the state is taking in now is insignificant compared to the Two Billion we gave the oil companies right out of the gate when Parnell signed SB21 into law.

When Parnell signed SB21 into law he acknowledged that the state was taking a bath that would have to be made up for by belt tightening austerity measures. SB21 premised on more production and more jobs. That has not happened and it was never going to happen no matter what the price of oil. It was an is a lie pushed by the GOP/oil industry controlled legislature that further enriched industry in return for those oh so sweet campaign contributions. ACES could have been improved and that is what Parnell campaigned on until he won and then immediately switched into full repeal and replace mode. We were deceived by big false advertising.

0,"Before any new taxes are created, cut the budget further across the board except for what is necessary to protect people from other people. That is the fundamental purpose of government. Families & businesses cut their budgets to fit their income. The state should be no different. There can be no compromise with an income tax. Once you start it up again, it just gets worse. An income tax means the fruits of your labor do not belong to you. The government decides what you keep & collects it through coercion, intimidation & threats. That is why Alan Keys called it “the slave tax”. It is a tax for a collectivist society not a society founded upon the principals of individual liberty & freedom. Marx & Engels supported the income tax as the 2nd tenant of their “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founding Fathers, champions of freedom & individual liberty, did not believe in a direct tax on individuals. They supported tariffs, which is a consumption tax. A sales tax is a consumption tax.

I live here in the 'contemporaneous recession' you mention and I haven't devolved to injecting heroin, thievery, stealing from my neighbors, cutting locks with boltcutters to steal whatever I can for my next fix, ripping off stores, stealing mail, and a freakin' laundry list of crimes that are occurring like a wildfire all over Anchorage. It's called 'personal responsibility' and I have it. Locking junkies up may not be a complete fix but it will give a temporary reprieve to the citizenry while we work on a long-term solution. It's called Triage, and it's where we stand right now. That's no 'Draconian Fantasy'. Bringing over Rodrigo Duterte to deal with this situation would be that kind of fantasy.

Both of these have pretty astronomical capex costs.  For the battery option, the current attempts to introduce mass-production manufacturing methods could shave off a few percentage points from the cost, but nowhere near enough to make it a viable proposition for grid-level storage (at the multi-megawatt hour level).

Most voters vote Republican most of the time.  Before you attempt to attribute that fact to some allegation that there are millions of thwarted voters who would have voted Democrat but were not allowed to vote, do a little research.  Voter fraud - there may have been as many as 2.75 million people who voted in more than one state in the last Presidential election - may be working against the Democrats.  The Democrats should be worried about losing all the elections unless they can change votes.  And also, since we are in Hawaii - what are the minorities that concern you?

Vance Joseph was a joke of a hire and so was letting Wade Phillips go.  Elway is in over his head.  He needs better help with the draft and pursuing the right free agents.  And throw the ball longer than ten yards and stop this ridiculous """"dink and dunk"""" offense.  Get the ball to Charles in space.  Use your rookie Henderson.  Do something instead of the same old, same old while expecting different results.  The true definition of insanity.

If you have a pension plan you can SPLIT it with your partner into a lower tax bracket, but if a small business owner/physician does it Trudeau calls it SPRINKLING. Why?  So if you have a pension valued at $40,000 and are retired at 55 after working for the government you can SPRINKLE/SPLIT you income with your partner so you're taxed at $20,000 each...not to mention that the actuarial value of this pension will cost you almost $1,000,000. Good luck saving up for that with Gov Canada 10 year bonds paying 2% interest! Then subtract 2% annual inflation!  And what about couples that are divorced? Did you know that alimony is a SPRINKLING thing too? Yes, that's right. A person earning $200,000 per year who has to pay alimony will be taxed at a rate of $100,000 per partner PLUS they get double the RRSP room!!

These boards mirror the NSO's who hope to win the big one to get at all the FIFA money and run the pro leagues to the benefit of the males. It mirrors the old attitude that women should stay at home or work at home and a 9 to 5 too. Yep, I""""ve seen it at the club, league, PSO, NSO, Fed and FIFA levels  USSF and CSA are good examples of NSO's that don't show transparency of how the female side contribes to the NSO and how those profits are put back into their respecitve programs. The present legal stand off between the USSF and the USWNT will come to a head with the USSF loosing due to the USSF lack of transparency on how the TV, marketing and other profits for the USWNT are hidden in Soccer United Marketing.  UEFA has 28 females leagues and their approach is different than NA. They like their mens side do it for the sport. But then NA is still in diapers.

Science uses measures such as statistical significance, and variability and statistical error, and the climate studies and future projections incorporate these very concepts.

Of course not.  Your relationship with the state is neither voluntary nor consensual, but one compelled through force.  You were born a U.S. citizen without your permission.  You don't have a choice.  The state never needed your consent, ever.  As a child, they can force you to go to school.  As an adult, they can conscript you into the military.

But the key is our # 1 and 2 starters combined are 24-2... that will get you far. I have family who live in Denver and Boulder, am out there a lot to ski and hike and I'm a HUGE Broncos fan, so I follow the Rox and root for them when not playing my guys! They have had a terrific season and the fact their stating pitching staff is almost all rookies and has done very well says a lot about the future of this team. I always felt they needed to develope their own pitchers and get the kids used to pitching in a higher altitude at Co Springs instead of investing too much in high priced free agents who might be a bit intimidated at pitching in Denver. And the Rox have the perfect manger for this young staff in Black. They should overtake the D-Backs for the number one WC spot, and gain home field for the play-in game. GOOD LUCK!

0,"Alaska cannot get full value out of its oil and gas resources with our current leasing policy. Fact- Alaska owns 12.5% Royalty on oil and gas discovered under current leasing policy. Fact - The oil and gas industry owns 87.5% of all the oil discovered under the current leasing policy. Is that good policy? The oil and gas industry must have helped to craft the first oil and gas lease to put them in the cat birds seat right from the get go.  With SB 21, the oil and gas industry has built another pipeline from our treasury back to their coffers. So, essentially they own and benefit from almost 100% off all of our oil and gas under current oil and gas leasing policy. That is not right.  New leases need to be drafted that give Alaska at least 50% Royalty.  And, how we deal with the current legacy leases is another challenge that our legislature and administration need to attack by first repealing SB 21. That will be the first act to take our oil and gas back to gain maximum benefits.

The year's lease does not allow such a """"no cause"""" termination.

Because a literal reading of Genesis says so, and those jews in the desert 4000 years ago knew more about reality than scientists, except of course when they get sick, in which case they go to MD's trained in modern biology.

The truth is Francis isn't going to preserve the Church in the West with confusion about doctrine the majority of laity have already settled for themselves.  He needs to decide if the Church's mission is better served by his version of sowing ambiguity for the sake of the Burke's of the Catholic world, or biting the bullet and moving beyond the authoritarianism and black and white dogma the Burke's of the Church need for their own security.  If Jesus is the example we should follow, the decision is pretty clear.  We move beyond authoritarianism and black and white dogma.

So your example is a false one.  I did not say words are not important, I said  words that create no significant causal damage to anyone are not important.  If you were talking about an incident where significant causal damage was intended to an innocent victim, I would have a problem with Trump.  But that is not what we are discussing.  By the way, I walked on Sunday's debate after 15 minutes during which the media would not let the recent video go.  Trump is absolutely right that ISIS and so many other problems are so more compelling.  The focus on the trivial says it all.  Ask a woman dying of cancer what's important.

SWS has been reluctant to deploy bear proof cans because their automated garbage trucks can't unlock them, necessitating either the home owner remember to do it before pickup, or the driver get out of the garbage truck to do it (putting him behind schedule, and triggering an extra charge for the home owner).  Also, if the bears got smart enough, they could just cruise neighborhoods on garbage day in the morning before pickup and find all the bins unlocked.  (well, they probably aren't that smart - but they could also just get lucky).

0,"It is possible to have an industrial policy without taking the more fraught path of trying to advantage one economic sector relative to others. . Education. The rule of law Democratic government. Rooting out corruption. Logic-driven decision making. Energetic anti-trust enforcement. . All are important, if not essential, to success in innovation. . Canada has the disadvantage of being historically skewed toward resource extraction.  That legacy has many unintended consequences. . Canada has leaders - New Flyer in buses.  Bombardier in commuter rail.  CN is, dollar-for-dollar, the most profitable railroad in the world.  There are many examples. . Having the self-discipline to resist the temptation to compete with other governments on subsidies allows Canadian (or Dutch, or Swiss, or Danish, or ...) companies to make their own decisions on where best to allocate capital. . In the end, removing political market distortions and economic barriers to innovation is the best industrial policy.

0,"It is an often observed fact of many well-conducted studies over the past 3 or more decades that BC and Alberta have higher rates of child poverty than the national average and, in fact, that these rates are higher by a substantial extent than those in most other Provinces.  The gaps in wealth and income are greater in BC and Alberta than in most other Provinces as well.  Further, there is a disturbing trend for social tensions generated by these gaps to be attributed without proof to newcomers and foreign investors, mainly ethnic Chinese, rather than to domestic causes.  Alberta's new Government is with mixed success trying to redress these problems under very difficult economic conditions.  Hopefully, after the May General Election, BC will have a Government that will acknowledge that these problems exist and will try intelligently to begin to right the balance.

It's better we do this before this nut sends a missile towards us , than after we've lost a million innocent American lives .

0,"While I agree with almost all of Brenda's statements, I disagree that semi-auto handguns should be the first choice for women. I believe each individual should try a variety of different handguns and your purpose for them before investing on purchase. I have found a quality 4 inch barrel revolver is simple to operate, will induce confidence in placing its bullets in center mass, will provide 6 guaranteed shots, is impossible to jam as semi-autos have a tendency to do and is faster to reload providing we are not considering additional magazines for the auto.  Trigger pull in double action shooting with an American built Smith and Wesson revolver is no different than the quality semi-auto Glock made in Austria.  I would actually like to see how many women can work the slide on a 380 Beretta semi-auto.  I would have to believe Brenda must be sponsored by Glock to make such a one track statement, but at least in this Country we can have our opinion. Everything being equal, Buy American

0,"SOCIAL AND… ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR This is a good commentary.  Congratulations.  In a globalized world, such discussions are of primary importance.  And this is my view:  The human face is a crucial element in identifying an individual person.  This is why on personal identification documents – such as a passport or a driver’s licence – we attach images of our faces and not of our… hands or feet.  By covering the human face – either by a niqab, a burka or a combination of a turban and long beard – we obscure an individual’s identity.  This is a process, by the way, that certain religions destroy individuality and turn their adherents into… sheep – with their gods and prophets being the… shepherds.  If nothing else, face covering is plainly anti-social behaviour – and a primary duty of a democratic, and not… theocratic, government is to protect its citizens from such behaviour…  Thank you.  A.

My comment is a contribution to an internal discussion among Catholics about what position OUR OWN MORALITY OBLIGES us, qua Catholics,  to take in the wider forum of political debate about abortion in democratic societies.  You are making an entirely different case. You are arguing that democratic countries have a right to make laws, and in so far as laws prescribe and/or prohibit ACTIONS, and morality is about good versus bad action, then it is obvious governments are involved in the morality game.

That's how some media outlets have characterized his spending. It was actually $30,000 of his spending that was personal and paid back. The remaining $100,000 was work related.  The other important one has to do with the mechanics of the pCard. It's a credit card. Transactions are made, the bank sends the county a bill, and the county then pays it. If a reimbursement is made before the county pays the bill, then the taxpayers have never paid for that expense. So when Mayor Billy says the burden wasn't shifted to the taxpayer, he probably means he reimbursed the charge before the county paid the bill.  The media's responsibility in this is to give fair and accurate coverage. In many instances that's been lacking, and in those instances, it's the taxpayers who lose out.

Do you think Anchorage/Mat-su can support 20k-30k additional jobs? Hello crime and and hello urban poverty.  My hunch is that subsidizing their lifestyle by providing 'welfare for life' is actually the better option in the long run.

I'll point out what you're missing. 1) $50k down on a $400k condo (12.5%) means you're paying CMHC insurance, which is $10,850 for the first year (see CMHC website) and slightly less every year after. Assuming an average of $8k per year, you're out $40k over 5 years. 2) Did she do her own home inspection and legal paperwork at closing? If not, that's another $2k. How about land transfer tax? If she's not a first time home buyer, that's another $8k. 3) Opportunity cost - if the $50k down payment was invested in a bank stock with 4% dividend and assuming tax of 50%, she's still getting $5k over 5 years. 4) Repairs and maintenance at 1% of cost is $4k a year or $20k over 5 years. Recap:  Rent less dividend = $121k Ownership including all costs = $156k+mortgage insurance $40k+repairs $20k+closing costs $10k = $226k. You have paid off $52k of principal but you've paid $100k more than the renter. Renting wins.

No non-Constitutional law can be passed or amended by Parliament that conflicts with the Constitution of Canada—as interpreted by the sole arbitrator, the Supreme Court of Canada. Any effort by Parliament to change Constitutional laws (the Constitution itself, the Senate Act, the Supreme Court Act, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, etc.) must comply fully with the Amending Formula (also part of the Constitution of Canada).  The Constitution of Canada is the law that protects the people of Canada from Parliament. That is what makes the Constitution the supreme authority in our system of government, not Parliament.

Lindo, Isaac D. Swensen and Glen R. Waddell — wrote. They said their work was among the first to take a look at the “nonmonetary costs” of college sports.  This is an interesting study.  It does seem """"intuitive"""" that students would be more apt to spend weekends """"partying"""" etc instead of studying when they're involved in supporting a successful football team.

1,"Cam Rader - You're welcome to stop paying your taxes, but the federal government will eventually come to jail you, so that would be pretty dumb.  However, truly intelligent people don't pay more taxes than the tax code says they owe. Sometimes that means a business that has suffered huge losses in one year won't have to pay taxes for several years following. We can argue about whether that tax code should be changed so as to drive businesses into bankruptcy and put the employees on the welfare roles, but ultimately a business owner who intelligently works the tax code so that he keeps his business going and his employees drawing salaries instead of welfare benefits should be commended, not condemned.  I'm not a Trump supporter, but I know many business owners and they pay more taxes than I do, but yes, they work the tax code so they only pay the taxes they absolutely owe. That's called business sense ... something you clearly lack.

Varying translations at different dioceses is just another Protestant move that will do nothing to save souls.  Be sure to pick up your laminated card when you attend a new church, because it will be different from your own church.  The Catholic mass is no longer special.  English vernacular is a big reason for that.  It's like translating an Opera from its original language.  Carmen versus Carmen Jones.

What is amazing to me is that the mere suggestion that looking at night time lows might be interesting, generates resistance.  Resistance not based on having the curiosity to check it out and obtain different results, but based on the apparent belief that asking any questions is heresy and evidence of anti-science.  Take it from a hard core scientist.  Questions are good and the answers to questions provide enlightenment.  I don't care if you are shocked.

Like all Fascist speeches, it configured the Fatherland as weak and a laughingstock, threatened imminently with being wiped out. It is this paranoia and poor self-image that drives Fascist aggression. Above all, Trump upholds the values of fear, timidity and paranoia. A small radical fringe in the Muslim world cannot menace America’s civilization. But a far right white nationalist president with serious mental issues can.

The European experience shows that when one group maintains its own identity and culture when entering a new culture and society often times what emerges is ethnic strife and isolation.  The American model of encouraging immigrants to become Americans first and leave their former identities in the old country seems in this fast changing world to be an intelligent choice.  Canada, with its open society, women's rights, freedom of speech, rule of law and free market system should be encouraged and strengthened by all who arrive as immigrants.  Despite what Justin Trudeau says, Canadian traditions and identity are precious and infinitely valuable in this unstable world and should be strengthened - not watered down.

Our three major imports from Mexico are supply chain items like Vehicles, machinery, and electrical machinery-- make up $186 Billion of US imports from Mexico, everything else totals just $47 Billion.

While Canadians are privileged not to require a visa (passport sticky) to enter the U.S. in most cases, they still must meet the requirements for the visa category under which they are traveling.  Immigration requires a visa as do a few non-immigration categories.  2.  All persons (including Canadians) seeking the to enter the U.S. are presumed to be doing so for the purpose of immigration.  It is up to the individual to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the CBSA officer that their purpose is otherwise.  3.  The woman referred to was unable to make her case.  She was therefore considered to be seeking entry for the purpose of immigration and was correctly informed that she needed a visa.  4.  Even the possession of a valid visa does not guarantee entry.  This is why pre-clearance, if available, is desirable.  If you are denied entry, you don't need to find a way back to your country of origin.  Pre-clearance doesn't apply in this case but is used to show the reality of the border.

Competing rights claims should be reconciled through accommodation if possible, and if a conflict cannot be avoided, through case-by-case balancing.

At that time BCFN will get “their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.”  At that time BCFN will have legal rights and title to their traditional territories and will be able to work with the governments and companies who want access to BCFN traditional territories. Then BCFN will be able to be a core partner with those that want to do business on BCFN traditional territories. BCFN will be able to move away from the colonial payments as they will be able to manage their traditional territories to once again live of and still manage all for their future prosperity.

I have looked for contrary opinion contemporary to those which deny his authorship and have found none.  I'm willing to go where facts point, regardless of the outcome.

0,"Probably Jack will never have to consider an abortion for himself, but maybe he has a thirteen year old daughter who became pregnant somehow, doesn't want a baby, and knows her dad would forbid an abortion. Almost 90% of abortions are during the first trimester. A vanishingly small percentage are late-term and most of those are owing to fetal abnormality and/or threat to the health of the mother.  In the US, 45% of abortions were for women who did not intend to become pregnant. Planned Parenthood provides contraception information and also, contraception for women who can't afford to buy it. Also, condoms for men. Yet Republican policy is to defund Planned Parenthood, and this administration and Congress includes many people who are opposed to sex education for minors and to contraception as well. That position is at odds with any policy to reduce abortions, here or abroad.

If they can't find an operator for a fee based system, then a subsidy will have to be discussed.  As for irate people, they said it will no longer be a rest area, so very simple to block off the lot, remove signage, & have a locked gate for shuttle & emergency vehicles only.  The article could have been more thorough, but my guess is the plan is just the outline given, & since it's open for 30 days of comment, go read it & comment in that venue, as your comments raise some valid points.

What twaddle:  Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has considerable knowledge of Russia from her journaism days; she speaks Russian fluently and, as demonstrated by her concluding the European trade deal, knows how to conduct herself in tough negotiations. She was appointed as Foreign Minister precisely because she can stand up to the Kremlin and, if necessary, to Trump. The Russians don't really know if the can trust Trump; he has no political experience, and by all indications, is too much of an egoist to learn much of anything. The Russian suggestion that they may lift sanctions against her travel to Russia suggests  that they may need an intelligent go-between because  Canada has always had privileged access to the American State Department. I suggest that Russia needs Canada far more than the other way round.

0,"Hi ATF,  I would support that approach towards seeking transitional deaconate for women which graduates to ordained priesthood, after a year, but not permanent deaconate.  We really need to get rid of the perm. deaconate.  It has always supported clericalism, sexism, racism, wealth disparity between nations, & even ethnic disparity.  The permanent deaconate, has consisted of 90% white, middle class or wealthier, western, married men, on a global scale, for the last 40 years. Most countries outside of the US, Europe & Canada have had lay men & women doing these functions, including baptisms.  ATF - why continue such a ministry at all?  Keeping a bad ministry or tradition in place just to give the false appearance of supporting women's equality while keeping women from actual equality is immoral.  The permanent deaconate needs to go and its ministries given to trained laity for the betterment of the church.  We need to ordain women priests & demand women cardinals now.

The 1% and their government stooges have used high tech, globalization, and immigrants as three giant red herrings to distract the workforce from the essential economic fact of corporate profit maximization and cost minimization. So, let's get this straight - the answer to why are workers' wages so low, why is the job market so punitive,  why is minimum wage not a livable wage, is simple - because greedy business folks want it that way. OK? That's grade school economics. So higher education for everybody is one solution - but contrarily the rich and powerful are doubling down and tripling down on university tuition in the US and Britain. So given all this BS, Brexit and the uprising of American workers is the only decent thing to do until corporations start raising wages and governments start lowering tuition fees. All right?

He selected his own original Cabinet based upon the strict demand that half of its composition be women. That is a form of quota.  Look, sorry, but when you have a leader at the helm who openly uses mathematical quotas for women versus men in his choices for positions of power, immediately that leads to taint, it leads to questions about the people he is choosing. Was the person really chosen because they are the best candidate, or was there a target number in play for women versus men?  Hey, I did not make this mess of a playing field, it was Justin Trudeau who did. I am simply asking the question needing to be asked, based upon the radical rules of play he has invoked.

Some conferences are more willing to utilize inculturation (which some commentators here all but call heresy) when in fact it is a principle of SC at VII.

The discrimination is absolutely everywhere, and much of it is so rooted into worldwide culture, that it literally will take a monumental intellectual shift to overcome it.  Certainly some cultures are ahead, but as an example culture via movies and television and economics, the USA has long served as the guide to the world on all cultural issues — sometimes unfortunately with gender bias against women being one of the worst.

Show me where they show you deductible is going to be the same amount for the same treatment while the policy cost less.  What I read constantly by supporters of the new plan is how the ACA was passed without knowing what was in it.  So the solution is to want another plan that you do not know what is in it.

0,"and yet us automakers knowingly defrauded american consumers involving the deaths of many drivers ass many as 240 died and 3000 injured  remember the ford explorer rollover scandal in which Ford execs ordered tire companies to manufacture a tire that would induce rollovers - only one company complained namely Firestone  where is Nasser now?  The Ford Explorer was first offered for sale in March 1990. Ford internal documents show the company engineers recommended changes to the vehicle design after it rolled over in company tests prior to introduction, but other than a few minor changes, the suspension and track width were not changed. Instead, Ford, which sets the specifications for the manufacture of its tires, decided to remove air from the tires, lowering the recommended pressure to 26 psi. Low air pressure leads to increased heat; heat can damage the tire. Firestone produced a tire that lead to high heat, tread loss and ultimately death for the occupants.

Clearly there was no discrimination in this case as the percentage of women hired greatly exceeded the percentage of women who applied. These same ratios are evident throughout my organization (which is an international high tech engineering organization), at all levels, including VPs. Furthermore, throughout the company I work with both men and women from every corner of the globe.  No credible organization is ever going to handicap itself by hiring or promoting anything less than the best people. If the best people are women or people from other cultures or of varying skin pigments, then those are the ones that will be hired. If women want equality with men, then they need to train for and pursue the same positions as men. It's that simple. This article lacks adequate data to be credible.

In fact, there continues to be no incentive to complete the project on time. It's the gift that keeps on giving. Has anyone asked why major penalties for non performance were not incorporated into the project? I can't recall one article on the subject of penalties to contractors. A large portion of the blame is dues to a one-party system of government. Furthermore, there is very little recourse for anyone opposing the project.

What bothers me is those who shamelessly exploit others and subscribe to the philosophy that the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.  That was the mantra when I was at university in the early 80s, and it brought Reaganomics, junk bonds, and irresponsible cuts, which were the gestation of the decline of the middle class and the increasing gap between rich and poor.  I have a comfortable lifestyle by dint of hard work.  But I don’t object to society helping those who aren’t as fortunate as I am; we weren’t all blessed with good health and reasonable intellect.  I don’t grumble too much about the taxes I have to pay, either – while I deplore the waste I see in government, I also see people who would have neither food nor shelter if it weren’t for publicly funded programs.

The future of the CPC seemed to be in the hands of power-hungry ideologues like Pierre Poilièvre and Jason Kenney.  I'm glad Justin Trudeau is PM. We need a centrist in power, not a Republican wrapped in the Canadian flag. So far, his approach has been balanced and pragmatic. The worst accusations opponents throw at him are sneers at how photogenic he is and rage about the Khadr settlement - an event made inevitable by 3 rulings against the government in the Supreme Court that affirmed beyond all doubt that Khadr's rights had been severely violated.

I consider that to be a radical right wing, deconstructive stance, nihilistic and anarchistic. I think I made that point in another post in the last day or two. My opinion is that if we want universal access to health care, only the federal government can do it properly, without the refusal of the individual states to care for their own. In addition, in order to control costs there has to be a national framework regulating best practices, licensure, and cost of imaging and pharmaceutical drugs.

Nor of the fact that the pipeline is already in place with the exception of the link to the Irving refineries in New Brunswick.  The fact that the approval process provides too many hoops for applicants to jump through that there can be no assurance that any investment can be justified has nothing to do with the cancellation is just impossible to swallow whole.

So the analogy doesn't work when you compare the polio vaccine to Iceland's """"solution"""".

0,"You do realize there are a lot of churches that provide free services to the homeless, youth, families, etc. and frequently to come to the aid of many people in our state that are homeless, jobless, addicted to drugs and alcohol, etc. Like Lela said, people donate money to churches to run programs and services that help people, not to line the pockets of a priest/pastor. Your argument is invalid as churches can lose their tax-free status if they engage in lobbying activities. They can't vote and can't shape anything, only educate their followers on religious doctrine; all they are asking is to continue with their traditions and practice of dogma that includes blessing and performing marriages between a man and a woman. If a same-sex couple wishes to marry, there are plenty of other options to tie the knot, and no one is being prohibited from *legal* marriage -- just a *religious* ceremony performed through a church that doesn't condone same-sex unions to protect rights of clergy.

There supposedly was evidence that Russian hackers had infiltrated computers at the DNC, but it is a very long stretch to say it was ordered by Putin and no hard evidence has yet been produced to prove it.  Have you seen any or are you just puppeting what Democratic Party leaders are saying?  I am not saying it did not happen.

0,"Another Oregon mill and forest owner (Longview Fiber recently sold their Oregon forests to a real estate investment trust) has sold their forestland to a global REIT and is selling their mill without its own forests to draw from.  Whoever buys Rosboro's mill will likely join other mills who've sold or liquidated their private forest to demand increased logging in public forests.  Meanwhile, the new owners will likely cut over what remains of Rosboro's hammered timber lands to pay off all or part of their acquisition costs.  This is becoming a common practice in Oregon, driven by the tax subsidies a REIT offers, global trade agreements, owners and markets focused on short term fiber production rather than long term timber production, and unrestricted harvest rates. It's a win for Wall Street and a loss for Oregon's timber work force and publicly owned forest resources like water, wildlife, and fisheries.  Reforming harvest taxes and the Forest Practice Act could slow the raiders!

Not only are we a critical trading partner (with lots of pressure points there) but the U.S. is very dependent on Canada for its security.  Think NORAD, Shiprider, border security, intelligence, access to our airspace and waters and similar military and security cooperation which gives the U.S. considerable strategic depth in reliance on the respect, trust and cooperation of a true friend to its north.  Canada is too often taken for granted in the U.S. generally and more specifically by the current administration.  There is no reason for us to get beat up at all in these negotiations if we stand firm and understand the pressures we can exert.

But it's hard to plead ignorance on that. Men only get one choice after conception: pay child support or go to jail.  Men shouldn't be forced to be a father just because they had sex. That doesn't mean they can tell a woman what to do with regards to her body if they get her pregnant, but they could declare they want no part (financial or otherwise) and be free of the obligation after conception.

And I get my information from many varied sources. And when I see something that draws my interest, I look further into it. Should I guess where you get your information? Naw, too easy.

0,"In 2006, the Palestinians held free and fair elections. To the horror of the West, they voted in Hamas who are considered by many to be terrorists. The reaction was swift. The Israeli army invaded the Gaza Strip arresting Hamas leaders and conducting air strikes to destroy infrastructure.  The Canadian government under Stephen Harper immediately cut off all ties to the Palestinians reducing aid. The Israelis continue to maintain a land and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip to the point of collapse without actually causing famine.  For all the talk of foreign influence in our elections, we should look at ourselves in the mirror and see if we're any better.

0,"I don't believe a building of the size proposed can be made """"quake proof"""". Buildings are designed to withstand a certain level of earthquake as expressed in the Richter scale. Each level increase from say 7 to 8 represents a 10 fold increase in energy. I would hope the City Council will debate the value of the extra cost for extra protection, not as the editorial implies, debating survivability versus immunity. It's been my impression that we've only seen increases in the estimated threat of a """"big one"""" over the last 30 years. My earthquake insurance cost reflects this. Thus consideration of a higher standard should be given. But it's misleading to claim the higher standard would make the building """"quake proof"""". Admittedly, the focus of the piece is on where the notion of increasing the earthquake standard came from. This will certainly create rumblings and fissures. It could add to the chasm between the public and the Council. If unresolved, aftershocks will effect other efforts.

Or, they are diagnosed with a medical condition and are not permited to work more than 19 hours a week. Some, PTSD (14% of homeless are Veterans) And Yes, it is really nice nice to report that we have a 2% unemployment rate, but why don't they report what the average pay rate is for having full time jobs in the full spread of employment here in Hawaii.

This  amounts to not much more than name calling in a pretty bow. Considering that: Canada is leading the G-7 in growth as the U.S. economy slows, and their dollar declines. The OECD, and Canada's banks speak in glowing terms about Canada's economic performance. Consumer spending, housing starts and a strong turnaround in business investment fuelled a 3.7 per cent annualized growth rate in the first quarter. As well, RBC chief economist Craig Wright said recently rising investment  has the economy on track to grow at nearly double the average pace of the previous two years.  And leaders from around the world have praised Trudeau-- especially for his handling of Trump. So: Who cares if he wears weird socks?

How long would it have taken them? The answer:  Eleven years. The proof:  Annual real property tax revenues have averaged approximately $900 million since 2006 (11 times $900 million is approximately $10 billion). The point: $10 billion is a bigger number than many people realize, and Honolulu's tax base is smaller.

Women's Priestly ordination might be voted to be allowed by our bishops in this age & would have possibly been so in the past too.  The law & tradition has never been fully accepted as correct, even by all bishops, in any age & it has no Gospel support which is why JPII was told he has no foundation to considered it an ex cathedra dogma & why he did not make it one.

Eventually, there will be no money to be made selling to the U.S., and the world will stop trying to sell to the U.S., and conversely, stop buying from the U.S, as well. Then the Wall Street sharks will have to exclusively feed off each other, causing a unstoppable downward spiral in the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will experience an economic drop from the loss of the U.S. market, but will recover after that initial loss is replaced by other trade agreements and markets. Hopefully, the end result will be that the initial economic drop will be the last global economic problem caused by the U.S., as they were responsible for the 2007 recession, and more than their fair share of previous recessions.

0,"Nice little tidbit. I'm sure you analyzed the company's  balance sheet, right?  Net Debt / EBITDA in 2014 was 9.6 times. The estimate for the same ratio for 2016 is 4.7 times.  So the company's net debt to EBITDA has been more than cut in half. And amazingly, somehow the company survived in the past when debt levels were much higher! It's called the appropriate use of leverage.  Did you bother to look to see how much of this debt is fixed and how much is variable? Or what the average term to maturity of the company's debt is? Fixed-rate, long-term debt is esentially unaffected by changes in interest rates.  Remember that 40 years ago, a $100,000 mortgage may very well have been considered high. Today in most cases, it would be next to nothing. Looking at debt in isolation won't tell you a whole lot and more likey will be misleading. Or, """"a little knowledge can be a dangerous thting.""""

It's a supply and demand model that works through the demand for public transit. Riderwise. How many riders will choose to ride depends on price, time of commute, the price of using private cars including commute time. The most important variable is population along the line. And that needs to be 600,000.  Busroutes are being reconfigured so that the bus is part of a networked public transportation system. Traffic congestion is killing the bus in its current configuration. Late arrivals are skyrocketing, time spent idling is increasing fuel costs. Finally like the bus rail will be heavily subsidized. There is no break even point in the conventional sense of the term. As to the time of the estimate, if anything the conditions underlying ridership will lead to more rather than less.

Measure 5 should have stipulated what cuts the state could make and/or where to obtain the funds the measure demanded the state provide to schools.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but he did not appear to say anything offensive toward the fallen american soldier who is a hero, and Trump referred to him as a hero.  He was just asking a reasonable question about the silence of the mother of the soldier, knowing that the Islamic religion forbids women to speak, and that the subjugation of women is something the militant Islamics wish to impose on america's women.   It is religious legalism, which is the foundation of Islam, that has no empathy towards women.   I could also see Mr. Trump's genuine empathy when responding to their own attacks  Only when pressed to do so did the muslim parents denounce terrorism.  They are mistaken.

They could continue with how great and """"free"""" America is, along with their meritocracy-equality fantasy drivel.

If “he doesn't need to” supposes there is no bona-fide question, the numerous articles in every Catholic media about conflicting interpretations that are diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive contradict you.  2) While there may be a variety of opinions on a matter of doctrine, once the matter is decided these less-than-magisterial opinions count for naught.

If ENI, Armstrong, Great Bear, & other emerging Players could speak freely and with no fear of retaliation by the Troika that constitutes Komrad Oil in Alaska, they would tell you about anti-competitive machinations by the Troika. They would tell you about kickback schemes and racketeering in their negotiations with the Troika to get access to stranded reserves. They would come clean about cost allocation schemes affecting tariffs and taxes among the Trioka. Alaska is handicapped as a regulator and a partner in this game where the Directorate of Komrad Oil plots and schemes against the interests of the People. And thanks to the toady complicity of the Republikanskaya, the only institution with the power to bring the Troika to heel is toothless and clawless.  All Hail Komrad Oil!

1,"Problem:  The deluded and corrupt fools leading the legislative majorities have a lock on power because they keep getting reelected by their loyal but clueless constituents, largely due to gerrymandered districts.  The rest of us can't vote them out of office if we're not in their districts.  Solution:  Take the majority away from them.  How?  By voting out any of your own legislators that are in the majority.  Even though they might be reasonably good reps, if they're in the majority, they're part of the problem because they empower the likes of Chenault and his cronies.  If you don't like what this legislature is doing, you need to sacrifice your own reps to fix it.

And the federal Liberals, as usual, have created another layer of complexity that allows them to once again increase the size of government to manage it.  Will be interesting to see if this becomes a wedge issue in the 2019 election, with the choices being no carbon tax (most CPC candidates), a well-designed tax (if Chong wins - longshot), or a poorly designed and expensive tax (Trudeau/McKenna).

However, there is a much bigger issue and that is what to do with the one or two million parents and non-DACA siblings of DACA immigrants.

For example, if the cost of running the city is $100, the 2017 cost schedule is for $102, the mill rate will be adjusted to reflect a tax revenue of not $102 but $102.50.  This is an entirely sneaking way of increasing the cost burden on the taxpayer beyond requirements by picking up an extra dollar to spend.

Nobody rigged it special for Sanders.  Yes, Clinton legitimately won the votes according to longstanding party rules, but there's no way to deny that that outcome was engineered as a matter of longstanding party policy.

Remember the protests at town halls in Sep 2009?  Still have the dopey hat with the tea bags hanging off of it?  The Senate passed the ACA on March 21, 2010, with President Obama signing it March 23, 2010.  Hundreds of hours were spent on the ACA, hundreds of OPEN meetings and committee hearings.  Americans KNEW what it was before it passed.  Comparing what is happening now to what happened then is a specious argument.

That projection, however, depends on the assumption that sub-Saharan Africa's total fertility rate (TFR, the average number of children per woman) will decline from 5.1 to approximately 3.0 by 2050. That decline, in turn, assumes that the use of family planning in the region will rise significantly. But recent surveys from many sub-Saharan African countries have indicated that TFR decline is either slower than projected or is not taking place at all. Only 20 percent of married women in sub-Saharan Africa use a modern form of family planning, the lowest rate in the world. PRB population Reference Bureau

Even if he was convicted previously,and since DUI is a misdemeanor in Cali, his Colorado conviction couldn't be considered as we don't have a misdemeanor reciprocal sentencing-enhancement agreement with California. That being said, a conviction in California can be considered against his Colorado Probation as terms of probation in Colorado require that the probatee not be convicted of any local, state, or Federal offense in any jurisdiction anywhere in Colorado or in any other state. Since his conviction occurred in August of 2015, he would be within the 2 year window; However, Arapahoe County offers early probation termination if the probatee has complied with all terms and conditions of probation AND if all fees and fines are paid in full. The probatee can apply for this relief after 1/2 of the sentence is completed - so he may already be off-paper in Colorado.

Endocannabinoids are the only neurotransmitters known to engage in “retrograde signaling,” a unique form of intracellular communication that inhibits immune response, reduces inflammation, relaxes musculature, lowers blood pressure, dilates bronchial passages, increases cerebral blood flow (a rush of thoughts!), and normalizes overstimulated nerves. Retrograde signaling serves as an inhibitory feedback mechanism that tells other neurotransmitters to cool it when they are firing too fast (213).  Prostate cancer: Researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that the administration of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN-55,212-2, a CB-1 and CB-2 agonist, inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and also induced apoptosis (programmed cell death, a good thing where cancer cells are concerned). - Martin A.

But not all religions feel that way.  To me, restricting access to abortion is a type of religious restriction that maybe shouldn't come from the government.  He also withheld funding to Planned parenthood because one of their clinics in Kansas provides abortion services, even though 95% of what they provide is health care for women.  That is one way he is restricting religious freedom, by forcing his own views on the whole state.    When I see him go to communion, I about throw up in my mouth because he is so horrible in my eyes (personal opinion R & R).    I happen to play the organ at the church he attends most of the time.

Thousands of accused were railroaded by the Title IX fiasco. Preponderance of the evidence means 51 out of 100 or one more coin flip that you called.  When crimes are committed, there's the criminal justice system. If a victim can't seek redress with the criminal justice system, there's civil proceedings. Both systems are designed to ensure fair and impartial proceedings. Universities completely abrogated any shred of morality by their Title IX Witch Hunts.

That is a fact, and nothing about that stated fact violates this paper's civility rules.  It is a fact that research has shown that many houses bought in those cities were purchased in the names of overseas-origin students studying for example at UBC, the money being a way for their rich overseas parents to park some of the family money in the haven of Canadian real estate. Ottawa's new plan amounts to a way around the recently introduced tax penalties against foreign purchases, it is a way around that.  Ottawa should focus more on helping Canadians who work at jobs in Canada to buy homes in those cities.

0,"I have read his plan. The problem is that it ignores economic reality. NOTHING is for free. Someone always has to pay for the """"free"""" stuff. When it's just a little bit of """"free"""" stuff (like what we had up until the 1960s), we could tax the rich and corporations (though companies pass that cost onto their customers, you realize?) and the middle class didn't feel the pinch, though they started to feel it when private medical costs were driven higher by Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and when college tuition started hiking because of Pell grants. But when you start offering a great deal more """"free"""" stuff, taxes have to become much more broadly based ... meaning the middle class will see their taxes go up, not down. Research England and the Scandanavian countries to learn the truth about taxes in socialist """"utopias"""". It's not pretty. The American Founders would have called it tyranny.

It took all those millions of dollars for the jury to convict him, and then promptly send him to prison for life. Ultimately, Brauchler's game of chicken cost everyone a ton of money, time, and forced the victims' families to re-live the horror for many years. Here, the defense - via the family, is already planting the same seeds regarding his mental health. I wonder if Dave Young will be a better pragmatist than Brauchler.

Remember that Jan Smuts lost his """"safe"""" UP seat in the 1948 elections.

Such idiocy would be salvageable IFF: 1) the Quran did not have passages that endorse precisely what the """"extremists"""" do, or 2) there were such a hue and cry among peaceful Muslims against terrorists as to leave no mistake that modern Islam rejects the Quran on this subject.   Neither of these two conditions obtain.  Thus, McElroy is a naive, false prophet.

1,"Hey Scott, you didn't """"strike a nerve."""" You made an incredibly dumb proposition and received the appropriate backlash for proposing something so stupid.  1) The revenues from your proposal wouldn't even be enough to cover the costs of administering it, so you'd cost the taxpayers more rather than enhance road/highway funding.  2) Nearly all cyclists also have vehicles, so they pay the same taxes as everyone else. Your proposal is stupidly punitive, singling out a group whose actions benefit our society and automobile drivers.  3) Colorado's image as an outdoor recreation Mecca, which includes being a cycling friendly state, is a huge economic draw. It's one of the reasons we won the outdoor retailer show away from Utah. Your idiotic proposal is counter-productive to the development of Colorado's outdoor-based economy.  That you were shocked by the backlash only further demonstrates how ignorant and out of touch you are.

However, the cost of living is low in Cuba, and obesity is rare. Now Trump wants to curtail travel to and from Cuba, and continue the embargo to some degree. This will hurt the Cuban people, who need Yanqui dollars and Yanqui trade to prosper. Cuba probably has a higher real literacy rate than does the US, and Cuba's inclusive education policy for all shows how much Cuba values education, not how much Cuba can afford to pay its teachers.

Effective to well beyond 25 yards against a non-armoured opponent- depending on officer ability of course. No substitute for a rifle, though.  And I believe the urgent call for carbines went out after the Mayerthorpe, AB murder of four officers in 2005 by a man with a rifle.  Planning and acquisition take time, but 6 years for approval and still no product by 2014 is utterly unacceptable.

In Florida and Arizona, Canadian snowbirds do not have thousands of parachute/astronaut families where their kids get public school and health care paid for by taxes of the local American workers.  The two situations, Canadian snowbird money into USA and money from China into Vancouver, are different. Canadians buying occasional-use winter houses in the USA is NOT a Vancouver-like situation.  And by the way, """"in 2016, Chinese buyers were the largest by dollar volume, pumping in an estimated $27 billion into US real estate. Canadians were a distant second, spending $8.9 billion"""".

However, when it comes to Washington DC, it is likely that Kim Jong Un will (also) want a surface attack. If Kim Jong Un makes such a nuclear attack, he will want to see Washington DC wiped from the face of the planet.  It is my opinion that it is this determination that has kept such attack from already happening.  That should have been a lesson from 9/11 in giving enemies centralized targets, and if it were smart, the USG should have been decentralized a long time ago.  In our modern world, there is no need for every federal government agency to have a HQ in Washington DC.

Further more, we don't pay attention to what bishops say. We just don't, but we do listen to our neighbors and family members who felt Trump would bring jobs back to the United States.

Your reliance on the old testament is a sure sign of desperation.  The fact is, Jesus never defended himself, and neither did his followers for hundreds of years.  He never advocated violence, in self defense, or in the defense of others.  He seemed to rely solely on God, and expect his followers to do the same.  You rely upon one line of gospel for your advocacy of military might.  While your argument may be logical, that does not necessarily mean it is Christian.  Jesus may very well have expected his followers to be total pacifists and he may very well have expected his followers to endure martyrdom.  They did for the first centuries, and the Word spread.

I would argue that reduction of the labour force will happen anyway. It is already.  Also the idea that everyone will simply choose not to work is unfounded. Evidence from earlier pilot programs have shown that many choose to go back to school, volunteer or contribute to the arts. Few actually sit on their buts.  The fact remains that automation is eroding working and middle class jobs. Not everyone can be an engineer or programmer. I don't know if guaranteed income, or shorter work week, is the solution but I applaud the government for testing potential solutions.  What is your idea Eric?

Film Botany of Desire, free at YouTube, reports that for the prior 50 years the best botany scientists focused on only increasing marijuana's mind elevating THC%.

Also very different is THCA, acid of the raw flowers/leaves which can be juiced and consumed in large amounts because THC is activated only by heat. Medicine has much to learn.

Increasing the minimum wage will increase worker income, consumer spending, spur more investment, and reduce demand on social programs. Who says this? For one, the head of Citi Bank, as well as the heads of several other major banks, including big Walll Street investment banks. Trump said this during his campaign although it is not clear where he is going now because of horse trading with the Repbuclicans. However, some of his advisors are saying that increasing the minimum wage goes hand in hand with his new deficit spending budget by insuring that corporate tax breaks go to employees (and not just to shareholders and management or buying back stock) to spur more growth in income and thereby spur even more consumer spending and investment economic growth.

Would protesters rather have the oil companies ship the oil by trucks and trains that will use lots of gasoline and diesel fuel and emit lots of greenhouse gases that will help to hasten climate change?

They don't want to be Protestant, because despite what they claim, they know that the Protestant Church isn't the real deal.  The only way they can generate interest in their publication is by associating with the only Church that really counts: the Roman Catholic Church.  That is cheating--but it is a bit of a left handed compliment to the Catholic Church. This is also a left handed compliment to the American way: they want to make money.  The way to do that is to market a publication that is clearly not Catholic as a Catholic one.  Despite what liberals claim, they like capitalism.

The point is most smokers started young, started with light type cigarettes, moved on to Camels and when one an hour was not enough, they ramped up to chain smoking and now many are dead and many we are taking care of.

They would lose their license to practice if they did.  It should be illegal for the government to force it on EVERYONE without consent.

They only revealed their true intentions at the 2nd public design meeting, on the 10th of December.

0,"Regarding: """"I wish that other institutions, for example public schools, would be only one-tenth as good as the RCC is. """" - Such a comparison reminds all that crime and sin have no limits. - However, school & district boards, the secular press, and courts have been documenting publicly any known facts about the rape of children and molestation of young people by school or district faculty and staff for decades longer than episcopacy had done in the US and elsewhere in the world. - The US episcopacy would not report these high crimes and misdemeanors, while this generally was not the case for secular educational institutions. - The chief difference being that for secular boards and school leadership there is little incentive to practice 'omerta'. However, until recently, the omerta practices of the US episcopacy were well in place and practiced for centuries. Omerta is at the core of the scandal of episcopal secrecy in the US and throughout the world.

The referendum is about a significant  reduction of the Senate role and giving more seats in the Parlament to a winning party. Absolutely similar to the Canadian situation, don't you think? The difference is that to pass this law both houses should have a constitutional majority support (two third majority ) and if not a referendum should take place. AMAZING,right?  At the same time the Liberals in Canada are afraid of the referendum on the electoral reform. Loosing this kind of the referendum would mean a rulling party support is lower than they heralded. This would mean the Prime Minister to resign, in Italy, not in Canada.

0,"Speaking as a landlord I can tell you that eviction is not a desired or favored outcome by a landlord. It costs a lot more than the legal fees. Loss of rent and almost always a unit involved in an eviction requires extensive repairs and cleaning. In many cases the debris left behind can be a major expense to remove and dispose of.  But landlords have learned that if a tenant falls behind on the rent it is smart to move aggressively to get them out. Once a tenant falls behind they rarely to never get caught up. In fact, once they have established the landlord will show leniency the tenant tends to become far more casual about paying on time, if at all.  The net effect of making it harder to evict a non-paying or problem tenant will be landlords screening prospective tenants more closely and accepting only the most creditworthy with pristine background checks.

0,"Part 2: Whether the bishops can ever fully understand just how condescending, how dismissive their position may be on women, I think we live in a society where we are more and more focused on what to do with the time we have.  That awareness of time is gonna work against the church, and as has been noted, will lead to that smaller church.    The question I keep circling back to  is whether smaller is really better.  I think not.  At the end of the day, the church will need to undergo a massive change if it is to remain the kind of force in society that it seems to want to be.  It cannot get there by demeaning half the population, and holding the rest in a sense of servitude.  Either the church is a community of Christians, trying to find its way, or it's a tops down organization modeled off of the court of Constantine.  it can't be both and be successful.  So in that context, I think the """"days of our lives"""" becomes an important factor.

Once it has landed in the last predator on the food-chain and that animal dies, so does any chance of it infecting any further animals. Kill all cats and T. gondii goes completely bye-bye from that ecosystem.  And to further correct your misinformation, it can survive about 1.5 years in soils and 4.5 in waters. If all cats are dead, they can't replenish that source of T. gondii with new oocysts, so it disappears from the environment too in no more than 4.5 years.

The so-called """"investment"""" was generally real estate plays.  So whilst the BC Liberals have been front and centre pretending concern re housing affordability for working families, the back door has been shovelling out money used for RE speculation that is running up the cost of homes.  And the BC Liberal spin machine is working - the media runs stories and op-eds on distractions like the BC Liberals posturing on softwood and coal - and the noise drowns out the Liberals costly backroom shenanigans.

Catalan is absent from most Spanish government signage in Catalonia; the provision of central government services in Catalan is not guaranteed; and Catalan has all but disappeared from state television. Catalan may not be used in the lower house of the Spanish legislature. Catalans cannot identify Catalan with the state, and must contend, in politics and state administration, with a glass ceiling. No Catalan has served as a head of government in Spain since the 1870s. No Catalan has served as speaker of the lower house under the 1978 constitution.

Secular progressive liberals, who consistently bash and attack the Jewish, Christian and Catholic faiths, who consistently insist religion has no place in a modern and secular society, who consistently bashed and closed down the office of religious freedoms, are now all-of-a-sudden interested in more legislation, that essentially does what several other discrimination and hate crime laws (and the charter) already does and thus increase the protection for one particular religious faith, but not the others.  All in response to the tragic attack on a Mosque by a known Jack Layton/ NDP supporter.  And, when conservatives want to expand the law to include all faiths, and protect a fundamental charter right that is freedom of speech, and freedom of religion, liberals accuse them of watering down the law in some devious and cynical political ploy.

If NK is desperate and launches waves of fighters to overwhelm deployed US/SK aircraft (US will probably know this is coming due to positioning by NK observed by intelligence assets), but perhaps they will probably be  able to do some damage before being totally shot down, but that assumes that the US/SK Air force has a prepared contingency to also launch waves of fighters in a timely manner, as a response.  The B-1 bombers are only capable of carrying non-nuclear weapons now (don't think they can even carry nuclear-armed cruise missiles under their wings like B-52s}, but can carry precision weapons which can still be punishing for ground targets, but the NK SAMs might then come into play.

It's our responsibility here, in the most environmentally-aware region of the US, to ask hard questions about what an appropriate response to the crisis is NOW, today, when  AGW has almost certainly played a role in the storms and fires of this terrible summer.  I guess we can't expect the RG to lead on this, given that to about 40% of Americans, even here, AGW is akin to some arcane conspiracy like the theory that NASA faked the moon landings or that the Clintons ran a child prostitution ring out of a DC pizza joint.  All that aside, we are now at the point when we should ask what criminal charges should be brought against long time deniers like Exxon and the Koch Brothers. Research that!

It is simply a convenient time to make a statement that he/she may be asked about by a reporter.  It is not unusual for a person with a podium to do or say something in protest. The fact that it does not influence many people one way or the other does not make them  SOB's.  Trump should have said nothing at all but he decided to call them names and also said they should be fired. Most of the new support they have is by players who are simply reacting to Trump's comments.  Aside from getting a round of applause at a rally of die hard supporters, he only made matters much worse.

The Fosters' grievance against Cardinal Pell is well substantiated and given enormous publicity in this city, and, indeed, in Australia as a whole. Also, no-one who knows Pell was surprised by their accusation of coldness and arrogance and lack of empathy. And it certainly wasn't the only similar accusation. Pell definitely preferred to force people to bring complaints to a court of law, which, in Australia at least, is very adversarial. As Archbishop of Sydney, he was able to marshal the financial resources of the Church against John Ellis, for example. (John Ellis tried to complain to the Archdiocese about his childhood abuse at the hands of a priest. Pell's response was 'Prove it in court"""", opening the way for the Church to actually attack a victim via its wealth and its lawyers). In other words, you're right!

There is no moral reasoning (because you can’t justify eating your young).  I don’t deny that fixing this will hurt. Hangovers hurt. But trying to drink them away only makes them bigger – and it’s what we’ve been doing for years. Every little measure the government does to “help buyers” now is the same as trying to drink away a hangover.

I think there is truth in what you say about why God becoming human chose a male body - because it was necessary in the culture of those times if SHe was to be listened to at all.  I think it is also a statement of our own times that referring to God or God in Jesus as female, or not acknowledging his male body brings such a vitriolic response.  That vitriolic response points to the truth of another statement you made:  """"After 2,000 years women continue to be viewed as property, and most vehemently so with respect to that which (perhaps) most definitively makes them women, their reproductive bodies.""""  Power is equated with being male.  Leo Sprietsma started this comment string with a good question: can we learn and change if new knowledge shows us what we once thought was true is either incomplete or wrong?  It appears not many folks can even discuss the idea.  Kevin Walters gave a link in his comment to an excellent article which I recommend.

0,"In the Franciscan tradition of theology, Jesus became incarnate out of Love, not only to 'redeem' from sin. We all, individually and as 'humanity' collectively,  have quite enough sins of our own that need redemption, don't you think?  Of course, personally, I never quite understand this Jewish --- and many other religions -- fascination with blood sacrifice, and the idea that that pleases God or is demanded by God. Ideally it's supposed to be actual human sacrifice, though Jews at least allowed substitutions. Makes for a weird sort of God, to my mind.  But that's what the prophets said a 'messiah' had to do, so Jesus went along with it.  Baptism as remission of personal sin would seem to be what Jesus had in mind. Jewish people had no understanding of 'original sin' as something inherited -- that idea came in with St. Paul.  There is no 're-imagined' original sin. That's the point. Jesus' death and resurrection has better reasons than dealing with a non-existent imaginary 'sin'.

Now that it is competitive Mike has had to listen to and represent everyone in the district - including Hispanics and immigrants that now make a large portion of his constituency.

If you subtract California's votes from both candatites, Hillary would be loosing the popular vote by almost 3.5 million votes. The electoral college was put in place to keep higher density populations from having absolute control over everyone. I'm sure it doesn't seem fair in the minds of the current loser, but it was established to create a balance. See we are a representative republic, similar to a democracy. A democracy is nothing more than two wolves and a lamb deciding what's for dinner. Do you really want California to be deciding our laws for us?

That is where the real power is because the SCOTUS has the power of judicial review.  Through that power they can toss laws at will and create laws at will. There is no check or balance against the SCOTUS save a Constitutional amendment and they are difficult to get passed. The justices are not accountable to anything or anyone.

Yet, only about $221 million of this has been distributed to NANA shareholders during this time. (N.B.  All these numbers are directly from the NANA website)   Somewhere about $260 million has been used to cover the losses of their other “businesses”.

Trump must be consigned to private life: he has no place in any public office.

Or if he did it, he could have apologized and paid for the crime.  Some of these comments are even blaming the victim, e.g. """"What a shame.

IMHO we do not need an """"Archbishopric of the Military Services."""" As a veteran of military service from the Vietnam era, I can assure the good bishop that there is nothing compatible between being a person licensed to kill and living an authentic Christian life. Pope Francis should send a message by abolishing this Archbishopric, and Broglio should sign up for an authentic ministry, such as ministry to prisoners or undocumented persons locked up in detention centers by Donald Trump' s ICE.

I do not believe that BLM as an organization advocates violence against police, that like any organization, there maybe members who have gone further than the core beliefs in statement or in action.

0,"So apparently because President Trump fired James Comey for not making it public that the President was not being investigated in the Russian collusion fiasco, among other reasons that are quite obvious, as also it has now been discovered that Comey was also a leaker of confidential material to the media.  So now besides the Russian collusion fiasco of fake and unproven news, we're now going to switch to obstruction of justice fiasco, as no investigation has been stopped, but because of Comey's previous mistakes as itemized in the DOJ's memos advising President Trump to fire Comey, as well as Comey not making it public that President Trump was not being investigated in the Russian collusion case.  Makes a lot of sense, and shows that the Democrats are still running the federal government with the help and aid of the liberal biased media, and Mueller, with his very liberal lawyer friends, a witch-hunt searching for a crime to prosecute.

Aside from all of the voluntary layoffs that started last year, involuntary layoffs of engineers and other union and non-union employees are occurring right now and there will be many more job losses over the next two years. The writing was on the wall when Boeing published their 100 year anniversary brochure. There was a two page center spread photo of the Charleston assembly line. There was barely a mention of the Everett assembly line.  Yes indeed, Boeing has totally mislead and used the tax payers in Washington State.

It's also a bit patronizing of you to think that even though other religious followers, notably Christians, can approach their holy books with a modern viewpoint, adjusting their religious observances accordingly, yet you seem to think that Muslims must all march in lockstep, following the Koran to the letter.  And following on our recent exchange about your demand that all Muslims prove their loyalty, have you asked your non-Muslim neighbour if his reasons for not attacking you are legal or ethical?

One can argue whether this is right or wrong or the norm is outdated, but it is still present in our society.  Much like the Pledge of Allegiance used to be, reverence to the flag is probably on its way out.  Last, consider what might happen in a soccer stadium in Columbia or Brazil if one dissed the flag.

If Cole cared about Alaska he'd ask the real question : Who is better for Alaska , Trump or Clinton ?  There is no comparison.   Trump through throttling the EPA would allow the human life saving King Cove emergency road . He's allow more drilling . With our economy sinking , he'd open up mining across Alaska . He'd allow logging again in the southeast where tree's are rotting where they stand.  His plan to rebuild our military would be a gigantic boost for our economy.  Alaska would become great again under Trump .   Clinton on the other hand would expand and build on Obama's excessive federal over reach . Consider  what Clinton would do with Cole's Fairbanks fireplace smoke issues. She'd ban wood burning. Clinton would be Alaska's worst nightmare.  Every Alaskan should support Trump .  Why doesn't Cole ?  Who's side is he on ? Clearly not Alaska's.

With production at 25%, and prices at 25%, we're currently at 1/16th of our previous income levels.  So, to return to your """"home budget"""" analogy, let's make it accurate:  Your family is a single-income family, and you've just been fired.  (i.e. you've just lost your single source of revenue). According to your analogy, looking for a new source of revenue is not the answer.  So what is? """"stop feeding the pigs""""? Instead of looking for a new job, you're just going to stop going to the movies and stop dining out? Those items you mention are less than one-tenth of one-percent of the state spending. Getting rid of them sounds great on paper, but solves absolutely nothing.  Sorry.  The only solution is to go get a new job. Putting that in state terms: we need new and different sources of revenue.

0,"Yet another Walker / democrat money grab.  Walker thinks the oilies owe $131 million and applies another $63 million in interest.  Yet via his vetoes of oil credits owed to the producers, the State of Alaska owes them in the vicinity of $700 million in the other direction, a difference approaching $500 million.  Perhaps Walker is simply trying to decrease the size of check to be written by the State for tax credits.  Cheers -

I'm not saying that people of color are more prone to crime or some ish like that but you aren't taking in the entire picture here for people of color.

This action, based on lies, puts our loved ones in the military at risk, puts people we're protecting in distant lands at risk, and puts our very freedom and safety as a nation at risk.

First they should emphasize that no gender may resort to violence. Second they should acknowledge that men and women equally own the problem.

0,"Part of the reason for the drop in sales activity, is not just the 15% foreign buyers tax - but the fact that the tax now comes with stronger identity verification, compliance,  and tracking.  This is a deterrent for that sector of the market purchasing with overseas sourced/earned income that did not want to be verified or reported.  Given the annual double digit increases in property value, 15% is the removal of one year's worth of appreciation - not that big a factor for getting your money out of one country and into another.  Unless you don't want the closer scrutiny.  Regardless, low sustainable, is an entire city that is ranked as the least affordable to purchase vis a vis income in North America.

We have had presidents who were soft spoken, gentlemanly and diplomatic. Now look at our modern politicians.

But pastoral councils [as opposed to parish councils concerned with festivals, dinners, broken boilers and the physical condition of the church] have been 'tabled' in many parishes, since the year 2000.  Pastoral councils were broken down to different committees which dealt with liturgy, evangelization, hospitality, stewardship, faith formation, prayer life, service opportunities, communication tools, finances, and committed discipleship issues.  The pastoral council encouraged people to use their talents within the parish, more than the ability to shake the head 'yes' when the pastor wanted an affirmative decision and then, to shake the head 'no' when the pastor wanted a negative response.

With no risk to their investment in government-backed mortgages, the banks have a government-created incentive to focus on mortgage lending and not on SME lending.  This has resulted in the allocation of capital away from more productive uses such as business investment, reducing Canada’s productivity rate and diminishing long-term prosperity.  In short, banks would rather invest in mortgages at no risk to themselves, leaving all the risk with taxpayers, rather than financing small and medium-sized businesses.

There is no modern parallel to the regressive ideology of political Islamism - which is highlighted by the division and societal regression in Europe over the last 15 years (or Turkey over the last 8).  It would be naive to believe good intentions and hoping for the best would keep Canada immune from the same issues in Europe.  Gender equality is not a function of cultural relativism and is more important than accommodating regressive beliefs under the guise of religion. Canada didn't evolve into one of the most advanced societies in the world by accident - we should be weary of accommodating cultural practices that are only common in countries where women are forced to submit to male authority and free expression is non-existent.

No decent person would empathize with their agenda. That said, there is a growing propensity to discriminate against white people in the pursuit of equality and to disparage their perceived privilege. The Liberal/left/progressive penchant for social atonement for historic injustices perpetrated against non-whites is resented by current generations who had no responsibility for these misdeeds. The fact is, however, that the Charlottesville incident was not the forum for this dissatisfaction or representative of any norm. Race relations have never been better and the vast majority of Americans are not about to tolerate a return to the ugliness of yesteryear.

If you can't stand and show your respect then maybe you need to find a country that better meets your needs, if they will take you.  As for your freedom of speech, you are entitled to that but not when you are being paid for your services. If you feel the need to express your personal opinions you may do so during your personal time in a manner that doesn't impose on others. Ticket payers are there to watch a game not a protest.

The fear, based on our own intelligence and that of the Russians, Germans, and Israeli’s, was that Saddam was manufacturing his own WMDs.  He’d already tried to manufacture nukes until the Israeli’s destroyed his capacity to do so.  (See Operation Opera).  And with Scud Missile technology, he had a delivery system that threatened the entire region. And we still don’t know for certain that he wasn’t manufacturing chemical or biological agents.

What will they do if Trump asks them to bomb North Korea or China with nuclear bombs? These generals occupy ministerial posts normally headed by civilian ministers to supervise the military. With them, Trump can behave like a dictator and give them orders they are supposed to obey. On his own, Trump could plunge the world into a nuclear war.

0,"In my experience so far, most of his supporters are left-wing liberals. Peterson is defending the principles of liberal democracy and the Civil Rights Movement, against neo-Marxists who pretend to speak for others, subscribe to postmodern, social constructionist, and Marxist ideas about people and society, and use authoritarian rhetoric and techniques to try to shut people down by smearing them with unwarranted labels, redefining words to mean different things, mobbing people, and censoring them.  These people are not the liberal left. They are the authoritarian left. They have naively replaced the class struggle of proletariat and bourgeoisie with the """"marginalized"""" vs """"majority/dominant"""", and called it the Progressive Stack. It is not only a bad analogy, but also fails how humans and society work, fails liberalism, commits fallacy of division and base rate fallacy, and it treats people by identity group, not individual merit; by colour of skin, not content of character.

0,"I am essentially saying the same thing, but you seem to take some offense to it. When Harper made appointments he was making appointments that government routinely fills. So again as your words indicate, government makes lots of these appointments, or in a ten year period thousands of them. When Harper made appointments it was called the Harper government. When Chretien made appointments it was called the Chretien government. The current usage tends to be the Liberal government rather then the Trudeau government. Of course Harper was partisan in his appointments, as was Mulroney, Chretien and so on. Often its just the way it is, as there are a fair number of people qualified who are Liberal or Conservative. The Liberal government has let a number of appointments slide and there is currently a backlog of positions to be filled. At the current rate of appointments and including the backlog, the Liberal government will match Harper if they are in for ten years.

Before screwing Bernie Sanders and his followers, HRC was busted for gross negligence with classified material. Her rapist hubby put the squeeze on AG Loretta Lynch and imagine that! No indictment! Ask anyone in the military or the federal government what would happen if they did the same thing as Mrs. Clinton. Throw in another investigation of the Clinton Foundation aka Clinton Slush Fund. Elizabeth Warren? Hee! What a joke. Pretended to be a Native American because her grandfather said she had """"high cheek bones."""" Mrs. Warren used her """"minority"""" status to get a cushy teaching job at Harvard, which advertised her phony Native American heritage. Leftists claim that Trump is a misogynist but that is easily blown apart with his record of putting competent women in charge of projects.

It is with what attendees have said happened at them, namely unregistered lobbying efforts that reek of bad optics and even corruption, given that the Liberals are essentially the government, given their majority.  The other issue is what has taken down many powerful people, namely, lying about what is happening at the parties.  The Liberals said that no lobbying occurs at these party fundraisers, which is not the case.  Frankly, when the Liberals compaigned on being the different, accountable and ethical choice, who cares about what the other parties in a minority position that can't direct policy did or are doing?

But let's say it is; the same prognosticators of global doom will also tell you that there's nothing that man can do to reverse what has been done in any reasonable period of time.  Meanwhile, the US is one of the lowest polluters in the world.  If you're worried about global warming, move from the hurricane zones and the coasts.

0,"@argyle5663: Great post.  I would add this: we live in a democracy and, while far from perfect, policies will reflect to some degree the popular will.  The participation rate in Canadian real estate has grown to about 70%. Nearly 1/3 of BC's GDP is based on real estate/construction (with other provinces also showing huge growth in these sectors). What I'm saying is that those realities span the net worth and/or employment of a lot of people. A huge swath of people (in particular recent buyers and those who are under-prepared for retirement!) want this outcome, long-term consequences be darned. What politician - at any level or at any point on the left or right - is going to suggest policy that would alienate such a large number of people?  Answer thus far: pretty much none of them.  But just because a majority of people want something in present, doesn't mean its even close to a good idea long-term. No one is entitled to own and no one is entitled to real estate gains.

Your denial just shows how comfortable you are with the benefits your white skin gives. The denial of the roll of white racism in every aspect of this country is itself, a white privilege.
