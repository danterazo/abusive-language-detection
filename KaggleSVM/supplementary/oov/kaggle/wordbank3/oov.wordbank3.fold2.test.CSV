0,"I am so sick of this stereotype against white males. Look at Trump's rallies. Who are all of those women-like folks? This country is sinking under the weight of stereotypes and divisiveness. Yup, a lot of white guys are voting for Don the Con, but there are a lot of us white guys who aren't. Every time we label folks, we hang stereotypes on those labels.

0,"Ms. Shride's posting seems fairly innocuous. Not sure why it would lead to the school superintendent's actions that could have cost her two jobs. Regardless of what her  personal feelings about the number of off island students commuting to the island may be (which she is entitled to) she is very careful with the students. As a walk on I have often observed her and the other ferry workers on  Vashon making sure the students get on and off and stay to the side, keeping them safe. In fact students and ferry workers seem quite friendly with each other. WSF's investigation on the complaint cleared her. The settlement seems appropriate and hopefully this will be the end of it.

0,"Somehow your sanctimonious finger-wagging rings hollow.  People are allowed to be both sad and angry at this horrrific event.  This is not an """"either-or"""" matter.  Those poor """"soles"""", as you put it, would be alive or uninjured today if the gun lobby weren't so much in control of U.S. Congress and policymakers.  What will it take for things to change?  How long will the U.S. society continue to tolerate the fact that just about anyone can easily have access to semi-automatic guns?  This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

0,"Muckamuck, I'm only badmouthing your excessive gov't salary because our city is not performing!  Like I've said we are broke, our streets are a mess, crime is out of control, education is hurting, higher taxes are in the works, etc. Meanwhile you get a hefty raise while others take cuts but you can keep on enjoying your amazing gov't health insurance, retirement plan and almost unlimited paid time off. I can see we pushed your buttons with our opinions.
"
0,"""""While the city, with its property tax revenue rising, has steadily increased its spending on parks operations in recent years, virtually all of the added money has gone toward increased pay and bene­fits for employees and to rising materials costs, city budget figures show. ~ The city’s parks staff has remained flat at 79 full-time-­equivalent workers in recent years, while the total labor cost of those workers has increased 21 percent — $8.2 million from $6.8 million — since 2013-14, according to the figures.""""  This pencils out to something like a 7% increase in costs per annum. In other words, unsustainable. I support parks as much as anyone, but the city needs to get a handle on costs before asking for more tax dollars.

0,"I really am not sure why teachers should have trouble knowing how to add, subtract, multiply, divide and maybe some work with fractions.  This is what students mostly learn from grades 1-6, and which they're apparently getting worse at doing.  Since these are absolutely basic tools before you can do anything else in math, that's pretty bad.  But a teacher shouldn't require special math skills to teach arithmetic at this level.  What I HAVE heard is that teachers don't understand how to teach the discovery math stuff, since it's not straightforward.  Rather than re-educating the teachers on that, I'd chuck the curriculum and focus on those basics.  Later on, algebra, trigonometry and calculus require better honed skills obviously, but this is not the issue with little kids.
"
0,"Not at all.  They rely on fossil fuels just like all the holier-than-thou eco-Nazis!  They should be admired more, of course,  because of their smaller 'carbon footprint' than the hypocrites I described above.  In fact, their frequent defecation and urination into the Willamette River  is true ecology!  I used to observe that when I lived over on Goodpasture Island Road.  They are returning to the natural order of things here in Oregon as practiced by the noble Native Americans!

0,"I considered buying TF last fall, but I worry about the overheated Canadian housing market. So I chose Chesswood (CHW) instead. CHW lends mostly to smaller businesses in th U.S. Still risky, but it has higher ratings in the G&M's Detailed Stock Reports database.  On this note, the Globe published a cautionary piece about investing in near-banks a few months ago. I also own  First National (FN), preferring the higher yields to that of Canadian banks. I recently sold TD and RY, taking profits on the latter two. The Globe could have a more complete discussion about investing in near banks vs. the traditional banks.

0,"It's a philosophical question.  Should the legislature take money out of local economies (PFD changes) and the wages of citizens (income taxes)in order to fund credits to multi-billion dollar oil companies?  Maybe I'm crazy, but to me this is a no-brainer.  I think the oil companies will survive without the credits.

Instead of being a True leader, and say something leader like: We will not tolerate the interference in any form by any other country in the democratic functions of our country. Done deal.

0,"No, per US intelligence agencies the RNC was hacked by the Russians as well.  The difference was that the Russians chose not to release anything found on the RNC site because it would hurt their horse in the race Trump.

0,"This type of article is why Donald Trump has such fervent supporters because he says uncomfortable facts once in a while. The official American unemployment rate is 4.4% but that only counts people who are looking for work. Around 17.5% of American males in prime working age are not employed. You have to go back to the Great Depression to see such numbers. This large group of unemployed people are primarily in the Rust Belt and get angry when they read articles that the American economy is doing well.  In America, there is a strong belief in the individual looking out for himself or herself which is why universal healthcare is having a hard time taking root. However once people get used to something it's hard to get rid of it. This is why Obamacare is growing in popularity.

0,"They might hold this one as the PCs tend to do quite poorly here even win they win province wide.  Only the Rosedale portion which is a small portion of the riding are the PC's strong.  The NDP is competitive but their chances are probably better in the next election as the new riding boundary lops off the Rosedale portion thus making it more NDP friendly.  Essentially the Liberals always win here, by either winning throughout in a good election or coming second in every part of the riding while the NDP usually gets clobbered in Rosedale and the PCs elsewhere while the Liberals are competitive throughout the riding.  So tough to say but if the Liberals lose this they are in big trouble.

0,"If there is such a thing as a just war, then there must be also such a thing as an unjust peace (or, at least, an unjust policy of non-military intervention).  I am a pacifist by moral conviction but not, alas, by nature: if you come at me with a knife while I have a firearm, you'll be the first in kingdom-come.  My difficulty with the very idea of just war is that its intellectual and moral integrity depends upon the (to my mind) altogether dubious premise that there is a moral imperative to kill, or to be willing to kill. And this, for me as a Christian, is where the whole complex and nuanced weave of Just War Theory unravels spectacularly.  Try as I might, I could not find anywhere in the Gospel even the vaguest ground for such an imperative. So while I shall kill if I have to, to protect my life or the lives of others, I really don't want to appeal to unconvincing Augustinian notions of  justice to assuage my conscience. """"I did what I had to do"""" would be my best defence.

For a Catholic bishop to encourage people to disrupt society is gravely irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric.  Also, the bishop claimed Trump described himself as a """"disrupter.""""   That is untrue.  I would be first to condemn any political candidate who said it was his mission to """"disrupt"""" the civil order.   But Trump has never once described himself or his campaign with the word """"disrupter.""""

"
0,"this is a very good example of the unseen/unappreciated side of taxation policy in Canada.  its not just about dollars earned.  its about managing incredible responsibility for others, with no realistic alternative by way of pension for retirement.  The liberals are looking at earning numbers in a vacuum without regard to the situation on the ground for doctors and other professionals.  The policy fails to look a fairness beyond the numbers.  we are all not similarly situated to those with public/private pensions, with contribution from the state, financed in large part by 50 percent plus taxation on individuals, who out of necessity rushed to incorporate to shoulder business expenses, and looming retirement costs, in a very low yield market.  if we don't want to encourage incorporation,  go ahead and do away with RRSP and TFSA limits, and impose a flat tax in the amount of 35 percent.  Problem solved.

0,"Jerry, these kids have seen BLM protests with riots and looters for years. They did not copy that behavior. They chose to copy the peaceful, respectful protest. They aren't committing crimes, breaking any rules or laws or causing LEO to don riot gear, tear gas, batons, shoot rubber bullets or fire departments & EMS to respond to citywide violence. They didn't do any of that. That behavior has been seen on tv since the LA riots with Rodney King to the Baltimore riots. They CHOOSE not to copy, emulate or perpetuate any of that. They chose to kneel. This is the perfect example why we must hold Pro Athletes to high standards. Good or bad, our children watch and emulate their role models.  Our Pro Athletes that commit domestic violence, rape, assaults, DUI, DWI, manslaughter, theft and murder have modeled that behavior for years. No one said anything. One NFL kneels and suddenly the entire nation is outraged but Americans won't tolerate THAT. I am proud of  ASD and West. I support freedom.

The city probably has more opportunity and more high earners than the rest of Ontario combined. It certainly has more business.   You have already been promised a bigger slice of the gas tax, and you already get subsidies for transit.  The rest of Ontario grows weary of giving you handouts.  If 905 are the beneficiaries of your expressway largesse, go talk to Mississauga’s mayor about fund transfers.  Those of us outside of the GTA who rarely or never use these roads don’t want to know.

It takes 2 to fight, and while most of us are disgusted by the white supremacist ideals and incendiary actions, the protesters that gathered to challenge the white supremacists also contributed to the violence. This country will go to the dogs if the Dems continue to be naysayers to every single issue dealing with Trump.  If the Dems are truly there to better this country, they need to put away their differences and look for common ground and attempt to establish an honest working relationship with the GOP, finding areas of agreement that they can build on.

0,"Gars - my parents are one of those """"Rural"""" people that you say are paying less for their homes.  The reality however is very different.  They live 40 min's north of Toronto and their house on a sideroad outside of their town costs about as much as one in town and has the same level of property tax.  The only municipal services they receive are snow plows, emergency services and garbage pick up.  Because they are outside of town they have their own septic and well but when the town went sewers - their property taxes paid some of the cost etc.  So it is just not the cities and towns that are subsidizing people.  There is fiber less than 1 km from their home but no one wants to run it down the sideroads because of the cost - this is despite the fact that Bell actually has needed to replace the wired copper for the last 20 years after it was cut and never properly repaired.

Trump is the ultimate Republican wallowing in government largesse while dedicated to destroying all government efforts to provide access to the basic needs for life for the individual human.  Republican philosophy demands establishment of a the old European class structure for the benefit of the few over the many.  Everything Republican is Anti-American and Anti-human.  Republican is just another name for English Tory with Monarchy and/or Dictatorship as the ideal.  The current and recent Democratic Party has joined the Republicans in philosophy and action.

0,"Lazy can be simply assuming that the medical field knows best.  It doesn't always.  Western medicine has drifted towards more and more unnatural fixes than natural ones.  Granted, not all solutions are natural.  But, nature did a pretty good job with its biologicals and their immune and repair systems.  Going away from that immediately might be where the majority of these problems originate.  Maybe one of my examples might raise an eyebrow or two.  Maybe someone might either associate with a similar problem they're having and not have once suspected such an easy fix.   So, they might give it a shot.  I've seen other countries where they don't struggle with sicknesses and reliance on meds like we do.  That's what got me questioning our approach.  It's what fixed a lot of my issues.  Most of my problems were resolved by accident simply because of dietary changes.  I'm no genius...I was just copying what I saw was successful for others, and it worked better than I'd hoped.

0,"Well stated, Kevin. Under Trump the Republican Party is no longer a party of conservatism (something it had been drifting away from at an accelerated pace even before he seized the narrative). It's become a far-right ethno-identity politics party like those found in Europe, driven by a personality cult. This is as far from true conservatism as one can get. Conservatives can debate policies because they are driven by ideas. Far-right politics is devoid of policies because it is driven by reactionary impulses and contempt for ideas. Too often under Obama the tendency has been to make things up as they went along, but at least there was regard for basic rules of civility. For the next four years we won't even have that to guide us. It's going to be rough ride. Our only hope is for Americans left right and center to place American and constitutional values above their respective party preferences. Because party and leader first will be the only ethic under Trump. That's not conservatism.

Now I admit it was a small survey, but even those who were quite doctrinal and who I thought would back the Group of 4, they didn't.  It was good to note that Pope Francis was """"their"""" pope and they didn't care to think of anyone taking potshots at him.   Several noted that in matters of faith the pope was infallible and also noted that they would have been handled by inquisitors in the past.

She commands sufficient media attention that she could have read King's statement elsewhere and had the same or nearly the same effect on Senator Sessions' confirmation to head the DOJ. Then there's the matter that King's statement was 31 years old. Who of us is the same person we were 31 years ago? As an example of our ability to change, George Wallace, in his 1963 inaugural address, declared """"segregation today . . . segregation tomorrow . . . segregation forever.""""

The liberals need to find a way to fund their out-of-control, irresponsible spending and plan to do it by raiding those of us capable of legally saving money.  The steps that incorporated businesses use to manage taxation are LAW.  Not LOOPHOLES, not SCHMEMES, or any of the rhetorical terms used by the government and sadly the media.

Yes, there are scientific uncertainties re: the details and pace of impacts -- e.g. how fast we will lose Arctic sea ice; exactly when, where, and how severe will be the next floods or droughts; how fast will sea levels rise; etc.  But there is virtually no uncertainty regarding the fact that climate change impacts will generally be catastrophic, and the only rational policy approach is to drastically reduce global carbon emissions, livestock grazing, and deforestation.

I can only conclude that they continue to see things so very differently from the rest of us.  Part of that is THEIR fault , in that they set and taught the morality most of us us as our lens for seeing all of this.  Part of it is ours, for we let it happen, by not walking out en-masse, by not demanding more, by not holding them accountable on every possible level.  It's NOT that they all need to go.  It's that few or none have had the stones to leave on their own out of shame.  Even pope Francis has backed off, so the game will continue.  I don't know what kind of man could NOT be shamed by these failures.  But so far, only words, only conditional (conditioned??) regret that does  translate to anything I can trust to represent real change.  Ultimately, the bishops are demanding that we trust them.  Right now, I still can't.

0,"As much of the debate in the Charlie Gard case this journalist is either ill informed or choosing to ignore most of the facts. The world renowned children's hospital considered giving Charlie the experimental treatment. in January on the chance it might help.. He began having seizures and it was the brain damage resulting in those seizures that caused the hospital to decide not to go ahead. Any funds the parents raised privately for transfer to the US were not available for three months after that. Many top doctors, from other hospitals and countries, consulted on this case, the parents appointed their own independent consultant, they all concurred that the treatment would not benefit the child. The parents did not give 'informed consent' to using Charlie for experimental purposes.  They insisted to the end that this was a treatment that would make Charlie a 'normal little boy' Charlie was given the best available, without concern for costs.  In the UK we do not experiment on babies.

Following introduction of the voter ID law, the elections of 2008 and 2011 had the lowest absolute voter participation (52.9% and 54.0%, respectively) of any federal elections in Canadian history since women got the vote in 1921.  By contrast, absolute turnout in 2015 was 61.0%. (Nominal turnout in 2015 was 69.1%) . Prior to the end of door-to-door household enumeration, absolute turnout was never less than 61.5% (1925), had been as high as 75% (1957), and was typically 69% - 70%. . If the law had been the same in 2008 and 2011 as it was before 1993, there would have been 2.5 - 3.5 million more votes.  The Harper majority came not from winning """"millions of votes"""", but by suppressing millions of votes. . Mathematically speaking, the electoral phenomenon that gave Harper a majority was, in fact, remarkably similar to Trump. . Note: Absolute turnout = Votes/Population eligible to vote. Nominal turnout = Votes/Population registered to vote.

This Catholic vote is sometimes nicknamed the """"Holy Grail"""" and somehow it seems to always go with the winner. In almost all of the post war elections Catholics were solidly Democratic and the issue of clerical sex abuse was not a public issue, even when it was much more serious in the 1960's and 1970's.  Catholics went Republican for Bush in the contentions election of 2000 and the """"Great Lent"""" storm hit in Boston in 2002.   This went on for several years then began to die down after about 2008 with the Democrats getting a thin margin of Catholic voters.   But Trump had the  """"Holy Grail"""" in the 2016 election earlier this month, so I suspect another storm is coming.  I think this is a way of """"payback"""" from groups in society who really are not all that concerned with pedophilia in general.  Regrettably in our time and place all has become political.

Yet the G&M, the Star, CBC and CTV pounded away day after day, month after month, pressing Harper for an inquiry. The media did no balanced coverage whatever. Every time a FN representative was interviewed for any reason, they were asked if they supported an inquiry and of course (they are not paying for it) they answered yes. There were no difficult questions about what an inquiry would accomplish and no dissenting voices within the media (except IIRC Margaret Wente ).

They're getting sick and tired of listening to talk radio and the Washington Times attack all issues liberal or anyone who disagrees with Trump day in and day out. Even local stories covered by local talk radio hosts seem to be agenda driven. Everyone in conservative media talks and writes like they are being paid by the Koch's or Heritage and rather than seeking all the facts on issues, they just parrot the right-wing talking point of the day. When Trump admitted that he fired Comey because of the """"Trump Russia thing"""", FOX news decided that the """"real"""" story was the """"hysterical"""" reactions of Democrats.  If you want FOX and right-wing talk radio to have a shred of credibility instead of the place that conservatives go when facts, truth and reality ruin the latest conservative spin then tell them to report the news--stop slanting it.  Rhyner you are hypocrisy on steroids.

Besides, getting re-certified in Canada, especially in med-sci is near impossible for multiple reasons the least of which is the closed system of the medical profession.

Once in Canada it became apparent that these tradesmen were really not qualified in their trade. The Caribbean government appeared to be part of a scam to get their citizens employed in another country in the hope that the workers would send money back to relatives in the home country.  The Caribbean is not the only area that certifies tradesmen to a much lower standard than Canada. (Again this is based on actual work place experience.)  Vetting of the qualifications of skilled people is part of the process for the Canadian government.

0,"Testosterone is associated with aggression, strength and in social terms, violence and criminality. No connection with intelligence, reason or reflection. Yet these attributes are the foundation of 'civilization'.  In evolution, it was the end of male leader dominance for mates that began the process of fully diversifying the gene pool. Testosterone is a dead end. Other factors and the spread of those factors through diverse mating practices and then pair bonding explain what is truly distinct about human development.  People always make the mistake of looking for commonalities with apes etc to explain the evolutionary trail when it is the points of distinction that should be explored.  And while we are at it, many researchers believe it was females who made the first tools and evolved the cultural practice of agriculture. The critical roots of 'civilization'.  Intelligence and creativity is not exclusive to one sex or gender. But social structures can make it seem that way.

The real problem is all those snooty liberals who keep trying to muddle everything up with facts and truth,

1,"Trump is a one term Presidency and being that said, I agree with you, HE needs to shut his trap and tweets! He is not almighty in a sense that he can do it alone. The Campaign is OVER! He needs to get his campaign promises done as that's the agenda for which I support him. He needs TheEstablishments support, he needs to SHUT his TRAP and Tweets of the Politicians failures to get it done. As it is it may be too late, his words of the blame game can't be taken back. TheEstablishments failures to Fix or even Repeal/Replace speaks for itself of themselves! Trump is too self-righteous of sorts pointing out of others failures. He has to get off his high horse defending himself and/or burning it in to those that failed.

0,"There is no way we can know if these people would still be alive today were there a concrete barrier to prevent a head-on collision.  All we can say is that they would not have died from a head-on collision.  Troopers, highway engineers, and the public have discussed this center line median at community meetings.  The solution was thought to be worse than the problem not only from a road maintenance issue; it was the likelihood of creating more accidents (other than a head-on collision) due to a barrier down the middle of a narrow two-lane highway.  (How many of us can navigate that highway without crossing the center line at least once?)  One unintended result would be southbound vehicles that would (for whatever reason) hit the median barrier and ricochet through a guardrail into Turnagain Arm, or for northbound vehicles, being redirected into the rocks/cliffs next to the shoulder.  Solving one problem (head-on collisions) could, in theory, create many more problems.

0,"There were a few core themes around Trump's campaign success:   Immigration, Trade (protectionism), and """"Making America Great"""".  To suggest that renegotiating NAFTA was just words misses the fact that the Democrats wanted to do the same.    It is low hanging fruit to at least make a show of tearing it up.  Canada has a LOT on the table with the US.    Making overtures that we are willing to sit down at the table is a good idea.     What's the alternative?   Bury your head in the sand and hope Trump doesn't notice?  Canada has a LOT to negotiate (NAFTA, Softwood, Keystone, NATO spending, border issues) and the worst thing to do is wait for Trump to appear on live television tearing up an agreement as his opening tactic.

Like it or not, vulgarities, slang, whatever you want to call it are a part of our vernacular and always have been.  In fact, many have a longer history in our languages than most  so called proper terms.  I remember when I was with the Franciscans and the old Friar who taught us pointed out that in one story St Francis told a novice who was being bothered by a vision of Christ that Francis knew was actually the devil.  Francis told the novice (according to our book) to tell the devil to open his mouth so the novice could empty his bowels in it.  The old Friar teaching us laughed and said the original Latin was much more graphic.  And this was in one of the official lives of St Francis from the Middle Ages.  The same Friar told us that an uncensored version of most medieval sermons if properly translated would be condemned by the modern church as too filthy.

This is also covered in scientific publications.  http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/07/us/clue-to-why-cystic-fibrosis-has-survived.html  So, it's important to weigh the fact that the genes that cause cystic fibrosis are there to protect the human race from being wiped out by epidemics of cholera.   If you edit the genetics, you change the protective features related to the genes as well as the bad.   Once copy of the gene = protection against cholera.   Two copies of the gene = cystic fibrosis.  It's not all upside when it comes to """"fixing genetics"""".   And yet, what you will hear from those who stand to make money is that it is all upside.  This is just one example.

Like the Kochs, Trump essentially wants to have the billionaire class exempted from any responsibility to maintain public services.  Obama inherited an economy that was on the verge of collapse, but I don't expect your memory goes back as far as eight years. Whatever your personal situation has been, the country recovered without undergoing a depression and perhaps helping to precipitate a worldwide crash.

All the while consumers continue to buy oil shipped in from places that do not have Canada's enviro, moral and ethical standards. The height of hypocrisy and cognitive dissonace IMHO... Why is WesternCanadian energy being singled out for treatment that is not given to other sources. Why are the masses not fighting against Venezuelan oil being shipped into St John or Montreal? Why?

0,"So this is the standard stereotype of conservatives in Canada? Most amusing. You seem to have inferred rather too much from my post.  The dominant characteristics of left-liberal thought are all here: the assumption that anyone from the right cannot spell, cannot think, plays hockey, drinks Molson, and is generally completely barbaric when compared to the denizens of Toronto.  This is why the Brexiteers in the UK and Trump won - because ordinary people have had quite enough of sneering left-wing progressives. And, this is not just the stupid hicks, the poor, the old white men who are just not forward thinking enough to cope in a globalist economy.

0,"I am the former Administration Director of the California Division of Workers' Compensation and therefore vitally interested in the delivery of services and benefits to work associated injured workers. The usual problem exists for injured workers to be treated by their own physician and that is a declaration to their employer that they wish to be treated by their personal physician for any work associated  injury.  In California that declaration must be made prior to any injury.  A solution could be integrated into a pre employment interview and post employment disclosure of employment benefits provided by the employer.  A simple Labor Dept, or in California the Department of Industrial Relations reg could mandate that as simple disclosure be integrated into the interview. . A simple yes or no could be sufficient without more forms. Ralph Roy Ramirez Former Administrative Director California Division of Workers' Compensation Yucaipa and Alhambra, California

0,"How do people form political opinions?    Their main source of information isn't their parents, or schools, or the church.  It's the media.  The media is the most powerful molder of public opinion.   One could say that the media has more influence on our thinking and our decisions than anything else in our culture.  And yet, there's a strong sentiment that it's unfair to criticize the media.  From where did this sentiment arise?   The media, that's where.  The media see themselves as a noble priesthood with a duty to mold public opinion.  But they are just people trying to make money, and all of them are biased.  Moreover, there exists a strong impulse of confirmation bias in the media culture to band together, make the same arguments, and hold the same opinions.  Bear this in mind the next time a news outlet says it is being """"attacked"""" because the person whom they were trying to ruin called their slanted verbiage dishonest.

For all concerned, the challenges and complexities of the transformation of both the larger society and new Canadians can cause setbacks but in the large majority of cases these are outbalanced by many benefits over time.

1,"Actually, I don't think Friedman is overly dramatic. AKBen, did you read or listen to Trump's claims and promises? Did you see how often he simply made up facts and figures? There has never been a person less qualified to be president. Do those who voted for him believe in truth, facts or reality? No such thing as human-generated planet warming? Mexico will pay for the wall? We can nuke Iran and it doesn't matter if other countries get nukes?  AKBen, if facts and logic and truth aren't what drive our discussions (and Hillary was consistently rated as highly factual, and truthful in regards to her plans and realities) what is left but uneducated bluster, glitz, parlor tricks...bull***t!  And a majority of less educated, white, reckless Americans fell for it.  Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Monroe, Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelts..these men valued education and truth above all. Now Entertainment Trumps Truth. Hang on...this is going to be some show! Thanks for voting us into hell.

Predictably, the country fell into lawless chaos, and is now a conduit for people fleeing Libya and the neighbouring region. Now EU leaders are belatedly embracing a plan to stem the flow of migrants.  I see such migration as a very just consequence of violating another nation's sovereignty. If you don't want to be overwhelmed by refugees, then don't create them in the first place.

0,"This review of  """"How Emotions Are """"made"""" misses the point.  The reviewer criticizes Barrett for constructing a theoretical straw man - localized areas of the brain generating emotion - and then destroying it. This so called """"straw man"""" encompasses most of the previous research on emotion. The reviewer criticizes Barrett's theory for making  emotion part of cognition. It's all connected. Each individual has one consciousness, so what's the criticism. The reviewer doesn't understand the """"budgeting"""" argument. Our brain has a size limited by the size of the birth canal; our cognitive apparatus evolved from primates and early stage of humans competing for food and avoiding danger. Efficiency in the brain and cognitive connections (budgeting) made survival more probable.

Cook Inlet has virtually no production taxes- so there is a negative NPV for Alaska to dole out corporate welfare for development there.

In particular how many elderly americans pay for care homes because of it. How many crtitically ill people-- including children will die without the expensive care their families can only afford under Medicaid. Why do that? It is not saving money and cutting the Federal Deficit because of the tax cuts for top bracket tax payers (middle class is not included) will take almost all of the money """"saved"""" by cutting Medicaid. Of the $1.18 Trillion, only $321 Billion will be left after the tax cuts. Do they really think that this will take care of more people than Obamacare and Medicaid? Or cut premiums when the CBO says premiums will increase by 20-50% for many americans. Why do this? Do they plan another Obamacare-like program later?

0,"I think you are grossly mischaracterizing Obamacare mandates. It required insurance to cover certain things, but which ones in particular would you consider wasteful or unnecessary? Routine care reduces long term costs, because conditions are acknowledged and managed early. It isn't like the ACA mandated free face lifts or LASIK for all. But getting people to the doctor regularly, not having an enormous cost barrier for checkups or to ask questions, all of those things are important components of quality medical care.  Covering cars is infinitely more simple than covering human health, and I don't think that drawing comparisons gets us very far. We do have minimum requirements though for what type of auto insurance you must carry if you want to drive a car, and I don't think having similar requirements for something infinitely more important and complex is unreasonable.

I guess it depends on the perspective of the person thinking about it. My thinking about Cheney is driven by the fact that he was truly consequential -- that his thinking, his worldview, was what President Bush acted on, to his own detriment and ours. Of course, history continues to unfold, and I don't exclude the possibility that our present VP, an apologist for and enabler of (and would-be successor to) the most corrupt, incompetent and unstable president is history, will turn out to be worse than Cheney was.

When there is more evidence stacked up by witnesses, in this case other employees who have been victims of Ms. Hobbs unethical behavior, should they be called on to speak in court, the case has will not only fall flat, but Ms. Hobbs will, as she aready is, open herself up to her own reputation being questioned.  I am wondering who asked the Weekly to publish this article.  I am assuming since the company she is suing is choosing to remain silent, until the court proceedings - that it was Ms. Hobbs.  So she in fact is the one slandering others.  And all this prior to a judge examining the evidence and testimony of witnesses.  This creates another twist to this article that """"smells"""" of some ill motive lurking in the shadows.  Sexual Harrassment is obviously wrong, but this story again """"smells"""" like something foul.

0,"I LOVE what Trump is doing.  His comments are politically incorrect with the effect that he is separating the pretend-men and women from the real men and women.  These athletes are sniveling cupcakes....all of them.  They have no integrity or character.  I thank God that we have a President who is calling out these PC weaklings and exposing them for the airhead phonies  that they are.  He is a lot tougher and smarter that they are.  They aren't close to being in his league. Mr. President, keep doing what you are doing.  Keep smoking out the Snivelers. We love it. By the way, these athletes, most of whom would be tied to a real job if it weren't for the fans, apparently don't see the handwriting on the wall.  Check out the attendance at the Rams-49ers game this past week.  Up to now, the Owners haven't shown courage and good sense to treat their players as employees and forbid personal opinions to be spoken in the workplace.  Cashflow deficits will change that fast!

0,"Okay, Richard, so I think maybe you're being consistent now.  I believe, however, if a woman was knocked down and unconscious -- or maybe let's say she just fainted -- and there was no witness including herself to a  robbery, yet someone was found a block away with her purse soon thereafter, the circumstantial evidence may well be enough to convict for robbery.   Even if she's asked whether she might have agreed to give her purse away and says I don't remember.  The law doesn't require proof beyond any doubt.  It's a question of whether a doubt is reasonable given all the circumstances.  Blatchford has some comments on this in the NP, her point being that the Halifax court can't simply ignore all of the circumstantial evidence and just rely on the lack of memory to acquit.  Not that anybody knows whether that's an accurate assessment without having heard the evidence, but it is implied in the judge's verbal reasons, which are what is causing all the outrage.

0,"Good point made in letter re Broadbent, Trump and PR. Many Republicans voted for Trump despite all his serious failings, because the put party first.  PR encourages people to vote by party not by person. In MMP, this is clear as one vote is strictly by party and this vote overrides the local vote as the number of seats in Parliament are determined by the party vote not by the local vote. In STV this is indirect, but with ridings 3 to 5 times larger with 3 to 5 times as many candidates, it is impossible to get to know all the candidates, the ballot has so many names on it, that people end up voting by party by default.  That is how to end up with a Trump - the person matters less than the party.  No, PR is not in the best interests of Canadians.

I.e., for every 100 votes suppressed, the Dems lost 75 - 80, while the GOP lost only 20 - 25.  How big is this? Consider the effect of voter ID laws.  In B.C. in 2013, fully 22% - 23% fewer total votes were cast than would have been cast without voter ID.  In Canada federally, in 2008, 25% fewer; in 2011, 22.7% fewer.  Without vote ID, In 2015, the NDP would have (just) outpolled the Conservatives at 33% each; instead of 36% to 30% - i.e., a 6% swing due to vote suppression. . In the UK election of 2015, famously, the polls had Labour/Tories in a dead heat; result was a 6% win for the Tories. Why?  UK voter registration law effectively disenfranchised more than 1/3 of voters under age 35.  The same effect was responsible for the Brexit result.  But in 2017, the prior registration had been more recent, so Labout did better. . In FPTP, a 6% swing is enormous - usually determinative.

More important is to understand the Vision Zero concept -  it's not just a pretty slogan,  support better road design, and most importantly, consider ways and means to improve better driving habits. Accepting slower driving speeds without complaint (because lower accident rates are a proven reality), making driving school a requirement for new drivers might be a start.  Study and learn from the Scandinavian and Dutch example. Each and every year, the Edmonton Road Safety department provides and analyses online detailed road accidents statistics; they make compelling reading and are translated into action by the city.

0,"Fire science is real. And a long run of unusually hot dry days exacerbates favorable forest fire conditions.  Increases in hot, low humidity days affects forest fuels and tree crowns as much or more than wildfire directly. Before prescribed burning in Eastern Oregon, pine needles on the ground are often bent to see if they can touch their ends without breaking. They broke earlier than normal this year due to the unusually hot and dry early summer days. These and other little indicators give on the-ground-foresters and fire managers a handle on how dry the fine fuels are in the forest and how easily they will ignite.  For example, the alleged fireworks that were tossed into a canyon by kids and credited with starting the Columbia Gorge fire might not have ignited a larger blaze had the fine fuels not been so dried-up, the day been cooler, and the forest floor moister.

We could fund a lot more of the programs that are losing money today if we started taxing churches how they SHOULD be taxed! Like everyone else!  Just because a church preaches what you think it should preach does not mean it should hold tax exemption status.

I do agree with what you imply - that when management does a good job, people aren't as interested in having a union.  It shouldn't have to be there, but it turns out, it has to be there. As said above, that all certificated employees are represented by AEA is part of a mutually agreed on contract.  Either side could make it an issue to change in bargaining.  Neither side has brought it up. There are advantages and disadvantages for both sides, as there often are.

The problem with your position is that Trump HAS clearly supported, enabled and embraced White Supremacist racism.  He can't even bring himself to do a simple thing like denounce David Duke.  He called people marching WITH the KKK, Neo Nazis, and anti-semites (generally, White Supremacists) good people (by reference to them as some sort of virtuous subset).

It's difficult to regard Jefferson as man with great character even though his writings show he had a great mind. He ignored his own words and the words of his fellow revolutionary John Adams, who said The Revolution would never be complete until the slaves were free. A spendthrift and always deeply in debt, he never freed his plantation's slaves. Jefferson hoped and expected that Virginians of Meriwether Lewis’ and William Clark’s generation would abolish slavery.  Washington was the leading founder of the Union. General Lee was a leading destroyer of the Union. Of the nine presidents who had slaves, only Washington freed his. Lee was forced to free the slaves of his wife's father's plantation inherited in 1857, after the Confederates lost The War of the Rebellion.

Do you think that maybe meeting with the Democrats and exchanging ideas and possible solutions may be the answer, rather then complaining about the Affordable Care Act? Have you ever discussed how the Affordable Care Act actually helped Alaskans?  Lisa, put your Country and State first, rather then your party.  Let's find solutions to this problem, rather then standing there wringing your hands blaming the Democrats.  After all, the Affordable Care Act was a republican alternative to the Clinton's plan back in the 1990s. The right wing think tank, Heritage Foundation, proposed the Afforable Care Act to counter Clinton's ideas for affordable heath care for all Americans.

0,"While this is both very noble and macroeconomically desirable, there are consequences which need to be foreseen and countered, otherwise there will be a nasty right wing populist backlash. Specifically, housing and education come under pressure. A good example is New Zealand, where immigration in recent years has been twice Canada's rate (1.5% as opposed to 0.7% of population annually). There, housing is even harder to acquire than in Canada, with a similar price bubble and confusion regarding foreign capital. The new left-green-nationalist coalition government has vowed to reduce immigration and to stop foreign purchases of existing housing. For Canada, clearly much more must be done to stabilise the housing market for the long term, without making it harder for people to buy their first property.  The distortions of low interest rates and neoliberal policies need to be corrected if newcomers are to be successfully integrated.

0,"BC Thoughts,  Based on your comment, it's not often that you and I agree so we should savor the moment.  That said, there are variations of PR that partially avoid the problem you describe.  However, these kludges wouldn't overcome that problem to the satisfaction of many.  Further, all PR systems transfer much of the candidate selection process from constituency organizations to the headquarters of each Party and make MLAs representatives of much larger districts rather than smaller constituencies.  The single transferable vote system retains the current constituency and candidate selection advantages but ensures that MLAs are the first or second choice of 50% of voters.  The French 2 round voting system (my personal favourite) is better on these scores but entails more expense and voters' time.  Neither of these, however, would address Dr. Weaver's concerns to his satisfaction.  The single transferable vote system would probably be the default choice of most people replacing FPTP.

Let's just take one little reported fact, seemingly small but crucial to Nigel's """"expose"""" -- Nigel says, """"He has consistently failed to make child support payments and was arrested in 2013 because he was $9,000 in arrears.""""   Actually, Fred was never arrested.  The judge threw out the warrant, realizing that Fred had paid his daughter more than $100,000 for her college education, a new computer and other support.  This was a case of a gold-digging ex-wife making claims that were not true.

China unbeknownst to the general public and our MSM, China has always done their diplomatic work behind the scenes on behalf of the US regarding forces hostile to the US. That Iranian nuclear deal? China was instrumental seeing it get started and done. Those Taliban pulling back to allow the Americans to draw down their troops? China negotiated on behalf of the US after the US asked China discreetly.  There are so many enemies of the US that the Chinese have largely stood on the sidelines and in some cases assisted the US in holding them back. The Chinese can armed Cuba and Venezuela to the teeth and put nukes there.  China can start supporting separatist forces in the US like Russia have started to do. Hawaii's separatists will find a helpful agent if the Chinese support an insurgency there.  China has very significant resources to support enemies hostile to the US compared to any other nation state or rogue group.

That is quite different than believing that there is a hunk of 'flesh'  – heart muscle or any other body part –that just looks like bread; or 'blood' apart from a body, that happens to taste like wine.  St. Thomas does NOT say 'bread and wine cease to exist'. He says their 'acccidentia' continue. That's not the same as our English 'accident'. Everything we call 'real' is the same: taste, look, feel, chemical makeup.  We easily mis-represent actual Church teaching.

It makes no sense.   And therein lies the flaw in the above argument.   The PF was not created to be be able to fund individual dividends for people who simply lived here a year.   It was a neat idea when we had more revenue than we needed to fund operations and sensible capital improvements.    The Fund's purpose was to benefit all Alaskans including future generations.    An investment model that generates revenue to fund state services benefits all Alaskans present and future by reducing the income and sales tax burdens on ALL Alaskans, present and future.    It's time to face reality: with the reduction of production levels and oil prices, there isn't enough revenue to give away.    Unfortunately It's time for the PF earnings to be utilized in the manner for which they were intended.

This kind of shortsighted, hypocritical cowardice is exactly the kind of behaviour that causes the public to dislike and distrust politicians.

I am not against celibacy. I am against the denial that it has its limits in asserting expertise, wisdom, conditions, empathy, learned knowledge, and visceral understanding.  If the Church can tell transgendered people, it's wrong to claim that sexually you're someone you are not, then it must be wrong to assert definitive knowledge of love, marriage, sex, and family when you don't have it. It literally is denying who you are. And are not.

Each one doubting how far the other will or is able to go to establish it.  In that situation, either one finally decides that the other will, in fact, use destructive measures to do so and back off, or will come to believe that he can defeat the other to do so, even at some cost to himself.  It does not require much imagination to see what such a situation might lead to.  In such situations, one would need to establish very early, through unambiguous signals that one means what one says.  I don't think that the current US-China controversy has done that, ie. the signals going back and forth, at least by Trump, don't seem to meet the test.  Many still believe Trump is full of bluster.

Further, many might opt out of such benefits programs in the future, thus transferring many of these costs, particularly for drug benefits, to already stretched provincial health budgets. The Ontario government is reportedly looking at revamping its drug program for seniors by 2019 (even though Wynne's crew will likely be turfed by then) in a move to transfer more of these costs onto middle-class pensioners.

0,"The reason that they can be returned is that legally at a Port of Entry the person is not IN Canada but once a person is admitted or physically crosses the border even illegally they can then only be returned to the country of citizenship or legal residence unless another country is willing to accept them.  This is also the case with other countries for persons arriving at international airports or on vessels from countries other than the USA unless they claim Convention refugee status.  The transportation companies are required to carry them back at their expense if served a notice.  These procedures are set out in the IRPA and regulations.  The Canadian government exploits the same POE """"IN Canada"""" loophole under the Safe Third Country designation of the US so any Convention refugee claimant coming from the US can be referred back.

Uranium One’s U.S. mines produced about 11 percent of the country’s total uranium production in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.

You of all people should know the logical difficulty of asserting the non-existence of God (this observation does not constitute proof of His existence). On the evidence before us, belief in a Creator is as reasonable or more reasonable than the alternative. As to the existence of evil being glibly ascribed to """"the devil"""", it would be more accurate to say that it flows from the free will with which we were created (suffering as a consequence of """"natural"""" disasters is a more subtle debate). Although evil is, well, evil, the gift of choice and free will is incomparable. God chose not to spare us from suffering, but He was willing to share in that suffering.

0,"Perhaps 3 times, related corporations filed for reorganization.  I am not aware of any liquidations (Chap 7), or personal bankruptcies.  Commerce is a 3-spoked wheel.  One spoke is TAXABLE BUSINESS; another NONTAXABLE BUSINESS (charitable organizations); and another BANKRUPTCY.  All 3 comprise the Capital Market, each with its unique commercial dynamic.  Compare the separate powers of the Executive, Congress, and Judiciary wherein a power lawyer is master of all. Similarly, the best businessman will master all the spokes of commerce, which is rare.  While mere pedestrians deride the commerce of bankruptcy as hell, ironically, they would easily sink to hell in taxable commerce via incompetence in basic accounting and finance, and too, be even more lost in the maze of IRC sections 501 and 401, and ERISA 1974, as amended (the nonProfit venue).

0,"Posters are right to question corporate Canada's motives when it comes to importing workers. Is it a case that the skills are not here or that companies are looking to cut costs.  The public outcry that followed revelations of abuse of the temporary foreign worker program prompted the Harper government to restrict access. Those restrictions have since been lifted and arguably it is now far too easy to import temporary and permanent workers.  There is a place for foreign workers but companies should be forced to prove the needed skills are not there. They should also be forced to pay the going wage as well as a foreign worker premium (e.g. within the employment insurance structure) to be used to offset training costs in Canada.  Most occupations and segment of society in this country are organized in some fashion. Even seniors have their own association. It's time perhaps the unemployed had their own organization - a group that could push politicians to act in their interests.

In our system of government, i believe, that we, as a people, in the next four years, can live and learn our way through it, and in the end, be better for the experience.

1,"The level of sanctimony bothers me too, not to mention the outright hypocrisy.  There is unanimous condemnation of the polygamy in Bountiful, BC.  Women, it seems, must be rescued from their self-serving male religious leaders who promote polygamy.  A woman is considered incapable of applying informed and independent consent to enter into a polygamous marriage.  (Child marriage is another issue entirely, as it is child abuse; I speak only of polygamous marriages among adults).  And yet it is considered racist to assume the same for a Muslim woman.  Her decision (if it is indeed her decision) to subject herself to the self-serving rules of their male leaders is considered an absolute and untouchable right.  Why the double-standard?    How is it that Mormon women are considered """"brainwashed"""" and in need of protection while Muslim women do not?  The state can't interfere with Muslim practices but can and should with Mormon practices.  Talk about sucking and blowing at the same time.

I can see the argument about this being overzealousness. But I can also see the argument that it is a violation.

Therefore, the question confronting the House of Representatives is whether the President has committed a """"high Crime or Misdemeanor.""""

But the figures for men are not ZERO, right?  Front line triage's decision on whether to bring in supplementary medical care should be predicated on the presence or absence of injuries, ie. the actual salient concern, not the person's sex.

Somehow you are a follower of Jesus and wish to judge others (homosexuals) while having a plank in your own eye.  Again I don't think so.   Somehow you are a follower of Jesus and detest immigrants.  Once again, I don't think so.  Only the right wing can take Jesus' very simple teachings and distort them completely the other way.

0,"That raises the question of whether or not Kim is rational or irrational;  indeed, whether or not the Allies are rational or irrational?  """"Kim knows that he would lose a war."""" is the received wisdom of most in the West.  But is that the case?  If Kim believes his NK doctrine, then:  1) He is a living, infallible, invincible deity;  such gods cannot be defeated.  2) The Kim Dynasty must inevitably re-unite Korea under their rule.  3) NK has prepared for a nuclear war since 1953; key elements would survive a nuclear exchange with the US.  4) By contrast, the US has no effective defense against NK H-bombs, EMP attacks, and biological weapons.  5) NK has overwhelming internal political support for war;  the US has none. 1/2 hate Trump.  6) NK should punish the US for the ruthless war waged against Korean civilians c 1950-53.  7) By destroying the US, NK can also get revenge against Japan which destroyed Korea c 1910-45.

My biggest problem? The quick reference in this article to the other side of the story is just not good enough, so is the reaction from Spur. That is to say the black woman is “lily white” in her reaction. Sorry after watching that video i think not. So Spur, own up to the whole story and stop discriminating against one side only, whether it is current populist politics or not to slag off one side of the population. I also did not see one owner saying he would like to see both sides of the story through interviewing both parties. There are clear biased opinions here and because of that the chain is hurting. Quality of journalism seriously biased and getting another thumbs down from me. Rebecca should go get another forum to publish here libtard drivel please.

0,"Norsat specializes in satellite communications in the security and defence sectors, which ought to raise concerns about strategic sensitivities. Wonder 'who' is behind the offer of Privet Fund Management of Atlanta. There is little doubt that Hytera has the complete backing of the Chinese Central Authority.  A U.S. government official would not comment on the sale of Norsat to Hytera, but it must have concerned the U.S. Administration since Norsat's clients include NATO, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. Department of Defence. Interesting situation. I can't imagine China allowing the sale of such a firm to the highest bidder without any review -- it just wouldn't happen. Maybe Canada could learn a lesson about strategic priorities and how to place national interests first as is done in China -- China operates in its own interests for the long term.  By comparison, the Liberal government is just occupying space in Ottawa while national interests continue to evaporate.

0,"I disagree; the kids graduating today have access to and knowledge of a great deal more now than back in yesteryear.  From where I graduated kids either went straight to work, joined the military or went to college.  Only 10 to 15% of us went to college.  It was a lot less expensive in the 1980s per credit than it is today.  The opportunities and prospects today are much broader now than yesteryear.  If someone needs or wants new training, degree or advanced degree it is much more available now than before.  That is a good thing.  What I do see now more than before are parents who are NOT working with teachers as a team.  Instead, if Johnny didn't get what the parents FEEL Johnny deserves, there is pressure on the teacher, pressure on the school...pressure everywhere except upon Johnny.  That is not the teacher's responsibility - that is the parents' responsibility.  Healthcare and infrastructure in Alaska costs a lot.  That is not the teacher's fault.

The railroads will have to cut other expenditures to pay for it. We spent $9 billion last year on maintenance and expansion, and we’ll spend $9 billion this year, except $700 million of that will be on the first steps of PTC implementation. What will fall out of the budget? What will fall out when the PTC spend is $1.2 billion a year in 2011? Expansion? Certainly! But what about tie replacement and other things that make the railroad safer? It’s not a threat, it’s just the way it is. Something has to give.

0,"One virtually never sees a new entrant to an established industry.  Generally, it is the opposite, as the industry matures, it is dominated by fewer and fewer companies.  There are efficiencies of size that dominate.  New entrants face enormous barriers to entry, i.e. amount of money needed to set up an infrastructure necessary to compete with established giants.  In ordinary capitalism, i.e. without government intervention, investors will not try to break into an established industry (unless a new invention could revolutionize it).  Thus competition to GM and Chrysler will not come to be.  If they had been allowed to go bankrupt, investors would have bought up the assets and introduced new management and organization.  Production would continue giving suppliers a level of continuity, but freed from unsustainable constraints and with a world strategy, ultimate sales could have exceeded US oriented prior sales.  In the end, the US might have been better off.

How many carbon-fiber 2x4's could they have made for that and just bolt-casted them to concrete piers for people to sit on instead? I'll bet the geniuses in charge of this boondoggle could produce a 2x4 for less than $100 -- a comparative bargain to $100 pickleball paddles, but few will end up in homeowners decks at that price. Those in charge of city parks need to have one of those high-tech 2x4's laid up'side their heads. If they needed $20k to maintain their existing benches what is going to happen to them now? Will they rot? At least wooden benches can be burned to keep homeless people warm. Do that with carbon-fiber and you'll get fined for hazardous waste disposal without a permit.

I am also not saying that we should only look at black on black violence, but black on black violence is drastically out of proportion to other ethnicities in small to mega urban areas.  And to use a military term that should be our main effort at decreasing to a societal acceptable level.  If we don't believe genetics is the cause then it has to be nurture/societal, there is no way around that.  So we are back to what is causing it and how do we decrease it.  Another question to ask is when (or is it a myth?) did black on black violence become so out of proportion to other ethnicity violence and why?

0,"Why is it acceptable for Muslim Imams to preach hatred against other religions?
"
0,"I understand the confusion.  While Muslim is a term used to describe those who subscribe to a religious set of beliefs, Islam is an ideology that's stepping into taking the place of governing law with legal courts.  What we must do as a society is recognize to what we are responding and why.  As late at 2008 the House of Lords declared Shariah incompatible with human rights for a reason.  Their history is not one of peace. It is one of pure blood spilling by killing more than 270 Million - yes I said 270 million - people for not being Muslim. For - not - being - muslim.  The Christian crusades.... 1 - 3 million.  https://youtu.be/t_Qpy0mXg8Y  Today, Islam is being used as a tool to brutally knock out nationalism throughout the EU - We have lost Paris, much of France, Sweden now the rape capital, England has 155 Shariah courts, Italy is on the verge of a civil war, and Germany...  Greek Isles are no more.  No go zones in the US...  The NWO movement - Where's your outrage?

0,"Another take.  All of what Margaret said is true.  What we always overlook in marvelling at the lack of backbone in university administrations is that, even in Canada, the student is now the buyer.  Tuitions have gone sky high driven by free money (low low interest rates) and easy availability.  So, rubbing the little snowflakes the wrong way jeopardizes new enrollments and may promote some transfers to other schools.  How the snowflakes got to be that way was addressed in the article.  In rare cases, this behaviour can backfire on the administration.  Univ. of Missouri (Miz)  had a big demonstration of the entitled charmers and one of the feminist professors started demanding some """"muscle"""" to oust some reporters they didn't like..

High wages, low unemployment, free education, low crime, free health care, a trade surplus, a budget surplus and some of the toughest environmental laws on the planet! Protecting the environment does not hinder German prosperity, why would Trump believe it is hindering ours? Why not mandate that every import into our country meet the same environmental standards during manufacturing as California? This would bring jobs home and help save the planet.

Like several others, I parked and jumped out of my car to see if I could help.  The police were there within two minutes.  The fire trucks and ambulances were also there in minutes.  Every one was kind, calm, and helpful.  CPR was performed even as one person was lifted into the ambulance.  Jaws of life was used to free one person from a car.  Everything was done to attend the victims. I was also impressed with how many citizens ran to help, and then stayed with the teenaged girls and their mom until professionals took over.  A man named John stabilized the mom's neck and the words he spoke were comforting and appropriate. Amazing, kudos!

0,"A Safe Zone is typically a designation to protect the homeless from unnecessary ticketing and fines for simply giving in to the bodily function of needing to sleep. So I would say it fits your first scenario, """"keeping the homeless safe from the non-homeless."""" Otherwise what happens is a person falls asleep someplace, the police show up and ticket/fine them money for simply complying with human body requirements. They do not have money so the unpaid misdemeanor ticket in Hawaii turns into a criminal warrant. So then their only crime was sleeping but can prevent them from getting jobs and many other things. Safe Zones also helps prevent the clogging of our courts systems with warrants and time spent on really trivial matters such as sleeping.

But the ADS-B data should show their altitude and track, and we'll know if they filed IFR or not. If they were on an IFR plan, they were way off in altitude, which usually requires at least a 2000' clearance from the highest terrain in the vicinity. If they had an emergency at altitude, they should have had time to at least issue a mayday. But from the photo and reports from the site, it looks as though they flew straight into the mountain at cruise speed.

0,"Just a few thoughts... The parish I grew up in built a new Church in the Early 80s that represents the modern church architecture being defended here, and the current church I go to was built in this style (and remains in this style despite having some wonderful priests).  At the very least, moving the tabernacle from behind the alter is a source of great confusion.  Ultimately people tend to genuflect towards the front of the Church, and when the tabernacle is moved to one side, it means we are genuflecting to the alter, not Christ.  In addition, the more extreme versions of Church in round are not very functional for facilitating communion.  The very long pews that wrap around make it difficult to easily get to an aisle to move forward to communion.  As something that seems trivial, but perhaps not, the short central aisle (assuming there is one at all),  I suspect has convinced more than one couple on the fence about getting married in the Church to go somewhere else.

0,"Actually, the concourses being away from the terminal is the only way DEN can handle as much traffic as it does as efficiently as it does. The extra space between everything means planes wait less when taxiing, and I can live with spending an extra three minutes doing train things versus sitting on the plane waiting to taxi.  As for parking close in to the terminal, last I checked there was a reasonable amount if you're okay with paying garage rates. But that's been awhile; I've been dropped off or taken the train to the airport for the past few years.  As for concessions in the terminal, moving them post-security, while cleaning up security, means I'm way more comfortable hanging around the terminal rather than working to get on the right side of the checkpoint as quickly as possible. That means more $$$ for concessionaires, and some of that goes back to the airport. Works for me.

One wonders whether it's called the Paris Accord, not a treaty, just to bypass America's Constitutional requirement for a treaty to be ratified.  The trick is this:  Under Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties (Vienna, 23 May 1969), America's Constitution does not matter, once our country's representative signs --or in some way agrees-- to an international agreement, the United States must consider itself bound by that agreement. If our representative signs something which is not a treaty or agrees to it through diplomatic channels, that's the equivalent of a signed treaty. Senate ratification is not needed or required.

0,"I cannot understand the resentment of the private sector towards the public sector. People make choices and should take responsibility for them. If you chose to work in the private sector and your company screwed you on pensions from defined benefit to defined contributions be angry with the company. If your company made your job less secure with contracts and more part time people or automation or outsourcing to china or Mexico be angry with the company. For many years private companies made more money than public sector ones as did their employees. Where were the complaints then? The public service employee had nominal job security and a pension. Since 2008 much of that has changed. Why is it suddenly a race to the bottom? I respect our public service people and believe they do a good job. We all benefit. Jealousy, envy and government bashing  is not a good reason for public policy. Certainly some areas need trimming (Police officers in TO get paid way too much), but not all.

The issue here is that these discernments have been sub rosa, occurring in the privileged sanctuary of a penitent confessor relationship. Francis dare to make reference to this possibility in a footnote. To the legalists he has broken the rules and must pay by renouncing what he actually said. Tis the pity.

0,"3% sounds small.  That represented in dollars doesn't.  Not going to blame any one party since they both play the game to buy votes while passing budgets and programs that aren't balanced.  That's a huge failure of government.  Heard a cool story awhile back.  When Johnson was going to start his social programs, he had a meeting with Ed Kennedy.  They were talking about how to present this to the public and get it sold.  Kennedy told him never to talk about projected costs over future years, because the public would see that the programs were a drain and they'd never fund it.  So, they limited the talk to the first couple years where the problems didn't show.  Welcome to the world of government.

1,"Competition is fine.  But this isn't selling TVs or cell phones.  This is a party nomination where only one person advances to the real competition (the general election).  This is more like picking your starting QB BEFORE the real competition starts.  Last year's 5-way race (damn judges petition rulings) was a perfect example.  The highly diluted field allowed someone without broad appeal (Glenn) to take the nomination with just 37% of the vote.  The result in November was predictable.  They really need to switch to instant runoff voting where there's more than 2 candidates in the race.  Until they have that, then the party needs to practice the age-old method of weeding down the field internally before the primary.  That had already happened last year until a damn judge decided to ignore the ballot petition rules.

The Egyptian Army was mainly untrained conscripts and Israel eventually defeated them. Jordan overran the West Bank and Old Jerusalem. 1967: Threatened with destruction, Israel struck first. Israel left five fighter planes in Israel, and used the rest of their air force to wipe out the air forces of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. With total air superiority, Israel overran the other forces.

0,"We need to simplify the tax system. We also need to stop rewarding capital over labour and thereby trying to game the economy in favour of one group over the other. There is zero evidence that leveling capital gains tax with income tax would have any impact on investment. I would make a few changes though. (i) Options should only be taxable when exercised and a capital gain incurred, not when issued. (ii) Anyone should be allowed to invest in early-stage high risk investments, the whole idea of 'eligible investor' should go away. (iii) ABIL should be for 100% of the loss (Allowable Business Investment Loss). (iv) Loss pass throughs should be for all types of investment or none, not for targeted industries. Preferably none. Having a lower rate for capital gains is a way to game the economy in favour of one group over another. Having pass throughs for one industry and not another games the economy. Privileging one group of investors over another is discriminatory.

There is a huge wage gap in this country and it's getting worse.

One thing Chad should have mentioned is that a Senate seat can be filled by appointment, but the Constitution requires that a House vacancy can be filled only by an election.  When Mark Takai returned home and announced he would not seek re-election, that's when it would have been logical for him to resign to open the way for a special election.  I believe he never cast any vote or attended House meetings after then, so the seat was vacant in fact if not officially.  Why did he not resign?  Probably because Dem party bosses told Takai not to, for fear a Republican might be elected when Dems split their vote (as happened when Djou won because Case and Hanabusa split the Dems vote).  Dem bosses decided an empty seat with no voice for the people was preferable to letting the people elect a Republican.  Thus citizens in CD1 have had no rep for most of this year.

Was he interviewed prior to his admission to PNAC by the diocese or by PNAC and if so, did his past simply not come up or if so, did it not raise any red flags?

So much so  that attempts have been made to change the way it happens to make it more accessible to political influence- thanks heavens that has failed to this point  Candidates are rigorously vetted by the Alaska Judicial Council  http://justice.uaa.alaska.edu/forum/21/3fall2004/a_akjudicial.html  which operates well outside the usual political influence routine.

0,"If health insurers were all making so much money, they would not be dropping out of the market, leaving many areas with only one or no providers. Removing their modest (in percentage terms compared to other industries) profits altogether by going to single payer will not make up for the large premium increases we have been seeing, but will only guaranty rationing with medical decisions made by someone other than you and your doctor. This is happening in every country which has tried it so far. Complying with 20,000 pages of Obamacare regulation is a large part of the cost increases, along with covering everyone with serious conditions who could not get coverage before. Strong-arming Pharma and providers to take less only reduces innovation and quality (see Medicaid where doctors refuse to take on those patients at severely reduced rates, thus rationing their care, with outcomes no better than those without insurance, but at nearing $1 Trillion/yr. taxpayer cost).

Canada already has a shortage of simple technology, like CT Scans and MRIs which delay diagnoses and treatment and prolong suffering.  In England people buy private health insurance, on top of their NHS tax which can cost up to $38,800 a year per person and will inccreasse by $500 this year.  They do so, to get prompt care and private rooms.  NHS Hospitals feature 8-bed wards with curtains separating patients.  Most NHS facilities would fail the Joint Commission accreditation required in America.  Germany requires its citizens to buy private health insruance, sort of like the AHA.  Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands have neighborhood systems that collect taxes and provide services, not a central single payer.  I am not a Republican and do not support their plan.

Right up to parliament and the president being subject to the rule of law.  The same goes for teachers. If teachers do not obey the rules, laws and regulations that their superiors pass over them - then they lose all moral and legitimate authority to enforce rules over pupils. This is a settled matter - the minister of education banned hair rules more than 15 years ago on the grounds that they intrude excessively on constitutional rights (including freedom of religion and freedom of expression) with no discernible reason or benefit for doing so.  The lack of enforcement is not an excuse for violating the rules and if the department of education will not enforce the rules, then it's up to the pupils to demand their rights themselves.  Of course it's not ideal to have strikes. But the onus on preventing this one was on the school.

Our courts have been that way now for decades.

Second - Trump has claimed for over a year now that the USA has widespread voter fraud, despite the fact there has never been ANY evidence of such.  This is what he tells himself, and his voters gobble it up, so he can feel better about losing the popular vote - something that was also done by the last Republican president as well.

This morning, I drove my Leaf to Alakea in 28 minutes.  Free parking and free charging.  With rail as it's currently proposed, our AM commute will extend to 90-120 minutes or 4 hours round trip.  Stopping at Middle Street will probably add at least 15-20 minutes to that figure.  It's funny that you all think you can decide what transit option we will use.  Our current express buses take 120 minutes daily.  Driving takes about 90 minutes daily.  Rail will be 240 minutes regardless if UH is in session or not.  It's pretty obvious what the current express bus riders will do when rail becomes the only public transit option.  End rail now.

They cut those trees out. The team that cleaned the park said they took out over 200 needles, condemns, drug paraphernalia, and bags of biohazard garbage. This park is behind a big church, on the side of a busy street and next to a good neighborhood. Their street corners are disgusting, imagine their camps!! They choose drugs & drink. They aren't trying to get a job. I agree getting teens off the street is important. They are easy prey & they don't have safe places to go. Most don't have safe homes. They need shelter, food, school and a support network. Kids don't necessarily have a choice, adult homeless CHOOSE to stay homeless.

0,"It is not about individual police officers who I suspect almost universally intend to do a good job.  It is about policies and tactics ordained and determined by the top brass, civilian politicians, and ultimately us since we are the ultimate bosses of the police.  It is essential to move beyond the focus on individual police officers.  When discussing our many wars, we do not blame individual soldiers for what they do unless their acts contradict orders.  In relation to wars, we more realistically ascribe responsibility to the politicians who gave the orders.  When we discuss police actions, we get focused on the individual officers and not the policies that guide them.  Those with involvement with the public safety/criminal justice system tend to get defensive and lose sight of the need to examine policy and tactics themselves independent of those who carry them out.   Whether to conduct high speed chases, especially in a city, is an important question.  Policy may save or cost lives

We have millions of Americans who believe, at their core, that self-interest is good and natural.   Social Darwinism and competition picks winners and losers.

0,"""""Start by believing"""" is a false narrative.   Many believed victims of sexual assault exist in cases where an accused is acquitted.  This is due to the fact that our law puts the accused's state of mind on trial and not the victims'.  A judge or jury can fully believe that the victims believe they were sexually assaulted and still acquit the accused because they do not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that they believed they were committing an assault.  The task for the police and the prosecutor, who owe a duty to everyone, is proceeding with cases where they believe there is a reasonable prospect of conviction.

0,"Normally I would not recommend this, but in Jack's circumstances I think it's worth serious consideration - because he doesn't wish to pass along anything from his estate after he dies AND he is concerned about longevity due to his good health - I think he should consider an annuity. Rates are low - I know, I know - but he is now 71 and much of his annuity payout will be more closely tied to his remaining life expectancy (versus interest rates).  With the $180k from his RRSP he could convert to a single, male annuity (with no guarantee) of approximately $1,000-1,100 per month - for the rest of his life regardless of interest rates, market returns, etc.  In addition, this is an opportune time to convert because he needs to move out of his RRSP this year (he has turned 71) AND converting to an annuity would do away with his concern about management fees and which investment management option to use after he converts his funds.  Just a suggestion - all the best, Jack.

0,"Dementia is commonly a disease of older people aged 65 and older but adults can develop it too anytime in their lives due to several reasons. Having a family history of dementia can be one. People with drinking habits, vitamin B deficiency or a history of chronic hypertension are at risk too. As explained earlier, it progresses slowly and symptoms varies which makes it difficult to diagnose at early stage. However, there is no proper screening tests for it yet, but a small assessment test has been designed to check the mental health of a patient called The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The test consists of questions to evaluate the mental state of the patient. The only way you can treat a dementia patient with is CARE. They are not different but quite similar to us however have a different way of taking things in!  Instead, love and care is only the medicine that can calm dementia parents for they are more sensitive and naïve. Reference:  http://bit.ly/2e5hYgU

Why does this only happen with conservative speakers? Why does the UO have a designated free speech zone when the entire campus, according to the 1st Amendment, is a free speech zone? Universities should be in the business of encouraging speech from all at any place and time with no thought of violence from anyone who does not like what they hear, sometimes even before they hear it. Until universities adjust their teaching to effectively accomplish this, they are part of the problem.

It would free up so many other resources to focus on bigger and better things, higher education, cures for diseases, real renewable energy. But even as a non profit org, we get money one of 2 basic ways.  1) or we earn it (which is most of our money) or 2) someone gives us some - someone else earned it.  We have no governemtn grants, those are all tax dollars. Who pays for A Minimum Income?

The word """"only"""", in your first paragraph does not negate that the mission of Jesus was to redeem us, it only, possibly, extends that (though one may argue that His redemption is an act of Love).  I don't think Jesus, as God, had to go along with anything that an ostensible series of prophets just made up. The way you describe sin sounds like it is simply part of our biology rather than a """"nature"""" that is reduced (fallen) through sin.  In such a case, Jesus might as well have come to free us from """"opposable thumbs"""" as from """"sin"""".

Imagine if, instead of the tens of thousands per state for abortions - the tens of millions of patients per state could show up with little to no previous medical history, screening, education, pre or post service assistance programs - no emergency care relationships, no emergency care facilities..  You really want less safety for patients?

0,"Some people are commenting that the DREAMers have no rights, the rationale being that undocumented immigrants have no legal status.  This is interesting, because different popular culture movies (Amistad, 12 Years..., and others) speak to the struggle to overcome just that barrier and gain recognition of human rights. Women have gone through the same struggle. They were dismissed as having no legal status, and legislators were urged to toss out their lawsuits, and toss them into gaol.  Time and again, when it has come down to human rights, the US has raised itself up, sometimes with great difficulty, and sometimes with conflict, and stood up for the most basic rights of people.  I know there are many people who would like to see that proud tradition come to an ignominious end, sooner rather than later, but my money is still on the great American heart that beats strong and true.

Yeah, I am sure that they are a reliable, un-biased source.  The EPA says that CO2 hisorically makes up 82% of greenhouse gases.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, CO2 levels were down 12% from 2005 to 2012.  """"The reductions in CO2 emissions are spread out among the different end-use sectors in proportion to the share of total electricity sales to each sector. Overall, the fuel-use changes in the power sector have accounted for 68% of the total energy-related CO2 reductions from 2005 to 2015.""""   That is from the EIA May 9, 2016 publication Energy Today.  This improvement is because coal is now down to 32% and NG is now up to 30% as fuel for the production of electricity.

To the contrary, we applaud his boldness in coming forward with a comprehensive plan featuring a combination of budget cuts, new revenues and using some reserves. We also applaud the legislature for making the budget the focus in the last days of the session.  As a Foundation working to improve the quality of life in Alaska, we hope the plan that is adopted is equitable in what it demands from Alaskans and puts the State on a path to long-term sustainability. According to this research, if only a portion of the Governor’s plan is adopted – budget cuts and Permanent Fund changes – without new revenues, the impact will fall mostly on middle-income working families and the poor, and barely, if at all, on the wealthy.  We offer this research in order to help answer important questions, not to support or oppose any specific plan or its author.

In this case, he probably saw a B-movie on cable TV, then imagined the Muslim ex-POTUS from Kenya was out to get him.  Imagine if Donald watches a movie about cigarettes being smuggled into the US from a foreign country.

In addition, Pew Research asked married, working parents whether they would like to drop to part time or drop out of work altogether to care for their kids. The results were heavily gender leaned. 60% of women said they'd prefer to not work at all. Only 19% of men said the same.  Until those attitudes change, in both men and women, the gaps will persist.

KLove is perfect for Denver because he can operate anywhere on the court, including the 3pt line, so he and Jokic can take turns guarding the paint.

Sometimes attributed to the US Marines. It's not from LGBT slang.  It is more likely to shock the homophobic than those who are gay. Both Putin and Trump are macho men, or pretend to be so. So to suggest they engage in a prison-like act of submission is derogatory.  It should be recalled that acts of same-sex submission is common in the animal world where hierarchy matters. That's where this slang comes from. It doesn't come from the LGBT world.  Is it offensive to the LGBT community? It can be. The LGBT community has been fighting stereotyping. This ain't that.

My experience is that these organizations are tokenism. They cover trivial matters while the major items are avoided.

Is Alberta's corporate income tax not still low despite the increase?  The oil sands emissions cap was set quite a bit higher than current levels. So, how is that a problem?

Wisdom literature reveals an ability to be patient with mystery and contradictions—and the soul itself. Wise people have always passed through a major death to their egocentricity. This is the core meaning of transformation. We have to go through interior deaths to reach the third stage of wisdom. Only here does contemplation and nondual thinking become possible; we can begin to learn to live with mystery and paradox and to develop true compassion. If stage one is order and stage two is disorder, then stage three is the final goal of reorder. There is no way around stage two! It is what Paul calls “the folly of the cross” (1 Corinthians ‪1:18‬).

It cannot possibly sustain such a large elderly population. The dwindling young and less skilled population already in trouble maintaining themselves, maintaining the standard of living. Japan culture cannot accept a large immigrant population to provide new blood, energy and idea. More and more Japan large corporations have to locate factories overseas. It is in the same outsource boat as America.  Don't be fooled by the Japan Self-Defense force. It is in fact a force with naval and air power greater than China.

0,"20 yrs ago when my daughter was born I took a yr of Women's Studies so I could understand the social issues facing her. The only man in the class, I learned that gender was something that society assigned to you; that society expected certain ROLES & behaviour (gender) from your biological assignment.  -- So I strove to raise my daughter GENDER-LESS. I attempted to counter gender influences by stressing the opposite. So she received trucks as toys, tool kits & was told that Barbys were stupid. Many of her friends were boys playing with swords, hiking & tree-climbing. As a teen she fell in with the gay kids & the odds. As an adult she wants to be a man & rejects that old time feminist argument that gender is a set of social expectations and dress. Gender is a valued RIGHT!  -- Today leftists & feminists insist that gender roles R a choice. Well, looks like I programmed my child to make the only choice available to s/him: the gender role that s/he was immersed in. Failed experiment.

Just look at the statistics EPD themselves publishes after each one of the large-scale temporary traffic enforcement operations they've done. In one, they watched traffic on Beltline all day long and didn't manage to see even ONE PERSON make an incorrect lane change.  When traffic enforcement is anemic and always consists entirely of pointing a radar gun, there's no reason at all to expect that they'll suddenly start pulling over distracted drivers.

0,"I've ridden this roller coaster for over 40 years. When mineral prices are up, investors invest. When prices are down, they pull their money and write off the loss. They spend the money trying to develop a property when the mineral prices are up, When in fact they should have done that while the prices are down so they would be poised to produce when prices go up. Then when the market tanks before they can produce, Their money is lost as well as their stomach for trying again. It's and endless cycle of buying high and selling low. Echo Bay pulled out of the AJ when gold was $265 an ounce. They cited the need for prices to be at least $350 per ounce to start to make a profit. They weren't gone long before gold jumped to $1,900/oz and still holding around $1,200. They could have been making bank today, even with that low grade ore. Now CBJ wants to start it up again to produce revenue. Again, buying high. Risky business? Yes. But not as risky as starting up on the backside of the apex.

0,"Andre'e, this crisis was created by populist Republicans abetted by their Bush Democrat caucus members. They hyperstimulated the Alaskan economy to avoid the lower 48 recession. I was listening to a radio program today relating the story of how Alaska is facing serious recession after more than 30 years.  Our Legislators and previous Governor were going to pay for their effort by stimulating oil production (SB21) then  stand back to  reap the benefits and bask in their superior ability. Unfortunately, their entire half-baked Keynesian economic scheme detonated in their faces just after Walker was elected (and I tend to believe Parnell was rejected as much as Walker was elected).   What they didn't count on was the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia fearing for its' existence and flooding the market with cheap oil to both generate short term wealth and drive competition from the market. If you think Alaska has problems be thankful (for many reasons anyway) that you don't live in Saudi Arabia.

While people can change their minds, there is no evidence that Trump did. When Chris Matthews asked Trump about his evolution on abortion, it was immediately evident that Trump had not given the issue so much as five minutes of thought. Over the next six hours, he adopted four different positions on abortion. Trump has said that he will nominate """"pro-life"""" justices to the Supreme Court. However, the prism through which he'll nominate is not abortion -- he'll be looking for judges who are sympathetic to his business interests and who will not oppose him as he privatizes the presidency. Some may vote to overturn Roe, but that would be only a coincidence; and it won't prevent one abortion.

0,"Scientifically gathered statistics say otherwise. The US unquestionably has one of the very highest rates of gun deaths of any developed nation, and far too many are children. But gun culture dogma knows statistics and facts are a liberal media conspiracy, and why rational scientific study of the issue by the government is banned by law. Yes I do keep a loaded gun in my house, but I live alone, obey rigid safety protocol and secure it under lock and key when I have guests, particularly kids. In my opinion anyone that maintains an accessible loaded gun in a house with children is nuts. That child is vastly more likely to be the gun victim than an intruder.

Unfortunately the man grew up in a society that does not look at the person's background but at his appearance. Recently his wife was called an ape by a public official. If I'm missing Konrad's thesis, it's because it's tied up in so many knots to be impenetrable.  The author then claims Boyden's only sin was being overenthusiastic about a heritage he may or may not have inherited. Doublespeak much?! One can write intelligently and with sensitivity about a community by immersing himself into a culture - while acknowledging they remain an outsider. The ethics of Boyden's claims aside, I feel he may have usurped the awards and bursaries that should have gone to someone else.  It is theft.

I observe the behavior of city officials at neighborhood board meetings and view these bureaucrats as being pompous, self righteous and unwilling to even entertain the simplest request that are put forth. The mayors inability to lead HART, the poor performance of the police commission, the Kapalama Hale debacle, rampant homeless and the publics perception of corruption and inefficiencies have defined Caldwell's past four years as mayor.  I normally refrain from such harsh criticism but this city administration is flawed in so many ways.  Thank you.

I will not support a referendum, a law, an ordinance, a bill, a whatever that takes my one lil Alaskan vote and my rural views and makes it irrelevant to a possibly more numerous but stateside urban view. The chances of our electoral vote ever being a loud voice in a national election are miniscule, but at least I know my voice is heard here. The voice of Alaska is outnumbered by the sheer number of voters in Seattle. The electoral college was formulated, in part, to help protect the states and the minority from the will of the majority - we've all heard the adage of the wolves and the sheep voting on what's for dinner. Well, I do not want to be on anyone's plate, but you can bet that if you allow your voice (vote) to be beholden to the wolf in someone else's state, you'll soon find yourself egged, battered and hanging slightly above boiling oil.

Doc Halladay was the quintessential professional who always came prepared to play and battled to the end even with his worst stuff.  Hard core baseball fans like me will most remember the no hitter he pitched in the 2010 post season for Philadelphia in which he was unbelievable, giving up just a walk to keep him from equaling Don Larsen's 1956 perfect game in the world series.  It was his 2nd no hitter in 2010!  Leaving aside Roger Clemens two MVP-Cy Young seasons with the club, Doc Halladay was one of the 3 greatest pitchers ever to suit up for Toronto.  The others are Dave Stieb and Jim Clancy.  All 3 had 16 seasons in The Show and closely matched stats.  But Doc had the lowest career era, most wins and fewest losses on average, most strike outs per IP and was the guy you wanted when it counted most.  Thanks for the memories, Doc and RIP.

For evidence of how to successfully treat this social disease, turn to Australia. They dealt with it by enacting widespread gun control legislation and reduced their gun violence problem to near elimination, saving countless lives. The fact that people like you value gun ownership over simple human live makes you part of the mountain the top from which this killer and others like him persist.

If foreign language is good for college students, it's good for all levels of public school curriculum.

0,"I would envision more than one presenter and another presenter who does not have the problems Burke has with changes introduced by Pope Francis  Other cardinals and bishops who are expert in Canon Law are not having the same problems Burke and his cohort are having.  I don't have a problem with Burke having a stage to present his views.   I have a problem with him being the only one on the stage and those attending not hearing other viewpoints.  I think it matters that what the Pope wants and has envisioned as possible is probably not going to be positively presented.  If all you """"learn"""" at a conference is everything that is bad or difficult, how does that help you see other ways in which the same thing can be seen as helpful and good?

Trudeau sent 350 minions to Paris to party on the taxpayers dime then gave away billions of money that was not his.  Spending other people's money to buy popularity is the hesis for his UN seat just as he is willing to spend soldiers blood in Iraq and is desperately seeking another conflict to aid his chances.  Carbon taxes will hurt his economy and the prospect of spending billions to purchase international credits is loathsome to ignore and will not impact climate.  The CPP rollback was not supportable by the demographics and is another burden on our children. We will need to hold our breath on pipelines.

Those who cannot adapt should be deported.  But Quebec must regain the right, as should every other western society, to impose its culture on immigrants. Europe shows us our future if we do not do so.  Moreover, if we fail to destroy the evil influences of Islamic fundamentalism, our own moderate Muslims will become victims.  Eventually if we collapse into chaos European-style, I cannot imagine what the USA will do to us. Prepare for invasion.

But, put in place a carbon tax that adds $30 to the cost of the old 'high carbon' method, now it is $130 for the 'old' way or $110 for the new 'lower carbon' method, so they switch the process.  The cost of Tom's Widget World's widget has gone up by $10.  The government received $0 in new revenue and therefore doesn't add this in to their """"revenue neutral"""" calculations, but you and I still need to foot the bill when we buy this widget.

This passing of the blame to churches fails to acknowledge the very strong role that government and wider society played.  The schools were chronically underfunded.  The federal government was responsible for inspection and oversight of the schools.  Government reports detailed the problems early on.  Yet they did not stop it.  And in many cases explicitly approved practices such as carrying out nutritional experiments on children in their care.   Contracting the operation of schools out to the churches did not absolve the government and Canadian society of their responsibility.

Besides that, how many times Trump called for action against the media who criticized him? Trump's immigration views are appealing to the alt right. David Duke, former KKK-leader, expressed that too in Charlottesville. The law should be changed, denying those who are promoting nazi ideas, violence, hatred, bigotry and racism! More than 400,000 American soldiers are laid to rest in the soil of Europe and other places after fighting the nazi's and their rotten ideas! They fought for liberty of mankind but not for spreading nazi ideas, hatred, bigotry, racism and violence! This must stop!

Mr. Levesque was many things - an excellent journalist, a charismatic character, a skilled politician and a political leader who changed the political landscape in Quebec for a couple of generations.  He may even be said to have been a great Quebecer and so provincial funding for his museum is appropriate.  But he was not a great Canadian and federal support for his museum is the sort of half baked notion that only someone like Little Potato who believes all the good PMs of the last century were from Quebec and that Canada is the world's first post national state without a common identity, culture or values would embrace.  Levesque was a traitor to Canada - a civilized, democratic, fascinating one but nonetheless a traitor.  Museums and monuments to his life and career should not be funded by TROC.

Under our current system we have a Liberal majority government voted for by fewer than 25% of the eligible electorate, while 60% of that electorate showed up at the polls to actually vote against the government we have. This was also true of the previous Conservative government. It's been true of many other governments historically, which may explain why voter turnout is so low - the process is essentially a waste of time for the many people who live in """"safe"""" ridings (i.e. ridings that are virtually impossible for other parties to win - so, for example,  if 60% of your riding is guaranteed to vote for a party you don't like, you might as well stay home rather than vote).

Mennonite women with long skirts and wearing bonnets or nuns wearing dresses to show modesty seem as much out of touch with a liberal and more secular world.

Operational changes both good and bad, but from our point of view, mostly bad. The establishment of campground hosts, in exchange for free camping for the season was a big plus. But bringing in specialty management firms and putting our hosts (and others) on the payroll,  has resulted in less options for visiting and higher camping fees.   Privatization doesn't meld seamlessly as some politicians like to portray.  In reality, by turning a publicly run operation over to private enterprise, their operational costs will not be less, and they factor in their profit on top of it. Not only does this impede our access, but by increase fees, it puts camping in our public parks out of reach for a many of our population.   The poor & working poor don't have disposable income for expensive camping fees.

The Russians hack the Americans, the Americans hack the Germans, who hack the Brits, who hack the Chinese, who in turn hack us. Every conceivable permutation of political hacking will be going on.  The reasons why are obvious. Political parties are easy targets. They don't have government-grade cyber-security. But at the same time the intelligence obtained there could be near-government quality. Better yet, government networks don't hold the political dirt, whereas a political party's might. Where better to find incriminating tidbits that might be exploited?  Spying on political parties in foreign nations is one of the oldest games in the trade.

I merely wanted to point out the hypocrisy notably evident, hoping it might give pause for deeper reflection. As to our democracy, I’m not sure it matters any longer to some.  Remember that Prop 8 passed, in a very democratic manner: the people voted.  Yet that didn’t matter to some on the court(s).  When democracy fails to provide specific outcomes, one side tends to fall back on the judiciary.  The problem I have with such tactics is that the will of the people is replaced by the opinions of the few who are actually supposed to uphold the law, not legislate it.

I have stated before in Civil Beat, handing the nuclear codes to either Ms. Clinton or Mr. Trump is the equivalent of handing a loaded firearm to a four year old.  As one reader pointed out, our crystal balls are certainly clouded to where we cannot foresee what will happen in either of the potential administration.  We cannot lay the blame for what happens on one person or one administration either.  It is a collection of decisions that influence where and what happens.  Unfortunately, the 'why' and the unintended consequences are not thoroughly explored.  I'm sure there are people (civil servants) who argued against involvement in Vietnam (my war), Iraq and Afghanistan but were overruled by political higher-ups and for political convenience.

I figure about 2K years ago, after circat 1.5K years of preparation, was just about the earliest the incarnation could have happened with any hope of the reality of the historical Christ being passed down through history with reasonable accuracy.  IMHO, revelation, in the broadest sense of the Holy Spirit whispering in the inmost being of humans, has been going on from the beginning (200K years) and involves guidance of every possible sort; and I have no doubt it continues today.

It's the job of police to analyze the evidence before them. If the evidence is weak, such as when a witness offers conflicting statements of fact, or is untruthful, charging is dubious. Even if an assault did take place, the likelihood of conviction in those cases is small. Furthermore, proceeding with the charges will put the victim through the legal wringer that the author criticizes. She'll have to testify, and her every word will be rigorously challenged by a defence lawyer. Then she may watch the accused walk free.

0,"Okay, Corey, explain the GOP fuzzy math.  We already have an annual budget deficit and a overall debt approaching 20 trillion (thank you George W Bush).  How is cutting taxes for the rich going to make our deficits and debt decrease?  That's all; just that.  Explain that and please skip the part about cutting taxes increases the economy and therefore tax collections.  See Kansas and Oklahoma state budgets to dispel that once more.  ps:  Reaganomics only """"worked"""" because Reagan added 3 trillion to the deficit.  There are some tax cuts or credits that do work:  money going to the working class and the poor IMMEDIATELY go back into the economy.  Any cuts going to the rich just get put into a off shore bank because the rich already have bought the toys they wanted.

Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.” (Romans 1:27)  “Do not allow a sorceress to live.” (Exodus 22:18)  “I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.” (1 Timothy 2:12)  So, as you can see, there are similar beliefs in other religions as well.

I wanted a taller vehicle that would be easier to get in and out of. The LEAF was directly comparable to a Honda HR-V, Mazda CR-3, and Mitsubishi RVR in terms of ride height; 5 passenger leg, hip and head room; and cargo space. Basically, I traded all-wheel drive for all-electric drive and I couldn't be happier. I typically drive 80-90 km/day (30,000 km/year) and can recharge overnight on an ordinary 110V outlet. I don't miss going to the gas station and I'm saving about $3,000 a year. For me, small turbocharged 4-cylinder engines and laggy CVTs are too noisy and sluggish compared to the incredibly quiet, smooth and responsive acceleration of the LEAF. I continue to be amazed by regenerative braking, one-pedal driving, and how seldom I have to use the brakes in North Van's hills.

I don't see how any reasonable person would have a problem with that.

0,"With respect, disaffected government employees and the media appear very united in a common cause, a concerted effort to force this president out of office, effectively overturning the November 2016 election.  Consider what must be at stake if their intent is to propagandize Americans into believing the Russians hacked their election.  The election must therefore be invalidated, no?  So Congress must stop what it's doing, beginning with stopping progress on all the Trump-era reforms, and fix this major big huge problem, control the riots, and prevent the dollar from being devalued in domestic markets and sold off in world financial markets.  Point was the potential consequences should give even the most rabid anti-Trumpist pause for thought.

0,"Do corporations get to say “yes” and “no”?  I'm not sure why this question is paramount? To me, more important concern is whether elected governments, both federal and provincial, will retain the right to say """"yes"""" and """"no"""" where resource development is concerned or otherwise be subordinated to a broad aboriginal veto. I'm not overly concerned about the UNDRIP due to the fact that such declarations generally have greater moral than legal impact and by-and-large aren't enforceable. I believe the greater risk is that a government keen to prove its credibility on aboriginal issues could align our administrative and legal processes to comply with the declaration before understanding its real impacts and implications.

On the one hand, he is right - the beneficiaries of apartheid are also the landowners today, through inheritances, trusts and opportunities unavailable to the majority of the black population.  That The State is the largest landowner already is irrelevant. add to that the tribal trust lands, which probably pushes the % to near 60. Add present black-owned land to that, and land ownership, other than white, is clearly the largest by far.  On the other hand, it's the perception that counts, and the fact that the easiest political route is to threaten the status quo with nationalisation.  No black politician will start the process to disenfranchise the chiefs and entitle the occupiers of trust land. It's an obvious solution to the land issue, but will mean political suicide.  Another solution is to provide just land, and let people build their own dwellings, but this blunts the patronage tool....

0,"Very hard to see what any god (theist) has to do with health care. One of the fundamental problems in the Canadian non-system is that it is not single or unique. Each Province and Territory has its own system. Then there are separate systems for prisoners, for military, for refugees, and there is gross disparity between those who have work funded benefits that pay for extras in hospital and for medication, physiotherapy etc., compared with the self-employed who do not have such benefits. The Federal input is in funding, which they meet to a lesser and lesser extent as time goes by, but still expect to control -- and one of the most ridiculous controls (shared with Cuba and North Korea),  is the block to privately operated treatment facilities. One day this ultra-socialist stand will have to be abandoned, and the longer it is maintained the poorer will be our health care.

His teaser middle class tax cut (which wasn't entirely a net new cut as it replaced income splitting and a higher TFSA limit), is now being clawed back by nickel and by dime (and in some cases much higher).  New alcohol 'levy' secretly indexed to inflation.  Cancelled transit tax credit.  Carbon tax.  Higher payroll tax.  Now internet tax.

0,"Yet, my comments are specifically directed at the matter of needed dialogue.  In the Catholic Church, dialogue is not a real option because the hierarchy in the past and present have made it impossible.  It will take a very powerful, Church-wide response to blast a door or window open in the Vatican to have any dialogue with the laity even start.  I know all about the withholding of donations to the Church in general, and of redirection of them (my religious community has even benefitted from that) to specific church agencies/programs, and I also know how that has not helped one bit in getting the bishops to talk with the rest of the Church.  You know that - but seem content to leave it there and resort to punishment.  For those of us who choose to stay and continue to push for a truly universal Church of all he baptized, there is only one way to create the foundation for it: talk.

1,"while an audit of part numbers show what happened in the past, the fact is, that it is past any mistake done cannot be undone.  I am sure hart knows much about the failures of the project and hopefully will not repeat itself.  the audit will likely result in pointing fingers but again, nothing can be done to undo the situation.  if there were any criminal acts committed then it should be dealt with.  however, a normal financial audit does not look to uncover criminal acts, if any acts are uncovered the it is a coincidental.  a better audit would be a forensic audit, which will delve into possible misdeeds by individuals.  I doubt though that there were any intentional misdeeds done, it anything it was due to inexperience or stupidity.  In any government project, unintentional errors are not consequentlal, only ones that obviously  criminal.

It will do the opposite. Tracking is very complicated and very expensive. We now have thousands of pages of ever changing rules  no one understands. Over regulation has driven family farms and mom and pop businesses out replacing them with businesses owned by wealthy investors. But these bigger businesses are not more compliant, they are just more sophisticated at breaking rules. The result is higher prices at legal stores so lots of people return to the underground market, which is now bigger than ever. The answer is to have a simple system where everyone can participate. This will result in the least black market and the most tax revenue. The only way to stop diversion to other states is to end federal prohibition. Trump could fix this by letting states impose lean effective regulation,  but he won't.

It is unimportant what people are being paid elsewhere---it is not as if a county commissioner can just move to another place and be a county commissioner. The timing of this raise is suspect---the rule for raises requires that a general election occur between the raise and the implementation of that raise presumably so that those voting for the raise could in fact be deposed prior to the effective date of the raise thus working as a control on the inclination to vote oneself raises...yet in this instance there in no time left for the raise itself to affect the election---no time for an opposition to gather impetus and unseat the commission or even individual members of the commission. The amount is foul as well---since the last raise there is no individual period of productivity increases in the county nor performance improvement of the commissioners anywhere close to 13.7%...rather poor performance as displayed by this vote.

As a result of heavy political lobbying California gave out free emission allowances to certain industries which caused the oversupply. Ontario is in the process of doing the same. Under the cap and trade scheme, the only people who actually pay carbon taxes are poor consumers struggling to make ends meet. The wealthy and politically connected get a free pass. Cap and trade is just another """"steal from the poor and give to the rich"""" scheme that is pretending to be progressive.

0,"Focusing too much attention on gun laws while failing to deal with important underlying problems has proved to leave us with more problems rather than fewer.  When Reagan was shot gun control was the first response.  At the same time people were released from mental institutions and funding for community mental health was cut. Mass killing are frequently associated with suicide. Suicide attempts and other forms of self-destructive cause much suffering and some deaths.  Both community mental health and education can help prevent more serious outcomes. When Columbine happened I hoped that educational practices would be changed instead of a focus on gun control. Things like mass killings and suicides have a certain contagious aspect.  Amok behavior was reported in an area of the South Pacific in the 1800s that seemed to be a part of that culture. If we care about real improvement the conversation must go beyond gun control.

I would be concerned that if a limited number of reservations were permitted for some parks and/or features, the National Park Service would have similar experiences with these types of reservations as well.  On the other hand, overuse by visitors is a legitimate concern for both the resources and for the visitor enjoyment of the parks/monuments.

Correct, 1800 is that more or less than the total in 2016. . Very good. Solar energy IS growing. .

Racists, non-racists, Native Americans, and Africans fought for the CSA.  Additionally, the CSA was not fighting to overthrow the USA, they were fighting to secede from the USA.  Just so I and others don't have to endure another knucklehead long e-mail string, let me make this clear:  slavery is an evil and stain on mankind; past, present, and future.  The right side won the Civil War, the USA.  Racism and discrimination of any kind by anyone is not only illegal but morally and ethically wrong.  But physically attacking those who do not believe the way I do is also illegal, immoral, and unethical.  Additionally, not everyone who displays a CSA flag is a racist or supports racists.  There are appropriate places for CSA monuments and named places/things in the USA.

The fallout from possible compromise could be immediate or it could take months/years to reveal itself.

The two leaders of democracy realize that globalization has weakened their nation states and given power to entities like the EU and the UN. In the meantime Trudeau has declared Canada the first post nation state! He is going against the tide of democracy as practiced in democratic nations and just doesn't understand that we are just not ready for a world without borders .... maybe in a thousand years.

We are strong nowhere, and vulnerable everywhere. The next big war could easily go nuclear, and a priority on civil defense would be more immediately valuable to our citizens, than any number of tanks and aircraft.

0,"What happened in the Alberta PC leadership race was unfortunate.  Hopefully Kenney doesn't win it as I think Alberta still needs a moderate centre-right option not a hard right one.  Hard right only sells well in Rural Alberta, not the two cities where the party needs to regain support.  In addition I am not sure the two parties need to unite to defeat the NDP.  Outside Edmonton, NDP support is very soft so I suspect voters will probably coalesce like they do in BC around whichever is most likely to keep them out.  BC had the same issue in the 90s, but there was never a merger, instead those who wanted to keep the NDP out coalesced around the BC Liberals who have been in power since 2001 and despite 16 years in power still have a decent shot a re-election this spring.

0,"U.S. people are brainwashed by the idea of manifest destiny (this land is your land, this land is my land, except it was violently stolen from indigenous people), and we are also taught to romanticize European colonialism. It's a hard thing to unlearn, but coming to know the facts about how lands were conquered and how colonial subjects were treated makes one realize that things were a lot less rosy than they are in our collective imagination. I'm also interested in food history and the impact that colonialism had on indigenous food cultures, but glorifying colonialism as a restaurant theme is that same romanticization divorced from what colonialism actually was; oppressive, exploitative, bloody, brutal, and destructive. Sure, cultural conquest has been going on since the beginning of time. But in this generation, the descendants of colonizers still largely benefit from their ancestors' legacy, while the formerly colonized have not yet fully recovered. Is that to be celebrated?

At the end of the day though, its Girl Guide policy to allow even illegal immigrants to Canada as members in their organization and if they choose not to travel to the US based on travel restrictions placed on those members then that's their choice too. This was an issue before Trump though and this is nothing more than grandstanding.

0,"The new order no longer barrs permanent residents or green card holders. It also doesn't barr dual citizens. It is also only for 90 days, 120 for refugees. Why because documents, such as passports, from those affected  countries can be bought on any street corner, even Europe is recognising this. So 90 days gives the US border agency time to figure out other ways of dealing with immigrants and travellers from those affected countries where documents aren't worth the paper they are printed on.  As to Iran, that is mainly due to Iranian officials not releasing traveller infomration to their counterparts in other countries. Iran basically has only itself to blame even if it has rigorous and secure passports and identity documentation.  So much hyperbole over a 90 day ban ,also a huge sense of entitlement from these academics....and very anecdotal.

The donations came from the Grameen Bank the country’s most famous micro-credit bank, and which Yunus was the chairman until he was removed.  And that’s when Hillary Clinton usurped her authority as Secretary of State and personally called Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina demanding that Dr. Muhammed Yunus be reinstated despite federal ethics laws that require government officials to recuse themselves from matters that could impact their spouse’s business.

In today's Keynesian economy, Trump walking away from a trade deal (for instance NAFTA) means eliminating a $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico ($200 per person) and more importantly capital expenditures in the tens to hundreds of billions will likely shift from overseas facilities and equipment to the U.S. Some examples of this have been seen with automotive production with companies such as Ford, GM, Chrysler, Magna, Linamar, Delphi, Borg Warner, Martinrea and others moving from Canada/U.S. to Mexico.  Also on World trade, rather than buying Samsung and LG TVs built in South Korea, there is a better chance that a Canadian manufacturer could be created for Canadian buyers. That would be pretty incredible.  I have no idea how this does not make sense. I can get into a real debate as I think it is educational for the Canadian public.

Quite the opposite - we are pleaded with by our priests to all come together & have parish vocation meetings so that we can pray to have more men to ordain because ordination is so important.  If lay people don't fight bad things like optional celibacy being offered to men for priesthood while we are not ordaining women priests we have no one to blame but ourselves for gender segregation, and the sacramental slavery of women by men in our church.  Nothing starts or continues in a church without at least the cooperation or complacency of the majority of the people.  Women are voiceless because we do not demand equality, & therefore women are also to blame and are partakers, in the sexism, our church brings to the world which ends in poverty, violence, rape and physical slavery.

Hamilton wrote in The Federalist Papers No. 68: """"The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors  The vote was limited to white men who owned property.

If you have traveled to a country that requires entry and exit visas you would not like to repeat the experience. While traveling to Hong Kong I required a entry visa, they gave me a slip of paper to return to them when I exited. I took the 40 min ferry to Macau (another Chinese territory) and was required to return my HK visa, they gave me a Macau entry visa and slip of paper to return to them when I left Macau. I did so the same day and I returned to HK and repeated the process.  It was good for the Chinese because they could keep track of every visitor but it was a royal pain.

""""Pot Raises As Much Money As Alaska’s 2013, Parnell-Era Oil Production tax: Well, that’s true in two of the next four years.  Here are some somewhat startling numbers from the Alaska Department of Revenue.  Even as oil prices are forecast to rise, starting in 2018 Oil and Gas Production Taxes will only raise $15.7.  They will fall to $10.7 million in 2019, and we’ll receive only $12.5 million in Oil and gas Production taxes in 2020.  What about taxes from marijuana?  Well, pot is projected to raise $12 million a year.  That’s more than our Production Tax will raise in 2019 and about the same as Production taxes raise in 2020.""""

The expense for these adds were not included in the election spending quota's as they were deemed third party.  With one of the first orders of business was to reform some of the union funding and organizational changes that the previous gov't put in place, I would suggest that Mr Gerald Butts is looking to establish the Working Families Coalition as a federal force for the Liberals for the next election.

Instead, it is my suspicion, that they are barking about the deal now but will possibly have just enough NI legislators vote for it. That will allow them to both look like they are talking for their constituents while also appeasing a power base that is pushing for this deal to pass.  That power base is linked up with the inheritors of Senator Inouye's power base. And they are on the move, growing and becoming influential by the day. Just sayin.

0,"Thanks for at least reading the Wikis.  It is a start. The Swiss culture is quite different from ours, so I tend to agree it might not work here.  They are generally much better educated than we are.  On the other hand, having guns at home IS the Swiss military.  If we kept all our soldiers in their homes, we could close a lot of military bases, here and overseas.  We spend a crazy large amount on our military compared to EVERYBODY else, so it'd be way cheaper the Swiss way. I don't follow your reasoning on the Aussie model.  Are you saying it would take more police per capita here to do what they do there because we have 81% urban vs their 89%? Why?  Besides, if we had way fewer gun murders that would lessen the burden on police.  Are you saying they have no criminals in Australia?  Are you saying we should have no laws of any kind because someone will break them?

0,"The U.S. Constitution is not sacred; it can be changed for good--the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery--or bad--the 18th Amendment prohibiting alcohol that not only incarcerated thousands of people but led to a rise in organized crime, as the bootlegging of alcohol became an ever-more lucrative operation.  The level of gun violence in America is appalling and thus far nothing effective is being done about it. Whether it's the guns or the people who wield them, what we're doing is not working. It appears that studies support the premise that fewer guns result in less gun violence and doesn't lead to an increase in violence by other means, but an overall reduction.  Nevertheless, the gun lobby remains resolute and unwilling to compromise.  In the case of the Second Amendment and militias, with the majority of Americans wanting some form of viable gun control I don't think it's a big reach that constitutional modification may be in the offing if things continue on the way they have.

That is, until a judge sentenced a criminal, Mychal Bell;  then the black community along with the lying, progressive MSM was up in arms.

Especially since she used her accounts, making them especially vulnerable, while traveling in those countries, China and Russia, among others.  Since she was Secretary of State, a position that would of course be targeted by foreign intelligence agencies, I would think that a reasonable person would assume that an intrusion to her account would be attempted. Had it been authorized and secured by the pertinent government agencies, then one could assume that it was fairly protected from that intrusion. Not so with Hillary's accounts.

For him to step away from that and launch his own campaign has till now been too big a step, even though he has the funds and wealthy backers to do so.  Now it might be too late.  Secondly he is not Zulu or Xhosa.  Those who say that does not matter have not spent time in the highly populated rural areas from the Swaziland borders down to Port Elizabeth.  The ANC has a reservoir of at least five million and possibly 10 million votes there, intricately woven into tribal structures which unscrupulous sorts (you know who I mean) are happy to mobilize when needed.  Ramaphosa could have unwoven the tribal weave by building on his cross-tribe union skills but did not.  His union skills have withered through neglect and through the unions being corrupted.

0,"Bonnie, I appreciate your comments and the link.  Always nice to have this kind of input and follow up.  I really don't dispute that the LSRR methodology is more comprehensive and is bound to produce more accurate and meaningful results.  But human nature being what it is when it comes to personal finance my suspicion is that for many people (if not most) the quality of the data will be the weak link.  Between the willingness to commit the time and the ability to reasonably estimate their current and future scenarios the margin of error can be significant.  Which is why the replacement ratio exists or persists - it is relatively quick and easy to compute and provides individuals with a general guideline of where they should expect to be.  For my own purposes I have always employed an approach that would be closer to the LSRR - but I am fairly confident that I devote a lot more time to personal finance than the average person.

0,"Professor, let me see if I understand this. You were absolutely incensed by the Access Hollywood tapes, but you set that all aside -- as well as everything else Trump has done throughout his life when he spoke the words you wanted to hear about abortion -- once in a debate.  Did you pay attention during the debate where he praised Planned Parenthood? Since you are so worried about the steel industry, do you know where he got the steel to build Trump Tower in Manhattan? Since you are concerned about American workers and jobs, do you know where the Trump line of clothing is made? Did the thought occur to you when you heard the words you wanted to hear that this was a huckster trying to close the sale?  As for abortion, are you aware of what happened to the nation's abortion rate the last time a Clinton was in office? Like MikeAA said, you want to do something about abortion, then do something about extending health care. And CHIP -- Hillary's idea -- had a dramatic effect in the 1990s.

0,"I have been a family physician for 45 years and during that time have seen the number of pharmaceuticals used by Canadians sky rocket. This increase has largely occurred as a result of treatment guidelines developed by 'experts' in the various specialties. While some of this drug use has been beneficial the unfortunate reality is that many of the guidelines are based on weak evidence or simply on 'expert' opinion with no science to support. These weakly supported guidelines would include very common targets for blood pressure, blood sugar, statin use in diabetes among others. In my work with Elders in nursing homes it is not unusual to have them arrive on 10, 15 or even 20 drugs. There is little to no evidence for this polypharmacy in frail old people - they are excluded from drug trials. Money from drug companies has corrupted modern medicine. While not all guideline writers are corrupt, enough are that we must suspect them all - and the rest are mostly silent. Shame on medicine.

0,"Well, with exception to the World Cup which only happens once per four years, ratings for women's soccer is generally very low, even when it is widely available.  Revenue and ease of viewership are strongly correlated.  Are revenues higher because it's easier to access?  Absolutely.  But the networks also have a strong incentive in displaying whatever programming will give them the best viewership so that they can charge the highest rate for advertising.  People suggesting that networks are actively sabotaging women's soccer is a bit of a stretch and wouldn't make much sense for the network, as it would limit their revenue. It's a large reason why new sports are extremely hard to start up (not implying women's soccer is new) and why network television can only support so many sports. Only 3 women's matches are in the top 25 of most widely viewed matches in US history, and they're all finals games.

No more payout to the Catholics, the french, the natives, the feminists etc. Divide Canada into separate countries if need be. _ 5) Move to a Lassez faire system.

0,"Mahalo for this piece.  Although I disagree with Professor Milner (making it easier for people to register overtime does increase participation), I found this an interesting look on where registration has increased and consideration of various factors.  My only suggestion would be to avoid the trap that others have fallen into when comparing Hawaii's voter turnout to nationwide averages.  While General turnout is low, Primary turnout is one of the highest in the Nation.  2016 primary: Hawaii saw 34.7% turnout compared to 28.5% nationwide.  Even that was considered high for the nation, which usually hovers in the teens for primaries.  It may be interesting to consider the reasons why (e.g. many contests are determined in the primaries in Hawaii; Hawaii votes have little if any impact on Presidential general elections); however, it is important to make the distinction.  Participation is not nearly as dismal as the picture is often painted.

Thus, he inserts a comparison of eucharist for divorced/remarried after a process to Canada and euthanasia. First - these are completely different questions and issues Second - his view of eucharist ignores the history of catholic tradition and sacrament understanding.  For hundreds of years, eucharist was a sacrament of reconciliation and mercy - it is not given just to those who are *perfect*. Third - kag1982 hits another Douthat knee jerk.  He is a convert (use this term for him deliberately) and thus is threatened by John XXIII's desire to address the greatest scandal - Christianity's divisions as scandal.  Douthat sees this as black and white; church makes right.

0,"(continued) I would seriously suggest crunching the numbers on pop. growth as a driver though. I don't see it. The Lower Mainland growth #s right now are lower than they were a decade or two ago, when prices were relatively flat. When you look at housing completions against the total # of people coming to the region, it's seems more than enough supply is being made.  It is those with their hands on the policy levers (gov't, gov't agencies) that have chosen this course. We are overly comfortable with the twin grotesqueries of easy debt (an explosion in gov't-guaranteed mortgage debt, a laundry list of boutique tax treatments for real estate) and foreign money laundering. The rapid (~30%) devaluation of the CAD against the USD and CNY at the exact time when foreign capital aggressively started looking for a home made things worse. And the financial hit many took in 08/09 created enough voters to support real estate hyperinflation to make up for their loss (forget sustainability).

It seems with the current housing crisis and bubble many landlords are gouging consumers (i.e. renters).  Is it the supply vs. demand economics at work or are landlords adding a premium to rental costs for consumers (or both)?  Attorney's for the landlord are coming away all the richer.

In the proper hands, negotiating a new free trade arrangement with the US whether as part of a revised NAFTA or a bilateral deal like the former FTA should be a relative piece of cake.  After all, Canada has not had a huge trade surplus with the US nor imported many jobs from the US nor been unpopular with the American people.  And this is a time when the US administration wants at keep least two reliable trading partners ((the UK and us).  Too bad we cut off those hands in 2015

Deacons have no more authority or vote or voice in our church than do laity.

0,"Yes.  There is a great need to revisit the stories on which much of our faith is based, certainly the basic Garden of Eden stories, ideas of original sin, ideas of what is a sin, the idea that the Jewish faithful were more precious to God than all others He imbued with human life, the idea that the Bible is God's Word, rather than the wisdom of the ages and the cultures in which the stories were written.  We need a mythology and philosophy that recognizes we evolved and are evolving, that we cannot """"know"""" God, even though He put a yearning in our minds and hearts to seek Him.   We have to be able to admit we can only find some aspect of God in imperfect forms of metaphor and allegory and we need to be able to take new knowledge and adapt/change/create the metaphor and allegory that reflects our new understandings.  In other words, there is no infallible-for-all-time dogma.  We need to learn to be humble.  Some need that lesson rather badly.

However, overuse of wood in design of modern buildings tends to bring a heaviness and sameness that grows old quickly.  I love the lightness of the tent, glass, and steel we see now at DIA.

The bulk of his supporters are not true conservatives, they are a conglomeration of working class and middle class people who feel their way of life is threatened by open borders in both the physical and economic sense. To maintain their standard of living, most of these people have to work two or more jobs. Yes, the American economy is growing, but not for them. It grows for Apple, GM, Dow Corning, Citibank, Google and Microsoft, but not for Smalltown America. Everybody ignored them. Trump said he would give them back the American dream. Nobody else offered.

0,"Had the violent outcome been in the other direction, if a progressive activist had killed a white nationalist for instance, would the behavior of the progressive activist serve to illustrate the depravity of the progressive mindset and all associated progressive causes? We're constantly reminded that such reductionist generalizations are inappropriate where certain kinds of terrorist acts are concerned. We really need to be philosophically consistent in making these judgments. I think the white nationalist movement is a misguided reaction to circumstances that are more accurately addressed in the context of growing economic inequality and underlying class warfare. Poor whites in the U.S. likely have much more in common with poor blacks and Hispanics than many want to admit. But the economic (including MSM) elites don't want these issues addressed in such a fashion and I believe racial division and conflict unfortunately serve as convenient diversions.

I agree, but when anyone of us (anyone of us) goes to Jesus with true sorrow in their hearts for sinning (Sacrament of Confession), God who is merciful and loves all of us so much, will plant a seed in our hearts and souls that will inspire change/transformation in us, so that we are truly saddened when we sin against/offend God or our brothers and sisters. He will plant this seed in our consciences! It will start to become more and more impossible to offend God and not become sick to our stomachs until we have gone to Jesus and our brothers and sisters begging their forgiveness! I guarantee you that Jesus will always accept our apology, even when our brothers or sisters do not! Lastly, let us remember that """"act of (perfect) contrition"""" is only an act. God sees through our acs and our hearts. If our motivation does not meet what is needed Continued

It's because they are largely shut out of the diocesan media - as is anyone who is not one of the above 1.5%. Diocesan media often claim to be independent, but most of them are tightly controlled by the local hierarchy and/or stacked with Opus Dei members. A theologian once wrote a scholarly piece about Reconciliation for a diocesan newspaper. When it was published, however, it was so heavily censored and reworded that it looked like a parody of what he had originally submitted for publication. He threatened to sue the paper for defamation.  A diocesan paper experimented with a """"letters to the editor"""" section, but dropped it after 2 weeks because letters similar to comments on NCR started flooding in.  Deny the mass of the people a voice, and they eventually revolt, like in 1776.

He could have reminded all Catholics what the purpose of our sexuality is, its proper place and its limits.  The full and higher purpose...which goes far beyond the mutual gratification of our spouse...could have become the more topic.  That he didn't, tells me he really either doesn't know this teaching or far more likely that he's not interested in being faithful to Catholic teaching.  He's kept the concept of sexuality at the secular level, leaving out its supernatural meaning and purpose.

No such progress is seen in Saudi Arabia.  So why would Donald Trump double down on support for Saudi Arabia and crank up the anti-Iran rhetoric?  Rouhani should be encouraged, not demonized.  Now is the time for the west to reach out to Iran and seek to influence its institutions in positive ways, not give them the back of the hand.

Those who work in manufacturing might be involved in statistical process control which uses algebra and other mathematical methods.  Engineers of course couldn't even begin their work without advanced math.  Advanced math opens many doors into today's technical world, and I don't think we want to leave the young facing closed doors.  Literature is also valuable both in terms of improving writing and communication skills and in exposing the young to diverse ways of thinking.  On the other hand, the loss of actual classes in shop and other practical work oriented subjects is unfortunate.  I haven't seen a list of electives currently given in the local high schools but I am afraid that I would find an infestation of PC courses designed to indoctrinate the young to certain ways of thinking.

0,"The American voters elected Donald Trump as President, on the basis of his campaign promises, one of which was for tax reform.   So, Ryan doesn't have to """"sell"""" tax reform to the voters.  Or, to their representatives in Congress, who purport to carry out the wishes of the voters.   Trump's campaign promises are, largely, the same promises that have been made by the GOP  Establishment for the past eight years.  But, while the GOP has been great, with promises, their track record of carrying out their promises has been abysmal.  The GOP has the Presidency, and majorities in both Houses of Congress.  Ryan doesn't have to """"sell"""" anything.  He simply has to bring the promises to a vote.

Taking a lesson from the Netherlands might be useful for Canada, too."""" ------------ First of all, health care is a politically charged topic in the Netherlands. It took them over a decade to reach a policy consensus on reform of their health insurance market to a managed competitive market.  And the outcome? The Netherlands witnessed a dramatic increase in health care costs and significantly climbed up the GDP/health expenditure ladder to #2 behind the U.S. While the Dutch system remains a high performer, the net result of the reforms to date has not been efficiency, it has been rising costs.  Carol Propper does not lend her argument credibility with that last unsubstantiated claim.

0,"The article fails to explain the fact that dispute resolution under Chapter 19 is not really an independent review.  The panel's mandate is very limited to determine if the US or Canada are following faithfully the terms of their domestic trade remedy laws.  This is a strange idea that a country is deliberately fudging on its on trade remedy laws. Also the domestic trade remedy rulings prevail as the panels are not binding.  This is a far cry from what Simon Reismon lead negotiatot or Alan Gotlieb, Canadian Ambassador to the US wanted.  I remember Reismon was bitterly disappointed in the end and said the negotiations had failed as Chapter 19 was only a paper tiger. Softwood lumber attacks against Canada  have not lessened because of Canada winning panel decisions from this weak Chapter 19 review.  There are more important NAFTA issues that should take priority, including """"Buy America"""" protectionism where many Canadian jobs are at risk. Chapter 19 is not a hill to die on in my opinion.

0,"Lonergan's insights regarding secular & religious conversions and authenticity & sustained authenticity can have pneumatological implications. But the late Jesuit, Don Gelpi, criticized transcendentalist accounts of thematic grace as too """"a prioristic"""" and posited grace, rather, as transmuted experience. This positions claims of any putative pneumatological inclusivism on more empirical grounds. His pragmatic account remains optimistic, anthropologically, but it's a """"chastized"""" optimism.  Gelpi's account of graced transformation remains consistent w/a religious pluralism, evaluating doctrines per how well (can differ in degree) they foster Lonergan's conversions. In my view, all of the great traditions & many indigenous religions share an essential ortho-doxic soteriological trajectory in thus fostering authenticity. They otherwise foster any sustained authenticity via diverse poly-doxic sophiological trajectories or ways of being-in-love w/aspects of God, others, cosmos & even self.

0,"Dear Colkoch,  Do Catholics/Christians need a compelling case for the legal concept of full personhood at conception?  In Jeremiah 1:5, God said, """"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you"""". All human life - including that of the unborn is sacred in God's eyes and must not be wantonly destroyed. When the Blessed Mother was pregnant with Jesus, Holy Scripture tells us in Matthew 1:23, """"Behold the Virgin shall be with child, and bear a son."""" Jesus Himself began His earthly human life as a tiny embryo. In Holy Scripture Jacob and Esau are called """"children"""" while they are in the womb. It is improper and I have no doubt hurts God terribly to use language when speaking about a child that has been conceived as """"a clump of cells"""" or """"tissues"""" or """"tumors"""". But we can see why - Imagine talking about abortion honestly and actually admitting that it is a """"baby"""",""""child"""", """" human life created by God"""" that we are aborting?

Many of these seminarians do not even get ordained and they don't pay all that money back when they don't, and some become priests only for a year or so and pay no money back.

I agree that this is destructive, even unjustifiable, but it is understandable, comprehensible.

0,"Yes.  But you can also do the same with your hand, and a regular stock on the gun, so why does it matter?  I can fire a semi-auto weapon (pistol or rifle) at 100% the same speed with a standard stock, as you can with a bump fire stock installed.  It only takes a couple of hours to master the technique, which just requires you hold your weapon differently than normal (so it is awkward at first).  Does that mean my finger will be illegal and I'll need to license it with the government or they will take it away?  And Feinstein's law is completely stupid.  Technically, cleaning and oiling your weapon will make it cycle faster (marginally), so will gun oil be illegal?  A smooth trigger can improve it, so will there be a minimum mandated trigger pull and stroke? What about piston vs gas driven AR's, since cycle rate can be different there?  Buffer weight? Spring strength?  Suppressed?  All these can increase cycle rate, so all could be regulated under Feinstein's bill!

0,"This suggestion of an imperialist Russia is a figment and bait to lure people into supporting NATO and USA imperialism and aggression. Russia has shown no inclination towards expanding, and has not initiated conflict with any of its neighbours. Crimeans had sought to rejoin Russia for over 25 years, ever since their high-turnout January 1991 referendum saw them vote 94.6% in favour to leave Ukraine and become an autonomous republic of the USSR - but then the USSR dissolved, and Crimeans reluctantly settled for an autonomous region inside of Ukraine (low voter turnout, bare majority support). The matter of Crimea returning to Russia was polled constantly since 1991, and every pollster, including the UN, always found large majority support among Crimeans for returning to Russia. And post 2014-referendum, all polls similarly show 85% + support for the outcome of the referendum. There is no question that returning to Russia was the genuine democratic will of the Crimean people.

If you find this hard to believe, you are an ignorant fool and should read the Economist, NYT, Foreign Affairs other than pieces written by Nathan, the ideologue.  Canadian exports to China represents less than 5% of China's total import, and that number is decreasing.

Even Gov Walker who by almost any measure has been quite liberal in his policies since taking office was squarely behind tax credits to bring in smaller oil field players to diversify the oil patch. And it worked as a number of the recent discoveries have come from just these players.

For all the blather about how the Dems have failed the white working class, it was the GOP that had both houses for the last six years and did nothing, absolutely nothing.  I actually feel bad for those who voted with 'bald faced stupidity' because they will certainly reap the consequences of that stupidity.  Trump will turn on them because even his blinded ego is beginning to process the fact he is not liked at all by over half the country.

0,"I would not call the Eastern Orthodox faith a rigid faith. In fact, a lot of the recent scholarship on orders for women in the early church was done by Orthodox scholars, many of them women, and resulted in the restoration of the diaconate for women. This is lightning speed compared to the RC's. Are you Orthodox? I am. I fully accept that we are shrinking in parts of the world but I've read quite a bit on this subject and things look healthier in some places than in others. Russia, for example, is said to be bleeding members but that isn't entirely true and once you get out of the big cities, things look pretty vibrant. We also have quite a few converts. Orthodoxy is a faith many are attracted to because it doesn't have a 900-pound catechism and observes a long tradition of mysticism. By the way, if you are quoting the Pew study, it had a very small representation of Orthodox compared to the total number of participants. Small enough to introduce error.

The easiest reading of the text suggests the Apostles are present in all events mentioned. Particularly the breaking of the bread.

Housing prices there have risen at a 15.1% annualized rate from December 2014 forward, in large part due to the two overnight rate reductions by the Bank starting in January 2015.

There is no mention of inattention or texting in the original charge against Franco, nor did she admit to it where it mattered, in a court of law.  However, one thing she did not challenge was the presence of marijuana and alprazolam in her blood, both, like it or not, illegal to ingest without a prescription.  Furthermore, her acceptance into a residential drug treatment program after twelve month's imprisonment is consistent with the original charge.  She was not ordered to refrain from texting on her cellphone.

0,"Maybe McCain has come to his senses.  Republicans have argued for 7 years that Obamacare was a partisan bill passed only because of special deals for reluctant legislators.  They used these arguments to create citizen anger against the legislation.  Now Republicans are doing the exact same thing.  Only Republicans are voting for this bill.  It  includes special rules for Alaska and Montana.  It takes money from the states that expanded Medicaid and gives it to the states that didn't (those states would have had that money except for their governors and state legislators).  The Democrats have used these same arguments as the Republicans did to create citizen  anger against the Republican legislation.  It seems that McCain sees what most Republicans don't wish to see - that the Republicans are doing the same with healthcare legislation that the Democrats did with the same results.

On the other hand, Mabuza needs a woman presidential candidate, if he wants to be a deputy president. This will favour Dlamini-Zuma. He could however opt for the chairmanship of the party. This scenario will favour Zweli Mkhize who could in turn opt for Baleka Mbete as his deputy.

In the case of the Malheur occupiers, they were heavily armed, and if I remember correctly, Ammon Bundy said (for publication) that he believed the occupation couldn't succeed without its being armed. That heavy armament was at least, an implicit threat to use lethal gunfire against authorities attempting to remove the occupiers.  My fear is that this will inspire """"copycat"""" public land usurpers to arm themselves equally heavily, and that sooner or later, that behavior will result in a lot of death and mayhem.

0,"Here's a big problem with vouchers that airlines provide as compensation.  A number of years ago, I came back from an overseas business trip, connecting through LAX. United offered compensation for volunteers on an overbooked flight. I stepped forward when the compensation included $1000 voucher.  Turns out the voucher was only good for routes United flew directly and is used to be discounted off their full carriage fares and you have to book through their call in center. In other words, when it came time for me to use the voucher, a simple trip from where I live in Canada to the place I normally go to in States priced at $800 on Expedia, on United at the call in center was priced at $1800 before taxes.  In other words, it was cheaper to book my flight on Expedia than on United at their call in center in order to use the voucher.  Never again will I offer my seat on a flight for a lousy voucher that is virtually worthless. Lesson learned.

0,"No no no no no you don't my dear.    I did not like your writing in this part.  You said:  The progressive income tax based on federal tax liability would apply to people in higher income levels and exempt or minimize the impact on those in lower income levels. The income tax would capture income earned in Alaska by non-residents, and state income taxes can be a deductible item for someone filing a federal income tax return.  You talk of fairness and then you talk of exempting people.  Sorry my dear but a fair tax is not making some pay and others exempt.  how do you call that fair?  This is the reason I never ever agreed with liberal or democratic concepts, you make some pay and exempt everyone else.

Why admit more people into America when we don't have enough jobs for our own people ? We need to put America first . Why are democrats allowing certain cities to look the other way towards illegals--protecting them rather than throwing these law breakers out ? Trump is the only one saying we need to help  the inner cities . When he in sympathy to those living there said they were living in hell , democrats claimed he was knocking them when what he said was clearly meant as helping them because he understood how bad their living conditions were. He wants to bring jobs back and lower taxes for everyone. Hillary wants to raise them ,which will cause even more companies to leave America.  Every Trump plan puts America and American's first . Hillary offers the same losing idea's of Obama . She will destroy America .

Islamic proselytization is forbidden in Japan, it is very difficult to import Qur'ans into the country, and there are very few mosques. In Japan, Muslim men are expected to pray at home, not in mosques or in the middle of the street as they do in France. Islamic organizations are not allowed, so the Japanese do not have to deal with the incessant stream of propaganda coming from pro-jihadi groups like CAIR. There is only one imam in Tokyo, a city of over 13 million people.  Virtually the only Muslims who are in Japan come as employees of foreign companies. And even that is the exception rather than the rule.

This is at least part of the reason that we have so many not using public transportation.

Furthermore, the longliners export half their tottal catch to Asia right off the bat. The other half comes to Hawai'i with half of that exported to the mainland.  The longliners will make up the 5% with fish from international waters where the longliners are catching 95% of their fish already. The longliners are on a quota system, which limits their catch of bug-eye tuna. Exports, quotasand, the fact that tuna are being overfished are the limiting factors here - not expanding Papahanaumokuakea.

The problem is no child chooses who their parents are or what socio-economic class that they are born into.  Fluoridation helps those less fortunate.  Seniors, who retire, often lose their dental insurance, and 7 out of 10 most commonly prescribed medications for seniors cause dry mouth.  Lose one's saliva and the cavity rate skyrockets.  Fluoridation helps seniors.  Want a plumbing problem fixed, one calls a plumber.  Want an electrical problem fixed, one calls an electrician.

If the passenger continues to be unruly the Flight  Attendants notify the pilot and ground crew and then they can chose to remove them from the flight. The unruly passenger gets grounded, gets a lecture by the airline ticket agents or security and if the passenger has seen the error of his ways gets booked on the next flight.
