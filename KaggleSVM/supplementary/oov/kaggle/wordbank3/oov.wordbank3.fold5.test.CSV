Throw in the 20% of white voters who love to pat themselves on the back for supporting illegals and he is untouchable.

0,"Trump never said all Mexicans are rapists.  http://www.breitbart.com/live/vice-presidential-debate-fact-check-livewire/fact-check-donald-trump-not-call-mexicans-rapists-criminals/  Trump did not say anything against gay marriage.  In fact, he did say he """"is fine with it.""""   He has said *nothing* opposing gays or lesbians.  He said the gay marriage issue is """"settled,"""" meaning he does not oppose it.  Trump said TG people should """"use whatever bathroom they want."""" (source:  NYT)  Trump never said """"Black people are moochers.""""  You don't even have your facts straight on what Trump has said.    Not even close.   So I  find it even more hard to believe you have powers to read other voter's minds.

0,"Hanabusa is pulling an """"Ed Case"""" on Ige.  Watch, Andria Tupola is going to win.  Young, full of energy and new ideas, understands how to use social media, and does not have a lot of political baggage.  Hanabusa, who just got into Congress, is NOT going to be able to beat Andria even if she beats Ige in the primary.  People are just sick of old recycled politicians.  Especially one that just got re-elected back into Congress after she left trying to get to the senate.  It's pretty clear she wants to run just for the office.  She doesn't really care about the people of Hawaii.  That theme alone is dragging her campaign.  Ige, on the other hand, is just boring.  The biggest issue is that Ige and Hanabusa are going to cannibalize themselves by fighting over the same pool of Japanese American voters.

0,"There is probably some truth with what you are saying.  Wynne has already come out in public support of the LCBO staff rather than the management, which is somewhat odd.  However, one might suspect she is merely courting the most amount of votes at this moment.
"
0,"Actually, since you asked, gays were not even considered legitimate minority, much less a class until Focus on the Family and Colorado for Family Values made them one.  By crafting a constitutional amendment (#2) in 1991, specifically making gays a legitimate subset, they unwittingly accomplished the exact opposite of what they were intending.  The Supreme Court noted that they had made a class out of gays and had targeted that class for discrimination.  I guess, just like this baker did.
"
0,"There was no increase in prices following the election, therefore we can conclude that a 20% tax on imports from Mexico will not result in a price increase in products from Mexico.  There has been no loss of labor in the agriculture sector in the US, so we can conclude there will be no loss of labor when the labor force is deported, so no risk of increased prices as a result.  This all so obvious and logical, it hardly needs be said.

National parks will probably be sold off as well, that has been on the agenda for years too.

0,"Well, they create employment for lots of folks, sort of like the tax laws. I would suppose that that is one of the main reasons for them.

0,"She needs to go. Horrible leader. As for the remaining Liberals, they need to be voted out of office including Trudeau who is putting Canadians deep into debt and opening our borders to problems that are currently ruining Europe. Also, the implementation of M 103 is the Liberals attempt to shove their virtue signally down our throats. The US Democrats acted in a similar fashion and look how the masses voted. Free speech needs to maintained.

0,"Divide and conquer. The answer to a less-than-perfect government (you think perfection exists in the corporate world? you do know the greatest car companies have had major issues with recalls, unsafe cars, etc? why hold government to impossibly high standards of perfection as an excuse to destroy critical services such as education?) isn't pessimism and """"Tea Party-style logic."""" I'm as mad as you, especially about some of Kitz's major snafus, but I'm not anti-government. Let's make sure it doesn't happen again, yes, but let's not make matters worse by becoming anti-tax.

0,"Well, Mr. Minshall, you are just one man. Are you saying then that all Jews committed war crimes then? Did I say you committed war crimes or did I say our nation committed war crimes?  In 1948, Israel was attacked. How you think otherwise is beyond all logic. Then you talked about Semitic people living in Israel since the dawn of time. You know well as I do that it is not ethnic differences that is creating the havoc today but religious difference. Palestinian Jews and Arabs are divided by faith, not race. So it really don't matter who was there first. But we do know that the Jewish nation has been there far longer then a Islamic state.....actually that part of the world never been a state of any kind once the Jewish kingdom was destroyed by the Roman Empire....until 1948. Then the Arabs decided to  exterminated it and failed. Because they failed, you are whining over the petty notations.

0,"The problem with these carbon taxes is that they hurt the lower class. The lower classes are the only ones who will be forced to change their behavior by these taxes. For those who are well-off, an increase of 10 cents/litre at the pump isn't going to kill them. Or, an increase on their hydro or natural gas bill is a mild annoyance. What about costs of airline flights? That will go up too- travel by air is one of the worst carbon emitters. Expect your flights to cost more.  No more holidays in the Caribbean for the average Joe and Jane. . The well-off will continue on in their lifestyle because they can afford the carbon """"price"""", while the lower class is pushed lower.

0,"Stan Not all people are liars, no matter their race. As a class, many Politicians are liars, and those in the Zuma faction, not only lie, they use tax payer's money to pay British white colonial spin-doctors to invent new lies for them. The South African black population probably has a similar proprtion of liars and rogues to other race groups. The problem is that many of these liars and rogues appear to end up in the ANC. And yes, the business people that are complicit in these dodgy dealings with politicians are also rogues and also belong in jail.  If black people really will always vote ANC, which I doubt (the municipal elections proved otherwise) then I feel sorry for them, as they are voting for a life of penury and state dependency.

Likely whatever the evidence, most Trump supporters will not care that American democracy was undermined by a foreign power since all they care about is that their """"team"""" won. They live in a separate reality and no amount of evidence or facts will change that. But at the very least, it should lead to greater protections against foreign interference in elections in the future.

It is a truism of U.S. politics that anyone who donates big bucks to anyone’s campaign for office can get an audience with the officeholder. That’s how the system works and every single politician rolls with it because not to do so would needlessly offend donors, whose help may well be needed in future campaigns. There’s absolutely no violation of ethics laws when an officeholder meets with someone who has contributed directly to that officeholder’s political campaigns.  Lots of entities, foreign and domestic, donated lots of money to the Clinton Foundation, before, during, and after Clinton’s time as Secretary of State.  Clinton Foundation, which is not an officeholder of any kind, but a 401(c)(3) charitable entity.

0,"What would you be saying if it was mandatory that all blacks were kicked off campus for a day, organized or not?  Racism is racism.   Affirmative action is an insult to both blacks and whites.  it unjustly promotes on group above another.  It gives the impression that blacks only get prize because of the color of their skin.  I acknowledge what was the motivation behind it.  As far as decent, I will dispute that. I take it you supported the Black Liberation Army?   After all, there had to be payback for the years of slavery, correct?   Never mind the fact that they were sold into slavery by fellow Africans.   Never mind that there were black slave owners.   It is all about race, correct?  If you want to see racism, look in the mirror.
"
0,"I know this will be contrary to most opinions here, but I believe the U.S. 10th circuit court of appeals erred. The man nor the facts of the pervious incident years ago were never heard nor tried to ascertain their validity, and thus an improper inference was drawn from a unsustainable, never tried or proven past event, as to be considered as fact in a case years later presented today. Because of this, it was a credulity  being offered as evidence of guilt, that should not even been allowed at trial, since the past event years ago and the facts of that event were never tried, nor fully proven in a court of law as to their truthfulness.  Men are tried on facts known of the case at hand, not """"suspicions"""" of an event years ago that somehow replace facts on the charge at hand in drawing inference of guilt on the charge at hand. Even a previous arrest or conviction for such in the past would be questionable as inference to guilt in the trial on a same similar charge presented years later.

0,"I supported Gabbard in the last election.  I went to hear her speak when she was in the area near my home.  I will not support her in the upcoming election.  I find she is the worst kind of grandstander.  She made a big show of stepping down from the DNC to support Sanders.  Now that he has lost, she continues to support him.  After witnessing some of her choices I am no longer convinced she is a progressive, nor is she a Democrat ( large or small d)  She is fighting a battle against super delegates during an election which will create more division in a party that desperately needs to win in November.  She might have a point.  Talk about it after the election.  Her coziness with Sheldon Adelson is just mind numbing.  He has been in bed with all of the leading Republicans and now he is in bed with Tulsi. Her bill against online gambling was a sweet gesture to keep her buddy Adelson raking in the dough.  I was pleased to see that Maui's Shay Chan Hodges is running against her.

If it can ever get a music scene going it will be unstoppable. .

No, but at least he's doing something, which dipper central in Burnaby isn't.

0,"Are you sure about that? Under the NDP, a lot of groups will keep what matters to them as the NDP put Albertans first.  - Public service workers will want to keep their jobs instead of losing them with conservative cutbacks. - Businesses and people working on infrastructure projects will want to stay in business and employed. - Families with kids will want secular education instead of conservative value version. - People who need health care will opt to stay with public health care versus privatization, user pay scenarios. - Post-secondary students and millennials will want a proactive government that believes in climate change and is helping to transition the economy from oil-based to diversified.  The NDP have been trimming old conservative big spending patterns but yes, they need to do more. They need to trim out a layer or two of management in health care and education. They still have 2 years for this mandate. We need to hear everything they found and changes made.

0,"I remember those debates in the  90s.  I volunteered for Inner City Outings, building programs for under privileged inner city youth.  The state was cutting back on  hunting and fishing licenses in favor of saving salmon, steelhead, deer, elk populations. the sales from guns, bows, fishing gear made up for residents not having to pay for the national land or discovery passes.  This money was promised to be used to keep green spaces green.  That market depreciated.  Hunters and fishermen have been under attack since, the responsible ones report to fish and game, take care of lands, understand need for habitats.  Considering our city parks today, the idea is the same habitat parks matter. Who, how to afford and get ahead of deteriorated lands? The question...low income families, fixed income workers is a fantastic question.  Investing in protective factors for our under privileged peeps is important. Why did the city council vote 5-2 against expansions of parks? High rent housing crisis.

0,"Second, while Finnish taxes may be higher than American taxes overall, it is not true that Finland spends more on education per capita than the U.S. Per capital education spending is roughly comparable, and I think that the U.S. actually spends a few tenths of a percent more than Finland. It's rather how the money is spent. As many other commenters on this article have mentioned, the U.S. taxpayers pour billions of dollars each year into the coffers of educational corporations. In contrast, Finland spends much less money on standardized testing and curricula and related to it. Indeed, one major point of Sahlberg's book, Finnish Lessons 2.0, is the wasteful spending that has taken place in America through the corporate education reform movement which has taken education out of the hands of teachers and placed it in the hands of politicians, textbook companies, etc.

The fact is, Gardner dropped charges to make the protesters and their point go away. Press charges and we revisit his votes to strip away access to health care for tens of millions of Americans.  We can go single payer or fix the ACA. (That's ObamaCare, in case you're not sure.) But destroying the individual insurance market, which serves entrepreneurs, gig employees and others who are of growing importance to the American economy, is not conservative -- it's just destructive to all our interests.  And when your employer-sponsored health care is canceled because you've been laid off in a """"downsizing,"""" you would advocate that that's just tough luck, right?

No, because their social structures are set up around group identities (e.g., the Dutch tried to add 'other' to unions / sports teams / collectivities that were already organized around 'Catholic' or 'Protestant').  In large areas in Canada, we've been quite successful in integrating immigrant groups.  The Danforth is no longer a Greek ghetto, just a place with a bunch of restaurants.  Heck, there used to be places in Port Arthur where you could only hear Finnish; now, they're having trouble even keeping the restaurant open.  People come here knowing that they can add Canadian identity to their other identities, not be forced to discard their previous sense of who they are.  Your discomfort at seeing someone wearing these things, or at hearing only Chinese in Richmond or Surrey, doesn't constitute enough reason to invoke force by the state to _make_ people integrate.

The government does not own the PFD. They have the general fund that historically have emptied. they will empty the PFD too. IF the PFD is taken to be used for government use, I'll do the math: that equals taking the mineral rights from us property owners, all the royalties, and invested earnings as well. That is outright theft of property and income. Governor Walker (republican wearing independant clothes) is enforcing this theft by making the legislation change the law to do so. This is called legalized crime. This should be impeachable.

0,"The answer lies in abolishing all the previous crime legislation brought forward by the previous conservative regime, and restoring our justice system to the progressive, effective system it once was. Unfortunately, the current Liberal government seems uninterested in reversing these laws, and seem content to wait for the courts to strike them down.....eventually.  The liberals need to create a justice system that focuses on rehabilitation, rather than incarceration. That means making it easier for offenders to get pardons, get parole and get jobs once they return to the community. If an offender is released from prison, but can't get a job, or a place to live, or community support, what is the only option for them- RE-OFFEND! The status quo only makes our society less safe.

Look, houses in Vancouver cost dozens of times the average annual local income before the tax, and they still cost dozens of times the average annual local income after the tax. What this illustrates is that the foreigner tax ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING towards bringing house prices back to affordability for local workers.

0,"My daughter has been at EWS for 3 years and it has been a really positive experience.  While limiting screen time is encouraged, I know there are families with screen policies across the spectrum at EWS. Some families have no screen time at all while others go see movies regularly and have iPads for their kids. Parents are trusted to make the best decisions they can for their families. My daughter uses black crayons at home (because sometimes you just need to draw a black cat or a spider!) and reads chapter books (she's 8 years old). She has celebrated Rosh Hashanah before because a couple students in her class are Jewish and the parents wanted to bring in latkes for everyone, and it's really a very multicultural and tolerant place where all the world's faith traditions are learned about. In my experience it is very forward-thinking in that regard. Our daughter is happy there and learning lots—intellectually, socially, physically. It's a good place :)

0,"Well, Mr. Paget-Brown is a buffoon if he or anyone else left safety standards up to anyone except for the competent authorities.  The question is could they not afford sprinklers or chose not to spend the money.  It would appear there were funds available, so it doesn't sound like a cost saving measure. It sounds more like incompetence.  You bring up savings £30M in 2013/14.  That should be applauded.  That money, then is available for some other purpose.  I am not sure I agree with refunding piddly amounts like £100.  Heck, the money was already collected, may as well keep it and reduce taxes next year.  But I don't think returning £30M  impacted whether sprinklers were installed or not.  It seems like there were funds in reserve that could have been used for that purpose.  It seems someone made a decision not to install the sprinklers.  Why was this case.  Unfortunately, incompetence knows no political boundaries and equally infects Cons and Libs.

You do what the boss wants within the law or else you're fired. In government, there is the Opposition, bureaucrats and other stakeholders.  Donald Trump seems genuinely puzzled that his executive orders can be blocked or overturned. This shows his lack of inexperience in how government actually works.  Trump also foolishly attacks the judiciary system. Judges may be independent but they also read the newspapers and watch TV. Annoyed judges will likely rule against Trump if he keeps attacking them.  Then there his tweets and comments about Muslims. There is talk about subpoenaing Trump and his associates to find out if his Immigration ban is really about keeping Muslims out. We might see Ivanka Trump and Steve Bannon being forced to testify as to what Trump said on what day.

Like Trump, he takes everything that comes to him for granted, with no concern for anything but his own self-interest.

0,"It's not just the prison budget that creates the problem. When the wage earner is charged and put in jail, the family has a very hard time even feeding themselves, much less paying for rent and utilities. That generally puts the entire family on a welfare program that includes some medical and food stamps. That cost should be added into the prison budget cost. It'll give the state a better picture of what the real impact is, of using prisons to house/punish victim less crimes. There is a heck of a ripple effect when a person is jailed. Then the fact is that cases can't get solved in our judicial system. There isn't enough attorneys available to take cases with out often having conflicts of interest. The calendar dates just keep getting pushed ahead for another month, until the prisoner just confesses to something, right or wrong. What a fair and just system we have.

Deficit is three times larger, and it will not be eliminated in 2019 as promised.  They have also changed the metric from surplus/deficit to Debt to GDP, because they have no intent of ever balancing the budget.  Don't be fooled again - taxes have one direction to go, and there are only 350,000 1%'ers to punish, so the middle class will feel the pain sooner or later.

And, as I posted before on this page, I exempted amatuer and pro athletes and was specific about high schoolers and below.  I include college players with amateurs. These athletes are mature and responsible for themselves. And by that time they should have knowledge from their JH and HS sports on how to train right. When they play college, Olympics, or pro they are, or should be, making an informed, competent, and personal decision to play in a money market that they will have a choice on how competetively they want to train to earn a spot. When you play at this level you are making a mature choice to accept whatever training the team requires. Those levels have a right and a need to be competetive, unlike HS.

He could not write what he did and have it published as a white man who was interested in the history of indigenous people.  The fact that he does not clarify how his connection justifies his claim is worrisome as one would assume that by now he would have done the research.  This is problematic as surely he does not think or hold the belief that his status will be accepted without some documentation and he has mentioned to date many tribes, surely he cannot belong to all of them.  I also question his caring about indigenous people given his treatment of the people he named in his Giller Prize Winner Black Spruce where he does not acknowledge his sources, names people without permission, and to this I say, if he were truly indigenous he would ot treat his own people the way he does.

For a very small money for some dramatic injuries, which is sad.  Quebec is similar.  The rest of Canada, well, good luck!!

If we attack the Russians with conventional arms near their border, they will and should (on proper reading of modern Americans who will no sacrifice significantly for anything) escalate to nukes.  So we send 200,000 troops to Latvia.  The Russkies take out New York with a 5 megaton warhead.  They dare us to retaliate which would lead to massive nukes from Russia wiping out the USA as we know it.  It would solve the global warming problem.  Decades ago, the Russkies did not know if we would commit suicide by retaliation.  Now they know that America has no heart for self-destruction.  Bottom line:  We can never fight Russia or China.

And the reason for that is that Williams is not a leader but a blamer. He want the title of Commissioner of Correction without the responsibility. It is a reflection of some of the supervisors we have in DOC Alaska. He wrote a dishonest report, he threw the rank and file under the bus and now he wants their trust and loyalty?? I know that pot is legal now so he must have been smoking that hallucinogenic plant pretty heavily. Well, we got an another death at ACC so it seem. But this one should be laid directly at the commissioner's feet since he is the captain of the Great Ship DOC Alaska.....and all injuries and deaths of inmates and staff, rest at his feet.

The Rafale is only marginally better than what we are currently flying and is not compatible with any of our existing weapons.  Both jets are more expensive.  This is why no Euro other than the builders have bought any.  The Gripen fails to meet many of the RCAF's requirements.

The church is willing to spend millions in donations on protracted legal maneuvers to keep secret evidence of their knowledge of pedophile clergy and their response to victims.  Wonder why?  It takes a special kind of attorney to deal with the constant dirty tricks and never ending stonewalling of the church.

Otherwise, why """"laicize"""" any priest if they can function as one again? (The Roman system is a class system, laity on the bottom rung, and worst thing is to reduce a cleric to lay state!) Of course, there is mythology of """"once a priest, always a priest"""" Canon Law notwithstanding.

0,"Society's empathy is burned away when news media hypes propaganda against others, such as Assad, Russia, Putin, whoever... because forcing determinations on people causes their consideration to fail, and their minds to polarize and become filled with prejudice and negative consideration value which needs to be filled with something. And so it becomes filled with whatever is the easiest and most gratifying target for a person. As the G&M hyped unsubstantiated assertions against Russia for the previous year, with all the allegations having progressively proven to have been false, the G&M was polarizing people's perceptions against others, and short-circuiting people's ability to consider matters truthfully. The G&M was creating prejudice in people, and now that frustrating emotional prejudice needs a target to be able to express itself towards. Racism is the product of prejudice, and prejudice is the immediate result of making a determination. MSM has been cultivating prejudice for years

Working in a facility for unassisted seniors, one of the tasks was a concierge service in obtaining taxis for our residents. In ten years I never had one pleasant experience in performing this task. Each and every time I experienced rude dispatchers a horrendous wait time, and unpleasant drivers. Most of the time the phone wasn't even answered when called and would take calling through and entire list of taxis to maybe find one that could show up. The wait time was never under 30 minutes. Most are the worst drivers anyone can see by driving in Eugene. The Lyft and Uber services are organized and efficient. The apps are extremely user friendly.Rates are very reasonable.

It's not a secret that liberal secular Muslims are ostracized from their communities if they choose to embrace their faith without submitting to strict rules of prayer and modesty. The issue is not a one off, it is part of a wider discussion about accommodating a culture that supports segregation - the laissez-faire approach pushed by smug """"progressives"""" has failed conclusively in Europe so why should Canada toe the same line?

People are expected to choose careers when they're only 17-21, but are not sufficiently informed because potential employers have no incentive to guide them given the never-ending flow of immigrants.  Our youth have been sacrificed by miopic immigration policy.

Timeliness is also a key factor which the RG should in many instances improve upon, with your important internet audience across Lane County and beyond. A small anecdotal example of this is the non-coverage of the recent passage of a solid new Lane County Emergency Powers ordinance, and then of the Board's declaration of an emergency due to the damage and hazards from the ice storm.

Arguments abound trying to use the millenia of human history with TWO 'accepted' genders as evidence of the validity of the gender dyad as apoditic fact. I...disagree.  For 99% of history, men have been defined as the biologically superior gender, and as such, men have taken charge of everything involving intellectual/creative effort, based on  whatever primitive 'science' early civilizations managed millenia ago.  Women have spent most of history cramped in a few, forced social roles based on the same facile 'biology' of aeons ago - subjugation through lack of control over their own actions, restricted opportunities, and rights more appropriate for their historical status as men's possessions/breeding sows. The fight for women's education allowed our gender the context to really SEE their inequality - and the reasoning skills  to slay the flaws that underpin sexist beliefs.

The threshold for reasonable and probable grounds is bad enough, let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt when a case reaches our courts.  The lay person has no idea how this process works, nor can they appreciate the complexities associated with such investigations.  A drunken frat party where sex between two persons occurs does not automatically equate to sexual assault.  The investigator has to be able to absolutely confirm that the sex was without consent.  What is further lost in all of this is the """"subject"""" of such complaints.  They have rights too.  If accused of such a crime, the investigator better be damn sure a sexual assault occurred, if in fact that person's police record shows them as committing that crime, whether charged or not.

Very rarely have these articles shown any hard statistical data to support the claims of national long-term worsening weather/damage trends. To be clear, citing singular events in single communities/regions does not make a national trend. Also when some damage costs are stated, they are rarely compared to previous years in fixed dollar terms.  If the MSM is going to continue publishing these types of articles, can they please include long-term statistics and graphs clearly showing this trend of worsening weather and resulting increase in damage on a national scale.

0,"""""Layoff 200 more teachers.."""" Shame upon the Alaska State Senate majority.  Voting down the House`s school tax HB115 without even vetting it or allowing any amendments from the minority. The conflicted and corrupted Senate majority.  They have to keep those subsidies flowing to those three international corporations controlling access to, and competition for our resources and their benefit and value. They are so quick to throw education public safety and infrastructure in the gutter to pay fealty to, and cover losses for, and assume risk for, the slope cartel and it`s proxies, above our constitutional obligations as citizens.

0,"Trump is a candidate that embodies the reckless half-truths that have been the mainstay of AM talk radio for many years. Like Limbaugh et al, Trump merely echoed this same message: Obama is a Kenyan/Muslim, climate change is a hoax, tax cuts for billionaires create jobs, illegal immigrants are all criminals, Muslims are predisposed to terrorism, etc. The more Trump echoed these sentiments, the more votes he received.  The reason why Republicans were unable to stop Trump is that they, by and large, agree with these positions. But I have faith that a coalition of progressives, union workers, women, young voters, college-educated whites, and minorities will accomplish what conservatives were unable to do.

My dad passed away in March of 2016, well before he passed, as POA I assisted him in creating an online account to change his address (from that of his apartment to my home address for mailing, his actual residence was in a nursing home).  Our accountant submitted dad's paper income tax forms which the CRA had mailed to us with his old address on, well after I submitted the address change online.  The online change we made reverted back to his old address.  I tried to change it again using their PDF form and faxed it twice more - receiving snail mail reject form letters with no explanation as to why they rejected the change request. My final attempt involved having the exectors of dad's will, me as POA sign letters, send his death certificate again, the form, a picture of his headstone and a picture of him in his casket.  That was 6 months ago now, no response whether the address change was accepted

Youth unemployment has always been higher, this is due to the fact most jobs require certain skill sets and even if open, if one doesn't have them they won't get the job.  You gain experience by working in a job not just education so perhaps more Co-Op programs at higher educational institutions and perhaps even tax incentives to hire younger workers.  The reason most companies are reluctant to hire younger workers is if you cannot get a reference from a past employer you are taking a gamble whereas those 30 and up you can get a reference from a past employer which can help decide if they are suitable or not.

Holding a pro-life view doesn't translate into forcing the committee to subscribe to her views. If anything she would likely to be even more carefull considering the controversy , to make sure she walked a neutral line.

Yet not *one* *single* Catholic bishop or (AFAIK) priest spoke *one* *single* word of  criticism of Donald Trump, during the entire campaign.  The Catholic clergy had their priorities: (1) maintain the status quo lip service about how much they care about those adorable, precious-wescious, all-important fetuses and (2) keep the female away from the position of prestige and authority.  Now they've noticed their priorities might mean their pews (and baskets) will be somewhat emptier and they're crying.

In terms of energy-exchange, there's little percentage in a 100-lb snake climbing, and balancing itself for long periods, in a tree when arboreal prey is generally smaller than that it can find on the ground. (2) Pythons specialize in proportionately LARGE prey, enabling them to feed infrequently.  They're ambush predators.  I've seen a ball python fast for over a year. (3) Most snakes--including pythons--usually seek out burrows rather than superstructure.  I once crawled beneath a friend's house to remove his 10 ft. reticulate python that had become lodged in his plumbing. (4) Being albino suggests basking in the sun wasn't an option. (5) In a region utterly lacking native snakes, probability of a second snake leaving a sloughed skin approaches zero. (6) The snake did travel some--at least as far as the neighbor's trailer and back.  Probably not much further.

In short, each of my employees previously got approximately $6,000 a year in an accrued account to use to defer healthcare costs.  They could use it to reimburse direct expenses or insurance premiums.  Congress left HRAs intact when they passed the ACA but the IRS and HHS interpreted stand-alone HRAs as non-compliant health plans and ruled they had to be discontinued.  As a small employer I had no statutory obligation to do anything for my employees, but our firm was required to abandon our HRA benefit. My thirty something secretary and her truck driver husband and their three young healthy children just found out the premium for their insurance will be $2500 a month in 2017.

Obama care did not include a public or cooperative option. We're told it couldnt get thru Congress, but I suspect a bit more lobbying of the 218 congress reps who eventually voted in favor might have helped.

0,"Since Fr. Martin was mentioned in this piece as a parishioner of St. Ignatius Loyola and since he has a piece about building bridges with the gay community which should start with not firing gay employees, I think it bears mentioning that St. Ignatius' former musician, the very talented Kent Tritle, felt the need to leave St. Ignatius as soon as New York state legalized gay civil marriage. He had been with his partner for many years and naturally wanted to take advantage of the 1138 rights and privileges that come with civil marriage. That meant, of course, leaving St. Ignatius for fear of being fired for causing """"scandal."""" Thankfully, Kent landed on his feet in a much better place: the great Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, which welcomed him and his husband with open arms. There he felt no fear of being fired simply for being married. He alluded to this in a New York Times interview back in 2011 though never came right out and said so, for obvious reasons. St. Iggy's loss.

0,"Seems like a long list of misleading examples.  For example a business owner with $80,000 income will not be able to split that with a non-working spouse to achieve a lower tax rate.  However, a salary earner with $80,000 income would not be able to split that income with a non-working spouse in any case.  Why should the business owner pay tax at a lower rate than the salary earner? Similarly the writer sheds crocodile tears over the fact that some of the bank account interest on business savings might be taxed. How much could that be these days?  On the other hand if the business owner is fortunate enough to earn large profits through passive investments on the stock market, that amounts to a large amount of extra RRSP room.  Why should that be an exclusive entitlement of business owners? High income earners who incorporate have had a good ride for many years.  It's high time that they started paying tax at the same rate as the rest of us who are not corporations.

Now here's the kicker, food for thought, most people don't realize because the arctic is soooo far away from where most people inhabit, the ocean currents that keep England and the East Coast relatively warm despite their latitude, are driven by this exchange of heat between the equator and poles. Same things goes for monsoons and other weather patterns driven by these ocean and air currents that deliver seasonal rains. As the arctic warms, these currents around which much of the earth's populations depend, are going to change, and probably not for the better. I'd have to say as a species, we have our priorities all f*cked up. This isn't the future, it's the here and now.

0,"So what if HiLIARy received 1 million more votes.  Trump received the most popular votes in 30 states.  Your flawed mob rule logic would elect a president based on the fact that one state, aka California cast one million more votes favoring HiLIARy.  California is NOT a true reflection of what the rest of the nation wants.  It's no secret Progressive Democratic Socialists want mob rule.  Since slavery is no longer an issue and everyone, regardless of race or gender can vote, your point is no longer relevant.  Mob rule is what you have in Washington State which is controlled by a small number of counties.  Trump won 30 out of 39 counties.  Mob rule was considered by our Founding Fathers and quickly rejected.  On a national scale a mob rule system would be controlled by a small number of states and would no longer represent the nation as a whole.  Your party lost and now you want to gerrymander the election process to tip the scales in your favor.

Since the Swedish empire was defeated by the Russians some 200 years ago, Sweden have enjoyed a time of peace. After we held a neutral stance in WWII, we also developed economically, due to our industries and our workforce being intact.

As people become more educated (in critical thought), the more they have the ability to see the nudging around them, and when they see nudging they generally feel alienated from the nudgers (government, society, the elites, etc.), and react against it.  Who likes to be tricked?  So where does that leave us?  Nudging works the opposite of the way you want it to when the architecture of choice is perceptible.  So, it's not enough that architects of choice simply believe that they're smarter than the people (which they undoubtedly do), they need to actually be smarter than the people, or risk undermining their own projects.

Most of the time I couldn't get through to a dispatcher at our two cab companies. If I did get through, there was a long wait for the cab to arrive, and sometimes the cab didn't show up at all.  The cab companies want to limit supply in order to keep prices high.  I hope the state legislature changes the law to allow Uber and Lyft to operate in Alaska. It would be especially beneficial in some of our smaller communities, that don't have any taxi service at all, and give locals a chance to make a little extra money.

I was never convinced that the chemical event some years back was perpetrated by Assad.  With Obama's red line or whatever it was regarding the use of chemical weapons, their use would likely bring the US into direct conflict with Assad, who at the time was not doing well.  Assad knew this.  Since chemical weapons do not offer a significant advantage over high explosive except in limited situations, why on earth would Assad have used the chemical weapons?  The killer rebels, on the other hand, desperately wanted US intervention.  The killer rebs  apparently hold life in minimal regard.  I doubt that the Syrians care whether they are killed by high explosive or chemicals.  I wouldn't.  So, for the life of me, I cannot see a rational motivation for Assad to use CW.

Fact: The US could most easily arrive at a system comparable to the best and most effective in the world with modifications to ObamaCare. Fact: Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare would be a grave mistake. Fact: The plans proposed by the republican congress had about a 17% approval rating with the public. Fact: The republican congress is too politically motivated to take a reasonable path towards solution. Fact: Faith in free market solutions are a risk to health and humanity.

Private interest do not belong on public lands for profit. Ranch leases have been the same for decades, a net fiscal loss to the government and causing the bulk of the destruction to the range land. Does is really make sense to remove horses from the range to place them into costly holding pens while allowing ranchers to over run the range basically for free, while making a profit for their use? I would say no, that this makes zero fiscal sense. Ranchers cry poor me and twist the arms of the officials to remove the horses so they can continue their way of life, in spite of the fact that their living comes at the cost of the range lands and the American people. Just because the range historically served private interest, does not mean with the population growth that this can or should continue.

Now to phase-in e-verify and at the end of that go after what remains along with sanctuary gov, and we will have a good start on immigration issues.

0,"Seems this article was more about what people are doing with their lives than a real examination of the problem of overpriced housing in a market that is becoming ever more like San Francisco. And common people are being pushed out, and expected to commute to serve the increasingly wealthy residents of the core metropolitan Seattle environment.  It would have been more interesting, to me at least, to read the causation and why and wherefore that is creating an escalating value, bloated and overpriced as it is, in Seattle.  It would be nice to have also seen the impact on the whole of the urban landscape this overvaluation of property in the city is having on residents within.  This piece only grazed on the whole subject, and so is really more fluff and lacking real substance to truly attempt an understanding the impetus, the driving factors behind the destruction of the diversity that was Seattle.

0,"We do have that freedom of choice. It just isn't paid for with taxpayer money. I can never understand this argument. No one is stopping you from offering your child an alternative or religious education. They're just asking that you pay for it. Common sense shows that we can barely afford public education for all as it is, we don't have the money to fund both public and private education. Part of the reason Alaska's education costs are so high is trying to run so many small schools spread out all over. Spreading out the $$ spent in all regions would only exacerbate this problem. Also, most of the people who support vouchers are also the ones complaining about the money spent on education right now. Vouchers would increase that amount by expecting the same amount of public buildings be open while sending their funding to private schools as well. As far as religious education, are you okay with your tax dollars paying for a Jewish or Muslim education for others?

Such things like the refusal to conduct a church funeral for gay married members juxtaposed with the church's inadequate responses to the pedophilia crisis)...all this contributes to the institution losing face in the minds and hearts of members.

No politician can return the jobs of  the """"good old days"""". The working class fell for the siren song of Tea Party Republicans who have done nothing to address their plight, nor will they since their funding sources are wealthy contributors who drove and benefited from the same cost-reducing changes in company behaviors that led to working class grievances.

Remember the goal of marriage isn't 'marriage' or sex..it's heroic love.  And the Church uses Jesus's own self-gift as the benchmark.  It doesn't use Eros.  Splitting the gift of marital intimacy isn't full self-gift.

0,"Notwithstanding their conflicts, confusion and misdirection, religions persist: the big questions in life, like origins, destinies, etc., cannot be answered by reason alone, but by faith, and the transfiguring sense of Eucharistic experience in life’s transformational trajectory. Reason coaxes faith in directions remembered in intuitional experience, and on grounds of experience, faith and reason try ever so laboriously to structure a creed of conscience, by which to direct life toward actions and understandings that fulfill and endure. In search of purpose and destiny, faith and reason are in perpetual dialog with better intuitions wanting to further common well-being, but are troubled by mortal conflicts of self-interest passion. Troubled as it is, the Faith of our Fathers lives on still in quest of the Godlike sense of Faith/ Hope/ Love; as in the past, however, self-interest passions yet conflict with the Godly Eucharistic sense of common well-being.

Investment  will go elsewhere in the world if tax regimes are not competitive.  The idea of increasing inheritance tax for example is anthema to the way an entrepreneur would view it  as a successful  entrepreneur would  want to leave the most of the benefits of their hard work to their descendants. Trying to stimulate entrepreneurship by identifying potential entrepreneurs is difficult. I'd suggest that it would be better to provide an environment that is very  supportive of  entrepreneurs  and they will thrive on their own.   The state's prime objective should be to provide an environment that enables all people to thrive, especially the poor, and lift THEMSELVES  out of poverty. You cannot make people thrive. State subsidy of education, housing, transport, services, medical etc  can provide this.  Individual handouts will not.

Of course, as world trade shows this is a mirage.

0,"That this doesn't conform to your worldview does not mean I'm quibbling. The Eastern Rites are dynamically different both now and then. The Order of Mass differed from place to place. While they all had the same four parts, they were ordered differently. Some rites and usages contained prayers that were not used in other places. The Kiss of Peace was after the Creed in some places, while it dropped out of use elsewhere. Some utilized more litanies, which are foreign to the Roman Rite. (The litanies used in the Roman Rite are taken from other rites, such as the Gallican.  Yes, the Roman Rite developed over time.) At one time, Rome itself had at least four different ways of celebrating the liturgy depending on where the liturgy was celebrated and who was presiding. There were also differences in the calendars. While they were all God-centered (reverence being subjective) there were differences, which means the Mass was not celebrated the same way everywhere. That's simply a fact.

Yes, there are some youth members supporting Kenney (and there are youth quotas for every constituency), but those coming out to vote skew definitely into an older demographic, not representative of Alberta's population. So Kenney wins nomination with his ground game, but as leader of a far-right party, he will be a hard sell in the new Alberta.

This in turn, thrust pharmaceuticals into the dog-eat-dog marketplace ruled by merchants.  Throughout history, including the time of Jesus Christ, healers were more assuredly poor and reliant upon the charity of society...by their choice.  They hardly expected a Mercedes chariot, palatial Kahala residence, royal influence, or even plumber's wages.  That is, not until they rebranded as Western healers.

0,"Thank you for writing this piece and putting out the facts in context.  Much appreciated.  While the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is the current """"thorn in our paw"""" over public lands my hope is that folks understand that it is just a small, but painful element of a much larger plan to wrest away our public lands to allow exploitation.  That it is being done with lies about our US Constitution and our Founding Fathers is appalling and should anger all of us.  If the militias and protesters are so anxious to deal with """"tyrants"""" and those destroying the promise of America they have only to look at the forces bent on stealing our lands for exploitation and buying our political system.  Thanks again for arguing for lawfulness and reminding citizens that our public lands legacy is on the line.

0,"Thanks @scottd for the Macleans link. About a year or so back they also did a very good expose on the Vancouver market.  I think the GTA market is being driven more so by local speculation that what we saw in Vancouver.   The 15% Vancouver tax may have given the Toronto market a push,  but there were lots of lessons to be had from the west coast in terms of speculation, profiteering, and   flipping.  Houses here are still more expensive than in Toronto, and anyone not buying in at a million soon had the spectre of 1.5 million looming in front of them.Then two million.  People who sat on the sidelines here forever lost their chance at owning a house.  And they now have a rental vacancy rate of well under one percent to deal with, on top of escalating rents.  Those Vancouver lessons are no doubt also driving the GTA market.

There is no mention of a compensating reduction in taxes. The private sector will make hefty return at the expense of the taxpayers who will line the pockets of the so called investors. Perhaps if Selfie Boy and his cronies were to stop throwing away hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars to each and every global, politically correct, delusional, image seeking, socialist inspired cause that enriches the lives of everyone but Canadians, then may be we would have some money to fund these same projects without having to pay twice.

0,"Sir John A. MacDonald is celebrated for founding Canada. We have not erected statues in his likeness or named schools for him because of what he did to the First Nations. Columbus is celebrated for his discovery of North America and not for the genocide it provoked.  Confederate """"heroes"""" are an altogether different story. The only thing that they are famous for is fighting a war to maintain a brutal system of slavery. Putting up a statue of a Confederate general is by extension celebrating that system of slavery and racism.  Personally I see a clearcut distinction between these two types of monuments and it is obvious to me which ones should be taken down and which should stand.  At the same time, it is always important to better inform the public of past injustices. Plaques that provide a more accurate history of the depicted individual would be good. Better history education in schools would be best.

When the individual mandate was eliminated, well...  As to the wisdom of the individual mandate, see how well it works in Massachusettes and how much profit is made by these same insurance companies in that market.  Let's face it: As long as SOMEONE has to ensure those with pre-existing conditions. then the companies will always pull away and claim losses, especially if ONLY sick people buy health insurance. The Repubs will leave these people to the whims of the states (many of which are Republican themselves) and these people will suffer as they did before 2010.

As for your """"I don't believe Jesus could err,"""" etc., right, given the faith in Jesus such as the Christian church professes, so that allowing that the Jesus of faith could err would be a kind of contradiction in terms. By contrast, the historical Jesus most certainly could err, and seems to have done so on at least one important matter, viz. the apocalyptic timetable. And it is that fallible Jesus who provided the data from which a small number of first-century Christians constructed their respective portraits, without themselves necessarily understanding all the implications of their work. And we should note that the Holy Spirit did not demand uniformity, but allowed for such limited understanding to be the seed of much subsequent fruitful discourse.

Minimum wage was conceived as an entry level wage, designed to teach young people the difference between french fries and boogers, how to act professional in the workplace and to teach them rudimentary skills upon which to grow and become more valuable in the workplace. And while it is obvious many minimum wage workers are not high school students, it's not the employers responsibility or obligation to help solve poor choices made by others. They certainly CAN, but it's not their obligation. McDonald's didn't impregnate your girlfriend and has no responsibility towards that.

Thus, leaving no money to spend other than what is needed to live on (no rec money) and a bleak savings scenario for retirement.

Or just be made aware because, you know, they're the FBI and they should just be in the loop? In any case it's apparently not the law that Trump Jr. Should have divulged anything and the only reason he is now is because of this overblown predilection that the Russians stole the election out from under Clinton's dirty feet. I find it remarkable the lengths that the msm and the Democrats are going to stretch this """"we lost because of the Russians"""" theory.

The authors also ignore the long term obligations Alaska has for PERS/TRS as well as the need to fund capital budgets needed for Alaska to have basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges and airports.  We need to grow the Permanent Fund.  What the Senate did last year was ensure the fund will be destroyed- as their scheme to raid the fund allowed for no inflation proofing.  That means it is just a matter of time before there is no Permanent Fund.  The creators of the Permanent Fund named it the """"Permanent"""" fund for a reason.  The fund was not established to be raided to allow the theft of Alaska's oil.

So, even though that was hard, it was much, much different than it was for my significantly younger brothers who had just entering their teens.

0,"Nothing to do with 20 years of previous investigations; just the four years of her being Secretary of State and having something quite valuable to sell.  The email scandal was a indication of a much larger crime, one the """"Justice"""" Department refused to prosecute.  If you were a prosecutor, would you take on the next POTUS?  Especially one as vindictive as Hillary Clinton?  I was in the military and used to run an organization dealing with communications and computer networks in a most highly classified environment.  The """"decades of investigations"""" argument has been overused and found invalid.  Just the """"Uranium One"""" scandal is so huge it could result in life sentences alone.  Bradley Manning was just one of many examples of what happens to people who screw around with classified communications. I love how the Clinton Foundation reporting has completely dried up now that they have nothing to sell.  The foundation itself is completely failing.

0,"Let's make a rule going forward.   If you cannot specify where we should cut and how much we should  cut, you can't advocate for cuts.    Simply demanding """"more cuts"""" adds nothing to the conversation and demanding that these undefined cuts take place before revenue measures can be imposed ignores the reality of our situation.    The House spent an entire session and came up with cuts of 1% in the operational budget, the Senate 2%.    Walker said cuts up to 16% would be necessary, but still submitted a budget which increased costs 2%.     So, if you are simply going to advocate for cuts alone, use the budget tool:  http://www.alaskabudget.com/spending and specify where and how much we should cut.    That at least provides a starting point for a real discussion.    I suspect you'll find that, realistically, we could only get to 5% per year in real cuts.   Budget cuts will be only a small part of the solution and must occur in tandem with revenue enhancement, not as a prerequisite.

You understand, right? THAT'S what the voters rejected. THAT'S why she lost. It wasn't love of Trump that did it. It wasn't that the Russians released emails that showed she hadn't just misspoken, but that this was really truly her attitude (that did help). It was that Hillary, knowing those emails were out in the public, insulted half the country and thought she could get away with it.

0,"I think we are confusing pedophiles who suffer from a mental disorder, with normal sexual  desire between adults, usually a man and a woman. According to the dictionary   pedophiles suffer from a """"mental disorder"""" involving a desire by an adult, usually a man,, for prepubescent children, quite often boys. What I was referring to was the repression of a natural, normal desire of a man for a woman, that finally lets loose inappropriately by celibate clergy with one or more  members of the congregation. So we both agree that there are no more pedophiles among clergy than among the general population. What I am saying is repressed celibate clergy tend more to sexual abuse due to repression among those as opposed to the general population. It is understandable that this would be covered up for obvious reasons but should not be. Clergy are human so is the Pope in fact. Asking for celibacy is inhuman because it is not normal and incredibly hard to do. Desire among adults should not be suppres

Frankly, I can see that word as less offensive than the term Indians which of course suggests that Native Americans are from the country of India, a clear falsehood.  But basically much ado about nothing.  P.S. The confederate statues do honor some people, but that honor is almost certainly for aspects of their lives that are different from the ones you might identify with.  You'd have to read some history to understand the loyalty of people to their states back then.  Many of the confederates were considered patriots relative to their states.  At the time, many believed that the states ultimately had a right to self-determination.  It is not clear whether or not Lincoln committed war crimes by brushing the south's right of self-determination aside and enslaving them to the north's wishes.

Therefore, the majority, that supposedly didn't agree with me was only 29%+1 of the entire voting population in the state.  Let that sink in...29%  So the """"majority"""" I may be in on this issue represent a whopping 71% of the electorate of the state of Hawaii. You might feel that 29% is enough to justify change.

My issue is that like Ronald Reagan who made us more comfortable with our prejudices, Trump's victory gives full throated endorsement to the darkest corners of white culture and ideology:  meetings of white supremacists groups celebrating Trump's victory with cries of  """"seig heil""""; Trump has chosen a white supremacist as attorney general - the very person who supposedly defends our constitutional rights!

If he needs to stoke acts of hate, it is merely the cost of his being their great leader.  He will, no doubt, like every problem, solve this, too.  He is awesome, right? This is what makes Trump so dangerous.  His vast over-estimation of himself, and vast under-estimation of the damage he is doing, in achieving, and maintaining, his presidency. Can he be reigned in, before the damn breaks?  So far, it looks very unlikely. America has always loved crisis, real or imagined.  No wonder so many see little to be concerned about, it is, in many ways, just banal American crisis mode.

But there is also the custom of not speaking ill of those who have just died, so a simple statement recognizing the significance of the moment while not passing judgment on the man is proper. There will be plenty of time for history's judgment later.  There was a time when the death of Castro would have been seen as a watershed event. The U.S. government even tried to hasten it from time to time without success. But at this point, it really isn't all that relevant, politically speaking.

At the same time the ICJ, also known as the World Court, rejected Bosnia’s request for payment of reparations from Serbia, successor to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) of the 1990s, for the worst massacre in Europe since World War II. The judgment, which is binding and not open to appeal, called on Serbia to transfer Ratko Mladic and others indicted for genocide to the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), a separate judicial body with a mandate to try individuals.

0,"In my opinion, Trump recognized that the Republican health plan was not better than Obamacare.  Yet, the Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare.  Eventually, Trump told the Republican leadership to put up and pass the legislation or shut up and move on.  I believe he did that to kill the repeal process.  I believe he effectively killed the Obamacare repeal with full knowledge and intention.  All the democratic progressives should be thanking Trump for saving Obamacare.  Because despite Republican majorities in both houses, Trump managed to derail the relatively poorly crafted health care bill.  Funny that the progressive media does not give him credit for saving Obamacare.  For obvious reasons, Trump cannot openly say he killed the Republican bill.  But he did.  The ACA continues through the sole action of President Trump.

There is a status called """"two man"""" inmates where you need two officers to escort an inmate out of his cell, with full restraint. Such inmates are considered that dangerous and they make up the bulk of the solitary segregation population. One of the more ironic element of solitary segregation is that some inmates would misbehave in the manner because they want solitary segregation. As weird as that sound, we do have inmates who preferred their single cell privacy and wishes to be left alone. We do have segregation in the mental health ward since some inmates may be too unstable to be with others. Then we have inmates in solitary because such individual may be too young or they need protection from other inmates. (I had one guy who owed gambling debts in almost every housing unit!!)

How does any Anglican congregation know whether a male priest is validly ordained or not. Some years down the line meticulous searches into a priest's ordination pedigree will be necessary in order to distinguish him from being a layman. For your information, as someone who was around at the time, there was no demand whatsoever from Catholics in the pew for any council or any change. The demand came from modernist theologians and who were accommodated by the Pope of the day. Much the same is going on today.

0,"I gave pretty strong evidence that liberal democracy survived in spite off, not because of, apartheid. Supporting apartheid actually very nearly destroyed it. Even today modern Russia is desperate to discredit the liberal democratic world order to make Putin's dictatorship look better. A key piece of their propaganda has been that the support of the west for apartheid proves that the west did not care about freedom either. So not only was supporting apartheid not needed to defend democracy - it actively undermined democracy and still does to this day. And you are basically saying the purpose of these articles is to be propaganda for the ANC government... To argue something nobody cares about, which the ANC would gain no benefit from arguing. All by an author with no known ties to the ANC. You've gone full conspiracy theory level off the deep end now.  Hint: propaganda focuses on  stuff that will influence voters. If this mattered then the ANC would have lost the election in 1999.

(And anyway, who created logic and its rules in the first place?)  René Descartes recognised this problem and insisted that an omnipotent god must be allowed to create with “absolute freedom.”  Like it or not, that means that an omnipotent god must be able to create logical absurdities such as square circles, married bachelors, dead life and so forth.  If you insist on omnipotence (and/or any of the other assumed infinite attributes with which gods are commonly credited), you cannot also insist on logical coherence, and vice versa.  That’s one of the sticky central dilemmas of god-belief.  What’s more, it limits what can reasonably said of any such proposed deity.

0,"""""While watching a legislative hearing on TV last Monday, I heard a representative of BP tell legislators that any change in oil taxes would """"discourage new companies from exploring for oil"""" in Alaska. This from a company that has done only one new exploration — Mukluk — on the North Slope for more than 40 years. Immediately after the Prudhoe discovery in the late 1960s, then BP CEO John Brown, said the discovery of oil on the North Slope would be treated by his company as a """"development"""" project.

Yes, the PM has a huge influence (eg:  in the case of Harper is was virtually a Govt of One) but every MP has a vote and a say (technically).  Khadr received an apology on behalf of the Canadian Govt and it's the Canadian Govt (not one person) that messed up here (repeatedly).     So I see no need for any personal apology from any of the PM's involved.   If they want to make an apology personally and privately face to face - that's their business - but no need to do it officially.

The pendulum has started to swing, the other way now.  The homeless criminals, have attracted other criminals.  Soon, there will be an umbrella organization, to bring a little control to the criminals.

One of them is that the politicians get off their duffs in Ottawa and meet people. Another is that ordinary Canadians can get to meet our leaders. The cost is not that onerous since the $1,500 price tag comes with a tax deduction.  If Trudeau ever comes to my neighbourhood I will scape up the $1,500 and go meet him in person. Or maybe meet the finance minister.

0,"In fact, there is no gold standard double blind scientific study showing fluoridation actually helps dental health (preventing dental caries). Even local studies show fluoridation in specific age groups of school age children doesn't work. There are many studies showing harm, however. Another point to consider regarding public health is that chlorinating drinking water is treating the water (which is a great idea if you live a few miles downstream of some city that dumps its sewage in the river upstream from your drinking water source). Fluoridating that same water treats YOU and that's medicating you (any chemical used to prevent a disease - dental caries - is a medicine) without your permission. We are fine with you choosing to use any medication you or your medical provider think appropriate - and that choice will likely be pharmaceutical grade whereas the stuff they've been putting in our water here is literally toxic waste containing many heavy metals - poisons in unknown amounts.

This is exceedingly rare and numerous studies have shown it's a non-problem, despite scattered high profile cases like the one in the article and another in Texas where an illegal immigrant (for some strange reason) voted for Trump. It's important that if this becomes law in red states there is sufficient oversight to prevent election officials from losing or disqualifying ballots from groups that typically vote Democrat.

As early as the 1910s, biologists enlisted the aid of salmon and halibut fishermen in their studies (i.e., consulting logbooks, asking them to note date and location when tagged fish turned up in their nets). Researchers such as C. H. Gilbert and W. F.

With Demokrats ruling completely from neighborhood to city/county to state, from legislative to judicial to executive branches, there are major problems like what we saw with rail. A pol in Hawaii is gonna jump from ride to ride - from county to state legis to national legis, back down to state exec, and back-n-forth. It is essentially the SAME people that we see recycled from office to another office. There is no way in heck that the state legis would NOT vote to pay for what a city screwed up. They are all the same people!!! And next election one of em will go from one to theother, and three of em will go from the other to the one. It's crazy! What REALLY shows the disfunction of Demokrats though, is the fact that EVEN WITH them all in state/city/national levels, and all of em in Legis/Exec/Judi bracnhes, that we STILL have all these loggerheads at getting anything done. THEY ALL THE SAME & STILL THEY FIGHT EACH OTHER such that noting get done right!

To prove a -reduction- in crime rates, increase in arrests, or decrease in access you can't just point to differences at a given point in time, you have to show both that, prior to the imposition of a given law, the pertinent rates were higher (lower) than after the law, -and- that if there was an extant decreasing trend, the particular law caused a statistically significant changed in the rate of that trend.  Similarly, to prove that registration works you have to show rates of compliance are statistically significant -and- that the registry has provided evidence that actually leads to (at least) an arrest.

Venting occurs at a number of points in the oil and gas development process around the world (well completion; well maintenance; pipeline maintenance; tank maintenance; etc.). During oil and gas development, huge quantities of gas may vent to the atmosphere.

The solids and fluids from the well go into pits, while the gases are allowed to escape into the atmosphere, or they are burned off.

In other words, are these tax breaks actually doing what they're supposed to do? A good example is within our own state. The company that owns Ala Moana Shopping Center is given a tax break in the form of an outright privilege not to pay the same taxes that other businesses in the state have to pay. These are the kind of questions that we must ask our government. I do not believe that this tax break is fair for local businesses and do not believe that taking away the tax break will result in the owners closing shop. If they did leave, there will be another conglomeration to take its place. You see, Ala Moana is a big money generator.

China and other foreign companies restrict US imports and place large tariffs on them as well.  In addition, China and Japan manipulate their currency in violation of international financial rules.

The US shale oil is a different, lighter grade than Canadian oil which tends toward heavy. Hence they are not in direct competition since refineries are configured to take prodominantly one or the other And cannot interchange their inputs at will.

It seems that even if the $1,000 an hour Beltway attorney signs a document filing an appeal, while the purported client ignores guidance from their own attorney who has expertise on Alaska Statutes and legislative procedures, the answer is NO, IT WAS NOT LEGALLY FILED.

Because they're Union, and especially in THIS city, it's difficult to fire these guys from the job. These guys could NOT work in the private sector for one month!

0,"Ray, I've respected your opinions for a long time. I know how you feel about term limits but was curious as to your views on whether a unicameral legislature (UL) would be more beneficial to the whole of Alaskans, compared to what we are stuck with now? Do you think it would be easier or harder for special interests to rule the roost if a UL were adopted? Do you think a UL would force the governor's office to work more closely with one body instead of two, and vice versa.  Wouldn't it make it easier for voters to get a constitutional amendment passed, when needed/warranted? Wouldn't one legislative representative instead of multiple per current districts be more accountable to their constituents and wouldn't the temptation to follow the path of least resistance, be harder to avoid? My own personal opinion is that 20 to 30 reps or a 40 max legislative body statewide is all the state needs in order to downsize and make these people work more productively . Thanks for your input!

0,"I've stated this previously, but it seems like time to repeat it.  I travel to Portland's VA Medical Center for medical care regularly at my expense (because the Anchorage VA Clinic is terrible in providing required services to women veterans). The vast majority of flights between ANC and PDX are jam-packed with slope workers coming to or leaving from work. I know this because I often speak with them in the boarding areas. Perhaps they buy a beer at the airport, but nothing else. Some of them absolutely hate Alaska.  These workers pay income tax on very high salaries earned in Alaska to Utah, Oregon, Oklahoma, Arizona, and other states. One told me that if he has to pay income tax to Alaska rather than to his home state, he will quit slope work.  It's true that the proposed Alaska income tax would generate revenue from some Alaskans. It's also true that it would generate considerable revenue from highly paid slope workers who live and pay in other states.

0,"I am in total agreement with your comments.  The Cdn Health Act has lead to system in which  the administration costs of two levels of government  bureaucracy devours a large percentage of the tax dollars destined for actual health care.  Our cost of healthcare per person  has become one of the most expensive in the world however it struggles to provide the most basic care to average Canadians with huge wait times for both diagnostic and treatment.  And yet if any politician dare suggest that that we need to look at reforming our failing system by allowing for a blend of private and public health care there is such an uproar that we even consider amending our sacrosanct system  that reasonable debate or discussion on reforming the Cdn. Health Act becomes impossible.

My commitment to these obligations I believe meets the definition of sacrifice, loving God and neighbor as myself, etc., essentially putting my faith into action rather than holding fast to a rigid ideology and making a religion out of that (i.e. trad C'ism). I don't know any progressives who don't think sacrifice is important, placed within its proper context.

Before Vancouver imposed their version of the foreign buyer tax, the realtor association says that foreigner purchases accounted for only 6% of all purchases. Then, why did the number of transactions plummet more than 50% after the tax was announced?

I prefer objective evaluations of skill sets, intelligence, and especially actual performance when I evaluate other people.  I don't even care what gender they claim as long as they are the best at whatever task they are performing.  Too many 'progressives' seem to have a problem with that.

0,"The airport being private, muni, state, ect has nothing to do with preventing someone stealing an aircraft. Muni gets out of the airport business and they actually will loose money. Every aircraft regestered within the muni is taxed annually between 150$ up to 1500$, airport fuel taxes, tie down parking fees, land leases fees for hangers, plus both federal and state funding to run the 5th busiest municipal airport in the world. Turning it private would not change the security, nor would it save the tax payer any money whatsoever as those federal and state fundings would still be applied and the muni would loose that aircraft registration tax. Not to mention that private airstrips for profit have landing fees, 3 times the cost for tie downs and leases, with literally no gurrentee of increased security.

I am old enough to remember those times - a day during harvest and the men came home in the evening totally worn out and tired. The physical work required back then would destroy any of our modern snow flakes in a matter of hours. In the meantime the ladies kept house and made sure there was food on the table.  Today you sit in an air conditioned combine cab guided by GPS and listen to music - back then a crew of a dozen or so farmers, neighbours and farm hands, older children ... would be out with the sun rise and work till dark to bring in the grain harvest - or starve later.

A tax cut that's paid for by taking healthcare from millions of Americans. That's not healthcare legislation, that's the opposite of healthcare legislation. Lisa is 'displeased'. She's just working her marks, refining her charade. Don't buy into Lisa's deceptions, she's already voted to move the Ryan budget.

The published summary of this study lists the so-called Cohen's d-value, which is a way of seeing how large an effect there is. For instance, while the wording of the article seems to hint that all ADHD cases had smaller sizes of the regions under study, the d-values tend to be between .1 and .2, which would make them, in research parlance, small to medium effect sizes. In other words, many children without ADHD will score below the average volume measure of the  ADHD kids, while many kids with ADHD will actually have volumes greater than those of the kids without ADHD. The mean value of the ADHD group tends to be lower than that of the non-ADHD group, but the data from this study shows that there are many other factors that will determine whether or not a child will develop ADHD.

Within an RSP, when withdrawn all monies are treated as income and subject to full tax.  Within an RSP you lose all tax benefits including the capital gains tax and the dividend tax credit.

0,"The Catholic church has highlighted the issue of abortion, focusing on the fetus and dissociating it from the woman whose physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual life becomes forever changed when knowingly, willingly and joyfully, or not, new life is conceived in her womb. There may be support from the father, family, ministers, doctors and friends, or not, but it is only the woman who experiences and endures the miracle and mystery of conception, gestation and delivery. Legislation concerning women’s reproductive rights is not about the promotion or prevention of abortion. It is about guaranteeing women’s access to correct information and proper attention before, during and after pregnancy. It is the Catholic church’s mission to guide women, and men, in the use and enforcement of federal legislation and regulations so that the life of the mother and the new life she bears are truly respected and nurtured.

After the assassination firearm experts tried to duplicate the time and accuracy, that was attributed to Oswald, and they couldn't do what he supposedly did. It should have been an easy task if what you believe is true, for them to duplicate the shots Oswald made. They couldn't. He didn't actually have a clear shot because of the trees in front of the Texas School Book Depository. When Kennedy was hit in the head with the fatal shot his head went back and to the left which is inconsistent with a shot from the back. There are many details that point away from Oswald and to others. Little things like Gerald Ford moving the position of the bullet in the back upwards so it would be more consistent with the """"Magic Bullet"""" theory. This he admitted in his biography.

When I talked to the airline people, however, since my wife wasn't on the outbound portion of the ticket, they automatically cancel the return portion. The solution was to change the departure of the existing return ticket which didn't cost much more to do than purchasing a one-way ticket.  Seems crazy, but YOU can't just buy a block of tickets and then decide who among your group uses them. The tickets are sold to specific people and they have to use them.

These faculty members are incredibly talented and committed but receive almost no support from college administration. They are contract workers who must re-apply every four months for a new contract. They make about $38,000 per year and have no job security what so ever.

One of the results will be that poor urban families will subsidize the Internet service provided to vacation properties of millionaires  in rural and remote areas.  The progressives are cheering the decision, but do they know that it will hurt the urban poor?

Hardly earth shaking considering the money given to lotteries at ridiculously huge odds.  Your thinking that Trump is blamed for everything. is as wrong as those who think he is guilty of everything that goes wrong.    The President continues with his childish tweeting insults and that does seem to be clearing the way for more posters to ignore all common standards for adult conversation.  That is NOT  Trumps fault, the conservative mass media machine has been promoting vulgarity and misinformation from the far right for decades now, far before Trump was a blip on anybodies political radar.    The same goes for the liberal far left.      Trump is a symptom, not a cause, of populist simplistic declarations made without evidence.  The trick - getting people to believe that everyone's opinion is of equal value - which is simple pandering for profit.

0,"There is a 97% scientific expert consensus on human-caused global warming. That consensus isn’t a result of groupthink, or a vast conspiracy, or money-grubbing scientists lying to get their greedy little hands on grant funds. In fact, scientists are very hard to convince of anything, and they’d much rather be the one to disprove a theory than the twenty-thousandth to reaffirm it.  Scientists base their conclusions on evidence and the evidence for human-caused global warming is overwhelming. Trump and his cabinet don’t consider climate change a threat, because they want you to think the question of human responsibility is still under debate. That's one of the reasons the Trump administration talks about “alternative facts.”  The interesting thing about scientific facts is they're right whether Trump agrees with them or not. They're not subject to his or any other climate deniers opinion. We'll see what alternative facts Trump tries to spin when Mar a Lago is under water.

In 2004 Keillor explained his own in his book 'HOMEGROWN DEMOCRAT'.  So, Froggy, for merciless anti-democrat satire, one should of course seek a DIFFERENT satirist, one with Republican or TeaPartyish views: ANOTHER droll writer, ideally as incisive & well-read as Keillor, but with a neo'conservative' outlook. Maybe a pro-Palin version of Calvin Trillin, a conservative satirist I recall from the 90s.  Lastly, the huge FOX 'New$' empire could recruit & publish satirists, IF only enough Fox fans really wanted to READ satirists.

To what extent does the Spirit allow us to correct the words of Jesus? Did Jesus literally expect the Kingdom to blaze out in glory in a few years (Mk 9:1), so that we are obliged to correct or at least drastically reinterpret his words? Theologically the embarrassment can be solved by distinguishing the limits of his human knowledge from the divine omniscience of the Logos.

At the same time I understand that to forget those sins is to run the risk of repeating them.  I do, however, fear that every time one of these films pops up it can easily refuel hatred toward the Church even though the Church has already repented for that particular transgression.  It's unfair to make a judgement about an age-old misdeed using the logic of the present context.

This paper has busily peddled the silly notion that COOLING and SLUMP has afflicted Vancouver, that MASSIVE COOLING of real estate there has resulted from the foreign buyer tax there implemented about half a year ago, inducing a SLUMP.  And you saw that silly narrative in headlines such as """"Toronto’s housing market may need a Vancouver-style cooling"""" and """"Toronto housing extends surge as Vancouver slump deepens"""" and """"Vancouver housing market extends slump"""" and """"Toronto leads rising housing prices as Vancouver market cools"""" and """"Vancouver house prices face double-digit correction: Royal LePage""""  Hello?

0,"""""The Boy Scouts aren't just allowing girls into their clubs, they're barring boys from having their own boys club, removing an essential aspect of boys' development, including emotional maturity, self-confidence, and self-awareness.""""  The major reason why Boy Scouts existed at all, if you bother to read your history, was not to teach young boys how to whittle or play mumbly peg with their knives or tie knots, it was to teach young boys on how to grow up to be good men, men who honored their parents and other adults, who understood the niceties of polite society, who were kind, and reverent, and who grew up knowing how to be a good citizen.  Why women would want to destroy this powerful tool for the growth and development of boys to men is completely beyond me.  This will indeed, in my view, be the death of Boy Scouts as an organization that stands for good citizenship and honorable service.  The demise of the Boy Scouts I knew and grew up with is already here, unfortunately.

So what makes a person without any formal training believe their own observations are more insightful than those offered by professionals? Sure, one can ask; """"why?"""" But there seems to be a perception that a group of professionals who have received degrees from accredited institutions, who follow AASHTO research and national standards, who read the latest discussions about emerging approaches to traffic management, who collaborate with a group of similarly trained individuals, who must (contrary to some recent events) renew their license  and who also drive the roads like us,  that they just don't have the needed skills to see the design problems that uneducated motorists?

Well, it's what citizens see. Seeing is believing. If these aren't typical, then homeless advocates should reason that different measures can and should be used in reacting to their overwhelming presence. No citizen should feel he risks his life merely in walking around his city. With the 3 stabbings in our fair city in a little over a week, the danger isn't arguable anymore: we are living in a very hostile and dangerous environment. Perhaps it's time for our new city leadership to convene some sort of panel. Additionally, any new chief of police should be selected on the basis of how she would address it.

He played to his base, but he hasn't stopped the GOP bleeding, including the full loss of Paul Ryan's assistance this morning.

I hope the money which in the past has been spent on homes (bishop's retirement) and unnecessary church remodeling can be diverted to the poor in the inner city.  A beautiful new renovated church is a wonderful place for prayer but the inner city parishes in Newark and Paterson with their old warn pews and smoke laden walls and their wanting soup kitchens are also a place for heartfelt prayer.  Bishop  Myers has neglected the needs of the poor...yes there are special collections, archdiocesan campaigns, parish food for the homeless and parish food pantries but the excesses seem to out weigh the need.

I thank you for that and might have said the same except I thought it might seem like special pleading coming from a Mainline guest here among you good , if contending, Roman Catholics.

His Holiness obviously thinks all Christians should get along, must get along as the People of God united by the Holy Spirit by Baptism. The Vatican radio website has the English trans. of the Papal homily, along with an interesting interview with the Dean of the Abbey.

Big money insurance is pulling both parties' strings.

See others that never had a chance to be free and are unlawfully imprisoned by the greedy fishing industry.  Better to close your eyes to the matters that plague the Harbors Division and ride you bicycle home heading to tranquil, peaceful Manoa.  Why would you save yourself and watch others that are imprisoned under state sanction?  You cannot expose your granddaughters to a pervious time.... impossible.  Speak to them of today.

0,"Why the Gratuitous Slag on Government Workers?  The author makes good points about the risks of a DB in a private company. But he shows bias with an unfair  slag on government workers suggesting their contributions to the pension (and presumably their entire salaries) come from tax dollars. That is basically true in form but not in substance. In substance a government worker contributes to the economy and the living standards of the country as does a private worker. The private workers must obviously pay for some of the benefits provided by the government workers and the government workers earn their salary and benefits if they are fair. If government salaries and benefits are too high (they often are) then reduce them but don't use a false suggestion that all value is created by the private sector as I think is implied by the comment about tax dollars.

The NPVIC tampers with a major tenet of our Constitution that is the framework around which our government is established. Therefore the moral and ethical thing to do is to lobby for a Constitutional amendment. However, NPVIC promoters object to this because it will take too long and likely fail. The NPVIC, on the other hand, requires less scrutiny, debate, and a much lower level of approval than a Constitutional amendment, and may consequently succeed. The change represented by the NPVIC requires the higher level of care in making the change to our method of electing our president. Anything less is subversive.

The same is true of the two examples you cite.  It is not correct to say that oysters and lobsters won't grow shells without adding alkali, nor is it correct to say the oceans have become """"acidic"""".  Increasing the alkalinity of the water has the same beneficial effect on shell growth as does fertilizer and increased CO2 on plant growth.  And the oceans remain stubbornly basic (ph above 7.0), despite the false claims otherwise.  Finally, it is totally presumptuous to assert that the present climate is the only one hospitable to our species.  Humans have been through ice ages and warm periods (warmer than now), and have adapted to both.  In general, warm is better, because it enhances agriculture.  Greenland got its name because it was once green.

And do you think for-profit makes it more vulnerable to fraud? Take the VA, please. At least in the private sector you can get rid of bad contractors. In the public sector, failure is job security. Insurance should be a calculated risk pool, and the minute you start subsidizing it you change that. You always get more of what you subsidize, always. And in the case of ACA, it more costs rather than more care for all. It should have been called the Medicaid Expansion Reallocation Act. That would have been honest.

Jobs that do not require a lot of skill level are low paid because anyone can do those jobs.  Jobs that require higher skill levels are more generously paid because fewer people can do those jobs.  This is why doctors, lawyers and other professionals are very handsomely paid, while floor cleaners, trash collectors, fast food workers, etc are not.

If you want the greener grass, then one should be prepared to make some sacrifices - specifically in the realm of assimilation.

The proposed program would provide money to families who are perfectly capable of looking after their children and it would separate children from families. In contrast the Guaranteed Annual Income would help only those who need help and would help children at home with their families.  The program would encourage raising children outside the home with its attendant problems when children are sick.  Finally any benefits from the program go to the families using the service with no return to the taxpayer who paid for the program.

We should be examining all of the possible alternatives for those women who find themselves in a position of having to consider abortion as a solution.  We should be joining with all other religions to make it an unprecedented faith-based movement to make abortion - if not prevented through the use of contraceptives we Catholics so foolishly hold on to as doctrine - unnecessary because of a huge range of services and support that are available to all.  We miss the boat here repeatedly, and then wail at how horrible it all is, when in fact it is we who are failing the unborn.

No mandate means we are back to having those those who choose not to buy insurance and then have, for example, a car accident, cancer, a premature baby, etc.  with no prayer of ever paying the astronomical costs of such events.  Do you really think hospitals will turn people with no coverage away? The cheapest way to health insurance for all is some kind of universal state-wide or regional coverage where EVERYONE pays something,  and costs can be brought down by the sheer power of numbers, as well as no more need to make a profit, as insurance companies must.  Every other industrialized, modern country has such a system at much less cost.

0,"To attain a population for a district, Geography is pre-eminent. County lines, municipal boundaries and compactness are supposed to be the guiding lines.  A state that has 1 million people should get 2 congressional seats. If it votes 60% or 600,000 votes for one party, that party in theory should get both seats. However, if most of the majority party live in the one major city, which constitutes one of the two seats, then the state will send one representative  from each party.  No matter what you do, you cannot draw that state in such a way that you do no """"pack"""" the urban voters together. A """"pie"""" split of the city will not satisfy the compactness requirement, or the municipal/county line requirement.

Look, DT won 86% of the 3,100+ US counties; HRC won 16% (down from 22% from Obama's second term).  The electoral college did what it was supposed to do, protect the majority from the minority.  If she really wanted to win she should have developed policies that appealed to more than just 16% of the counties.  I don't think anyone in the US wants to be governed by the population of Miami-Dade County, Lost Angeles County, etc.  She lost fair and square.

If it takes 3 plus hours out of your day to commute by transit, this can hardly be regarded as an alternative to driving.

This is completely opposed to what the ACA did, which was keep the virtual monopolies at the state level, which guaranteed exactly what is happening now.

Another reader has written the director, Carl Davis, to back his claim, which is great. In the meantime, you're right to point this out, which I did in the story: property taxes are regressive to the extent that they get passed to tenants.

It is well known since the cloning of Dolly the sheep that skin cells can be stimulated to produce a life.  It does not take sperm and a functioning ovum.  So many on this board who certainly are not scientists or doctors keep attributing to medical science things that are not defined nor known.

0,"Proper channels????  Justin fails to grasp that crossing into Canada where ever and by whatever means available is a proper channel for a refugee claimant. And it is part of our international commitment under the Convention Refugee treaties going back 65 years and is enshrined in our domestic immigration legislation.  There are a number of misconceptions about the refugee laws we have enshrined in our domestic legislation to implement our international obligations. One of the chief misconceptions is that such refugees are """"jumping the queue"""". They are not jumping the queue as there are separate queues for immigrants and refugees and even sub-queues for refugees.  Some refugees may appear at Ports of Entry and request protection while others enter Canada by simply crossing the border and then subsequently seek protection. They are allowed to do so under the IRPA and our international obligations.  See the SCOC Singh decsion in 1985 that led to claimants being accorded hearings.

0,"I was in the solar business in the 1980's.  We sold systems for about $5,000 with tax credits of 70% for a net investment of $1500 that saved about $140-180/yr off the utility bill, suggesting that was about a 10-12% return on net investment that would surely grow as the cost of energy grew.  We showed them charts of the fact that the cost of nat gas had been growing by about 10% per year since the early 70%, and projected that 30 years into the future.  What we didn't talk about was the fact that interest rates were quite high then, most folks financed the entire $5,000, and the interest expense was more than the utility savings.  What I wasn't aware of at the time was that FDR put price controls on nat gas back in the 30's, which led to a serous shortage of nat gas.  So, in the early 70's, Congress deregulated the price, and it became profitable to produce.  As more producers came on board, the supply caught up with demand, and the price of nat gas began to fall in 1983.

0,"Most of the points Ms Wente makes regarding illegal distribution and consumption prevail today under the illegal system. Bringing these practices in from the shadows, however, strikes me as entirely sensible. For example, her assertion that """"In Oregon, illegal marijuana still accounts for more than 35% of the market"""" could also be spun as an almost 65% reduction in the illegal market. Such practices will not be eradicated completely but, with the benefit of transparency provided by legalisation, can be reduced, monitored and controlled to a greater extent than they currently are. It is possible to be ambivalent and question some of the thinking behind the government's legalisation initiative yet still support the policy. There is much to criticise here but it seems to me that is true about most of this government's tenuous grasp when it comes to implementing complex policy. Be that as it may, when it comes to legalisation, we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

The pro-Trudeau camp are having a hard time reconciling this decision so they obfuscate with deflections about Trump or Harper Derangement Syndrome talking points because they are incapable of defending Trudeau. Trudeau is a champion of symbolic puffery, which is precisely why the Liberals are trying to limit his appearances in the House, because he is a weak parliamentarian and it's getting embarrassing for his caucus who cringe at the thought of being forced to defend an unscripted Trudeau thought cloud that makes no sense.  The fact is, this is a short-sighted decision that puts political symbolism above Canadian interests, this is clear to Trudeau supporters just as it is to the NDP and Conservatives. So deflect, obfuscate, go off on disjointed tangents, it doesn't change the fact this is a bad decision.

0,"Racism is the intersection of power and prejudice. The Spur Guy used the power derived from his race and his gender to intimidate the mother, what happened in the play area, although in dispute, is a straw man. What this guy did was clearly misogynistic and racist. It's not even up for debate.  I applaud the mother for standing up to him.  But in your zeal to be a racism apologist you have missed the point.  My point is that Spur have missed a branding opportunity while the right-wingers and racists are all playing victim and are no longer customers and therefore have no further influence. Businesses like Starbucks and Nandos do that - maybe Spur after redesigning its logo could have as well.

0,"As far as I know Jim Colver has never been a registered Democrat.  Is there proof of this affiliation?  Also, interestingly people do change their politics, especially as they age, own businesses and pay taxes.  You don't think Mr. Colver could become more conservative?  It is certainly too bad that he supported Mark Begich, and that is slightly recent, but his voting record in Juneau this last term is mostly conservative.  It is my understanding Mr. Colver dug in his heals on a couple very heated issues, one being HB 81 and the other an effort to remove funds from the PFD, which he opposed pretty vehemently. Being in the district that Mr. Colver represents, I responded to a survey last winter stating to him in writing that I did not want any taxes, or use of the PFD until a budget was established and spending was cut.  It sounds like he listens to constituents pretty well.  As a voter I don't see huge evidence of liberalism and I like a representative that stands their ground.

Mr. Trump's lack of a Nobel Peace Prize and his failure to get emotional for the kumbaya Paris Climate Accord has the AGW proponents in a tizzy. Trump  doesn't blame America and promotes the ideas, policies, and programs of Western civilization that lifted the World out of the Dark Ages and poverty.

From the writings of poets, playwrights, printed sermons, tracts,  and polemics (Foxe's Book of Martyrs) to the translations of the Bible in Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, and in the British Isles even before The KJV, vernacular was predominant.  Can you cite something for that 95 percent illiteracy claim?  You are right to suggest RC had little access to a vernacular Bible, but to ignore a very concerted ecclesiastical  effort to keep it out of lay hands is to rewrite history. It is not one or the other.

If he did that, I would hope that most of his sycophants would follow him into schism.  Then maybe the church could finally start to clean up some of the messes left by JPII the Great Enabler and Benedict.

Though it doesn't make sense (do you really want to claim that Dems made banks give away money?), I would assume that you are appealing to that mistaken belief that Democrats alone made Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lend to people with no money, therefore singlehandedly causing the 2008 crisis. But that's wrong, as any number of histories of the crisis, as well as the FCIC, will attest. The two FMs were late to the party, and trying to compete with private sector firms such as Countrywide. Wall Street pushed sub-prime and knowingly sold bonds full of junk with A ratings from ratings agencies that they themselves paid to pension funds. And deregulation - which started under Clinton and quickened under Bush - contributed greatly to the implosion. Finally, both Democratic and Republican presidents have pushed home ownership.

1,"These guys are proven liars.  Knowles always was a sell out to Big Oil.  As a GCI customer, I plan to boycott GCI.  Screw you, Ron Duncan.  If these guys really cared about the Alaska economy, they would not be arguing to steal $4,000 from each Alaska family of four.  The Alaska Senate refused to end corporate welfare for Big Oil.  The total amount of money that would be ripped out of the income of Alaskan families by a raid on the Dividend will about equal the annual corporate welfare payments to Big Oil.  But do these guys lobby to end the corporate welfare?  No.  they lobby to take money from Alaskan families.  Did these guys fight SB-21, or the giveaway of our oil?  No.  So with almost $10 billion dollars of oil being taken from Alaska per year, tax- free, they ignore that, and focus on a raid on the Dividend that will truly harm the Alaska economy.  Absolutely disgusting.

This makes the already asinine logic you apply in this case even more meaningless than it already was to begin with. Whatever drawbacks Hillary had as a candidate, those pale in comparison to Trump who is a dangerous demagogue who has inspired violent white supremacists to violence and has attempted to legitimize white supremacy and the disregard of democratic institutions.

Any additional cost to those who are 'just about managing' is painful. The damage has been done and it is a big political failure by the Ontario Liberals. The Progressive Conservatives are not offering an alternative better solution. They don't have to; all the Conservatives have to do is remind people how the Liberals are arrogant and indifferent to the plight of the working poor.

Had Khadr been convicted of these same crimes in Canada, he would have served the maximum penalty for young offenders, that would extended into adulthood. Should then the Canadian Charter of Rights should be extended to Khadr's Afghan victims, and Speer?  You know, victims rights and all that. It is as if the PM is testing to see what works to placate public opinion resoundingly not in his favour. Previously, it was make a settlement to save Canadians money, which was shot down as no Canadian court determined an appropriate settlement. This was an amount the Liberal government came up with on their own. He would not have received this settlement had these crimes happened in Canada. Trudeau sends an appallingly wrong message to Canadians committing crimes in foreign countries.

I also got a bit angry that I thought smoking was controling my behavior and not the other way around.    But that's just me.    I do know it felt like a moment of calm in the midst of boredom, sometimes pain and sometimes it's just totally mindless.   I also got tired of the cost.   I imagine everybody has their own reasons.   It's not a good habit, but I can understand it.  People know the risk and they still make the choice.  People ride without helmets, jump out of airplanes with/without parachutes, business men take adderall and live on caffeine. We can name hundreds of high risk behaviors, many of which might endanger the public.   How can a person who pays tax's to sustain the parks, then be denied access because of their particular habit?  Just saying.... I'm not endorsing smoking to anyone.

0,"Stimulative government spending aimed at jobs creation, an aspect of the economic theories of J.M. Keynes, worked, so long as they were applied, to end the Great Depression and worked to end every subsequent recession until the adoption of supply-side economics under Ronald Reagan. So your first sentence is a fantasy spread by Republican tax-cutters. Since Reagan, supply-side tax cuts have been used by every Republican president, and each time resulted in little to negative economic growth (as with Kansas) while significantly increasing deficits and of course, the national debt. The refusal of Congress to support Obama's modest direct jobs stimulus was the reason that the last recovery was so slow, that high unemployment lingered for years, and that the deficits became so huge. We know all this from the historic record. You merely parrot lies from Republican propaganda """"think tanks"""", with no understanding or knowledge of the subject.

While many of Ontario's working population are forced to compete with global competition; there remains those privileged employees who can extort their monopoly position.

Unfortunately many generations are now on the hook for her previous gifts to the labour movement.

One has to wonder what the public opinion on globalization would be had the public sector been hit as hard as the private sector.

I opted OUT of successful full-time employment in my sector of choice at age 33.  I was dead-ended and bored. Went into business for myself. Gave myself a corporate identity and incorporated it. These are formalizations of the part-time contract approach I willingly adopted.  MANY contracts, overlapping time-lines, as many clients as I could handle (about a dozen was my limit in any 6-month period.) Lots of secrets of success learned along the way: 1. Work hard and fast; those contracts will become long-term client relationships. 2. Look for opportunities to """"enrich"""" those contracts & seize them. 3. Keep overhead low (work from home) 4. Hire the best in their biz on free-lance  or one-off basis, thank them for good work; pay them on time. They'll be incredibly loyal. 5.

(This is not to imply there is a single entity of 'male homosexuality', any more than there is one entity of depression or one entity of schizophrenia.

0,"There are many other ways to protect the victims of abuse. Simply housing them in a facility (in almost like a half-way house) is NOT empowering them. Instead, it keeps them reminded that they are victims and now victims of a system where they are oppressed yet again. The reason that the other states do not have such shelters is already stated. For example, in a system where equal rights are sustained, why are women with children denied of such a service? Yes, because it would be too expensive to house women with children. That alone violates equal opportunity. There are services available to women who are victims of abuse. And we have a police and sheriff's deputies that can check on these victims regularly without having to have them isolated from the population. Police presence alone will help dissuade abusers from threatening or assaulting their victims. We have counselors that can do the job for far less than housing them for about two years. This project is not cost effective.

Pretty certain the NFL will soon realize that.  I am proud of country, our flag, our military and our National Anthem.  And I am proud of and respect all of our presidents. They are the President-to be respected for that alone, if nothing else.  I will not pay good money to watch any of this/them be publicly protested, even in peaceful silence. It is not why I attend sporting events. I attend because I like the sport! The competition, the athletes skills and training.

0,"Unfortunately the GOP didn't read any of the earlier memos, particularly the 2012 GOP commissioned """"Autopsy"""" that set out a milder version of today's reality.  Lindsey Graham got the memo as did Mitt Romney and a few other R's.  Unfortunately the lists of those that did and those that didn't are badly lopsided.  Including our own Three Hosemen.  The Dems also better get serious; the lack of viable Dem candidates for the primary was really a mirror of the GOP's excessive number.  With the Dem's Clinton sucked the oxygen out of the race, the GOP never had any to lose.  The GOP has some potential stars - Jon Huntsman, John Kasich, Jeff Flake of Az come to mind.  The Dems as well, Julian Castro and one that needs experience, Michelle Nunn.  Sure to be others in both parties and the possibility of a true, viable third party in a Centrist mold is intriguing.

""""Canada is joining this international effort by proposing a bail-in regime where certain long-term debt obligations of a large bank would be converted into equity in the unlikely event that the bank depleted its capital and was in danger of failing. This would be done so that bank shareholders and creditors would be responsible for recapitalizing a bank in financial difficulty rather than the government, taxpayers, or bank depositors.""""  http://www.cba.ca/faq-what-is-a-bail-in-regime  Note that BOTH quotes exclude bank deposits.  Bail in provisions allow banks to convert senior debt to common shares in the event of a bank requiring recapitalization.  Remember, what happened in Cypress under current law could not happen here.  Yes the government could change laws, but they could also remove CDIC insurance altogether, so the cap as you call it is always in danger of future change.

The will of the Democrats in the state was not reflected in the caucuses.  It was reflected in the Primary vote.  The caucus was held on a weekend morning, at a single time, preventing many working people from participating.

0,"EN,  You misunderstand my use of millstone.  The majority of NATO nations other than the US are more than happy to take our money and have our troops sitting in there country.  That should be reciprocated when we need them.  The one time we tested the NATO security agreement in Afghanistan (AF), most nations refused to fight other than in self-defense.  Most of those nations initially willing to fight, quit after taking casualties, e.g. Canada and the Netherlands.  The British and French only allowed for offensive operations in their own limited sectors.  Not only did we foot the bill for most of these non-contributing members in AF, we took casualties when we would have to go their rescue and drain our capabilities when we left units in their sectors to protect out NATO allies.  That is what I mean by millstone.  If NATO isn't willing to fully commit when they agree they should as they did in AF why should we agree to fully commit when one or more of them need us?

0,"billy,  Statistics have shown that the majority of Canadians down even fill the $5,500 TFSA contribution limit.  That reduction allowed the Liberals to lower middle class taxes and enhance the Canada Child Tax benefit to help young families.  If you think the average Canadian was better off under the Conservatives system, you're kidding yourself.  You're probably a more affluent Canadian, and just resent having to pay a little bit more to help young, middle class families get by day to day.  RRSP's rules were not changed under the Liberals, so that point is irrelevant. The increase in CPP is indeed small, but it's an increase, which is good given that not even baby boomers have saved enough for retirement.  This means future generations will at least be a little bit better prepared. OAS eligibility is sustainable if we make it so, it's will to act, not sustainability that's lacking. And fact is, everyone knows the average middle class Canadian is better off than before. Prove otherwise

But the thing is, each time they finalized a bill, they tasked the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) to crunch the numbers and make sure the numbers added up and I see no news about any bills or proposals being sent to the CBO. If they really have a bill, but see no need to send it to the CBO, then Republicans are basically getting ready to screw over 30 million Americans who gained access to health insurance from the ACA.

He realizes he can't take money with him when he goes,but what he can do is get himself a place in the history books. And, being Trump, he wants to be viewed as the greatest leader we have had. He also seems to crave wanting to be loved, being viewed as a hero and have a """"saint"""" like status. Perhaps he envisions his photo going into homes all over America and seeing it hanging next to the """"greats"""" of history. Maybe even a few candles burning by his photo. He can't get that if is hated and feared. He has to viewed as someone """"big"""" enough to make changes on his former positions. I don't really care what he spins in his Walter Mitty mind as long as he actually does good and great things for our country. Realizing of course, he won't do everything I'd like to see,  but if he does what I feel is most important,so be it!

Sirius' President always says that its biggest competitor is traditional FM radio. This is because many of Sirius' most popular shows are like FM music shows, broadcast live from a studio with a host, usually nationally known, and top guests, attracted by Sirius' national audoence. - Another easy way to distinguish Sirius from Spotify and Pandora is that Sirius XM has grown continuously over ten years into a great cash cow, generating 1.5 billion dollars a year on 5 billion in revenue.

Suggesting that two putative straight men might be romantically or sexually involved is extra funny: it emasculates them, subjecting them to ridicule and derision. Imagine if Colbert suggested that another Putin ally, Marine Le Pen, is good only for sexual acts, or joked about a romance between Trump and Le Pen: such jokes would likely be (rightly) criticized as both misogynistic and humourless.  --------------  The irony is, """"progressive"""" snowflakes are the first ones to shout down any criticism and run for their safe spaces, lest they be triggered, but are perfectly ok using homophobic humour to make their point.

A case can be made that with age comes the wisdom of experience, historical knowledge, perspective and so a better chance to make valid comparisons and assessments.  As well, age tends to foster a cynicism about glitz, glibness and other superficialities disguised as substance.  One could argue that an in depth examination of the three main parties platforms and leaders in the 2015 federal election and the ultimate result bear out this caution regarding the benefits of an ever younger political class both as candidates and voters.

Toronto is an extremely popular city: clean, safe, job opportunities, accepting to all cultures/ppl. That means many people want to live here (demand is high).

0,"At the heart of Catholic teaching is the belief that if we get sexual and family relationships right the world will become a more loving and safe place. Briefly put, the Catholic teaching on sexual morality centers on sexual activity being an act of self giving love, intended by God to bring children into the world and permanent marriage is directed at raising them in a stable, other centered environment where individual needs and desires are sacrificed for the good of one's spouse, one's children and one's own parents and extended family - and ultimately the wider community. Selfish expression of the sexual desire and seeking one's own pleasure, are separated from God's design for our happiness and well being and undermine the basic building block of a peaceful world.  To simplistically caricature these teachings as a """"primitive religion of punishment/appeasement""""just misses the point completely and is disingenuous.

Unless, that is, some 'sentimentalist' chose not to prosecute because you are so clearly of low intelligence and character that nobody would actually take you seriously.  See how that works? Once you throw law and decency out, all you have is yourself. And if I were you, I wouldn't get too used to having nice things. Because in the apocalypse, you'd be the first idiot shot.  Tell me, how did you read an article about radical humaneness and come out wishing for a dictator-style ruler and killing in the streets? I think your life is too boring and easy.

0,"Shocking that the trawl industry wants the same opportunity to own and consolidate the fishery that the other fleets have turned into a personal and corporate bonanza by privatizing the fishery? No, not really. An old friend of mine put it very well in another article.  “Had elements of the program not been so focused on privatizing and monetizing the fishery, there could have been the broad structure of a plan. But there was no acceptance for compromise,” said Jeff Stephan, a Kodiak fishermen and one of the council Advisory Panel’s most outspoken opponents of catch shares.""""  The Alaska tradition of good management has nothing to do with giving away the rights to fish to the few who have fished the most in the past. It has to do with setting limits on licenses, limits on efforts, effective management and protecting the small boat distributive fishing fleet. It likewise has nothing to do with allowing the processing industry to dictate to the fishermen what and when they catch.

0,"First, this is a well-done article. Second, correlation is not causation. The somewhat sensational headline suggests more than correlation. The body of the article takes a more nuanced approach. As more people consume pot, more will have measurable amounts long after the psychoactive components have worn off, so the numbers will go up even if the drivers involved in fatal accidents are not high at the time of the crash.  CO and WA - among others - must pool their abundant pot-tax resources and conduct comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of the impacts of THC on driver (and other) behaviors.  Driving while impaired is a problem - assuming that drivers who've consumed THC are dangerously impaired at some measurable level during some measurable time after consumption. But the article admits that many of those involved in fatal accidents could have consumed THC long before, and it shows other substances involved, too.  This article is largely speculative, and we need real evidence.

During the 5 years between 2007 (the approximate year he made 18), and 2012, did he make any attempt to return to the place of his birth, and seek admission through legal US immigration processes?  Did he submit to the US government and admit his illegal status and seek some sort of dispensation within Congressional made immigration law?  And, he is 28.  I don't know all the technicalities of DACA, but I understand the age ceiling is 30 yrs. old.  Does Fuentes plan on leaving the US in 2 years?  Or, does a new argument for staying suddenly pop up then?  I'm assuming facts about Fuentes based on the reporting.  But, the reporting indicates that for 5 years he lived as an adult absolutely llegal.

Their dedication and willingness to put their lives on the line only raised morale.  I'm not a fan of Trump personally, though I do identify with a lot of his policies, namely those that reduced taxes, regulation and government interference with the economy.  But he is most often wrong on the social side of things and he is VERY wrong here.

0,"Kevin, once again we see a contradiction in terms from you:  With respect to Rome's futile ban on contraception, you say, """"... refusing to fully partake in His creation by deliberately denying another the opportunity of life, is sinful and this is known innate by mankind,"""" simply does not comport with reality and is therefore false.  HV also points to the """"unitive"""" value of the marital act, which would allow responsible married adults to make responsible choices--which most Catholics do (or have done).  In order for something to be accepted as a """"basic innate truth"""" it has to be demonstrably """"true"""" which it is not.  I think your problem is that you're taking a scientific approach to faith/theology which does not work, in fact is the rigid, formulaic approach that Jesus condemned. I do appreciate that you are working toward a solution but IMO you are going about it the wrong way. Until Rome can show humility and admit to past faults (including bad doctrine) it will continue to falter.

0,"Investment income in a corporation is taxed at the top marginal tax rate, 53% in Ontario. Many use their corporations to save for retirement because they can defer tax, like an RRSP, but tax still has to be paid when it comes out. Since business owners don't a have a pension plan, this is their best way to save a similar amount for their retirements if they don't need the extra income for their business.  Morneau was comparing a business owner to public employees saying they pay more tax than the business owner, but they also have a publicly funded pension plan. If you look at he commuted value of a public sector employee, at retirement for say a teacher, the value is usually in the $1,400,000 range, meaning it would take that much money to fund their pension until life expectancy. Should the owner of a business with no guaranteed pension not be allowed to try and save something to fund their own retirements? Again they still pay tax when the money comes out.

The part about requiring government departments to identify wasteful spending within 100 days of him taking office is a great step. The path this country is on is bankruptcy. If you think everything is hunky dory, just wait until our bond rating drops (which has almost happened) and everyone begins off loading the bonds. It is a financial nightmare given our bonds are the standard across the world.  People think a lot of what he said isn't true and is grim, but it really is true.

The good news is that population may decrease but not soon enough to avoid disaster unless something else happens. When a tractor replaces a horse T is greater than 1 and increase impact.  When technology like solar, wind, transmission, and storage replace coal and gas, T can be less than 1; When an artificial leaf use renewable energy to convert CO2 into ethanol T is less than 1; When an artificial leaf sequesters CO2 to produce carbon fiber to replace forest wood T is much less than 1.

0,"Exactly, but they won't. The tinkering on this issue started a long time ago when the government said women could deduct the years spent raising children from their CPP contribution years, effectively having men subsidize women for the years they spent having children. That also discriminates against women who decide not to have children which IIRC is about 10% of women.

We will never know if the forecasts for the three new core measures were realized or not, as quite shamefully, the BoC  didn’t publish these in the January MPR.  We do know that the forecast for the previous operational guide, CPIX, for 2016Q4 annual inflation in the October MPR was way too high: 1.9%, as compared to an actual inflation rate of 1.6%. Greg Quinn writes that “Bartlett forecasts the three core measures of inflation will remain below 2 per cent through 2020.” This may well be true, but it is in glaring contrast to the MPR saying that “we would expect all inflation measures to converge sustainably on 2 per cent in the latter part of our projection horizon [i.e. by 2018Q4]”, as Quinn should know. This is about as likely to happen as sighting a unicorn, but this kind of promise is consistent with the Bank of Canada’s “jam tomorrow” mindset.

It has been well established that there is a dearth of connections for rural internet, where some cable companies will often offer cost estimates of $25,000+ to connect a farm to the internet. I would say today, the Internet is a necessary aspect of being in modern society, and meets many of the definitions of a utility from a neoclassical/libertarian economics standpoint. With the FCC under-investing in broadband expansion, it is up to the states to pick up the slack. You are correct, marginal increases in investment in education don't necessarily increase performance, but the correlation isn't consistent. Did you propose to your state representative ways to increase the value for public funds spent on education? You sound very knowledgeable on the topic, I'm curious on why your representative didn't submit a bill incorporating your suggestions.

Many of this Republican Majority have exhibited a host of questionable, if not outright unethical behavior.  Several of this Republican Majority are directly employed by oil companies, and have consistently pushed legislation and voted in a manner that favors oil companies over the interests of the State.  This Republican Majority continues to fund """"pie in the sky"""" infrastructure, which in many cases, provides them great personal benefit.  As we saw in the last legislative session, the Republican Majority is more than willing to let this state burn for their own benefit.  We have many problems. Partisanship and voters who fail to look at facts or accept realities are two of the biggest.

The bishops of the time talked Rome out this condemnation, because they were doing no such thing, at least not openly.  Of course, Vatican II turned the view that democracy should not be accommodated on its head, although there is still more to go, especially on the abortion issue.  In America, abortion is protected under privacy, the right to act without the interference of the majority or those who would motivate them (like the Church).  There is no abortion law, unlike Europe where a positive law regulates how it can and cannot occur.

They will have an extra $400 a month to save/spend.  There may be some room for improvement with their expenses, too. Some points:  Property taxs look high relative to the value of their home, even if the valuation given is out of date. Maybe this covers other items?  $250 per month to charity? From what I read the average person in Canada gives about  $300 per year and that includes the uber rich who give really big sums. Their generosity is admirable but charity begins at home.  Gardening at $175 per month? They should be able to cut this way back. Weeds require no maintenance.  This couple is doing reasonably well overall and should consider itself fortunate, even if it cannot indulge like others do. Likely those others are living on debt.

0,"Then we also need to know what our housing stock is being built for.  Who are we building for?  The commodification of housing over the years in metro Vancouver has seen entire complexes presold overseas for investment units, or second homes.  Some cities, like Richmond, have a very high percentage of it's units sold and vacant, estimated to be almost 50% in the downtown core.  Areas of Vancouver near transit hubs, like Marine and Cambie, are estimated to be 25% sold and vacant.  Tens of thousands of vacant housing units.  Do we just continue to build - and sell overseas or for speculation?  Are we building homes or safety deposit boxes or sporadically occupied second or third vacation homes?  Trying to predict immigration and settlement patterns is only a small part of the equation - we need the bigger conversation on housing commodification and demand via money generated offshore.

You'll go to college over my dead body.""""  Just as working women leave a job that is far less hostile than a campus, females are dropping out of college and fewer are enrolling.  Right?  Wrong! More women are going to college now than men -- a reversal of just ten years ago.  How can that be?! Answer: the one-in-four is false and is part of feminists' and Obama's war on men.

That their lives will be ruined and their child will be a suffering burden. This sets up abortion as the preferred way to handle a sad situation. It says their child's life isn't worthy of living.  The reality is that raising a disabled child is difficult, but can also enrich a family in remarkable ways.

Mr. Stanfield was ranked #1 among all these CEOs.  Among his great strengths was making people comfortable enough to always level with him.  In 1972, Stanfield caught 13 passes in a row before dropping one.  Predictably, the liberal media showed the dropped pass.  Stanfield was twice the leader Trudeau ever was.

In their 2002 book, “Catholic Divorce:  The Deception of Annulments”, Joseph Martos and Pierre Hegy state:  “Because the grounds for annulment have become so broad that practically anyone who applies for one can obtain it, many observers now regard annulments as ‘virtual divorces.’  After all, the same grounds for divorce in a civil court have ‘become grounds for the nonexistence of marriage in an ecclesiastical court.’  (Page 23)  To add to the deceit, many couples who receive annulments do so believing that their marriage was, in fact, sacramentally valid – that the marital bond did exist but that, over time, it began to break down.  These couples, understandably, choose not to disclose this part of the story to marriage tribunals so that they can qualify for an annulment.”  In other words it is a chuchy game of """"nudge, nudge, wink, wink""""--

I saw and discussed several polls with researchers that provided polling for major investors and banks and they had it right and called it right even if they had doubts-- I was convinced looking at maps, charts, and data. A lot of the polls were pointing correctly for a Trump victory especially looking carefully at states like North Carolina, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin-- but the pollsters could not believe the data and called it wrong. What my friends told me later was that the polls were right, but the pollsters were wrong.

I think it starts with a commitment to move away from the magazine approach to Catholic journalism and toward investigative reporting and analytical commentary -- which is a far cry from """"this is what I think about what I saw on TV last night."""" Ironically, this is where NCR has done its best work over the years, so I would wonder at a decision not to pursue this precisely when everyone in America is concerned about our common future.  I think it's fair to say that Catholic journalism is in crisis, which may be where it can find its voice again. Just think about what someone like John Allen is doing for a living these days.

0,"Trump is Swamp Thing. One of the causes of the economic meltdown of 2008 was imprudent lending by the banks which should have done their due diligence. (Attempts to blame Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae just sounded like a kid whining """"They started it"""" without accepting any responsibility for his own actions.)  And banks have lobbied successful for years to prevent the average person from escaping debt through bankruptcy. Student loans, credit card debt, and others are not covered under bankruptcy protection. So a big company can file Chapter 11 and escape its creditors, but the John Doe and Mary Roe can't. And there lies the problem. The borrower may take on more debt than is good, but why is the lender offering too much money?  Regulations don't do enough to protect the consumer. The recent scandal involving bank employees pressured to upsell bank services to unsuspecting clients is a case in point. Strangely, it seems the least safe place to put your money is in the bank.

There is no guarantee that, as robots and technology accomplish much of our necessary work more efficiently, that an equal number of new and equally respectful jobs will be created.

Yet, if the robots and technology are truly capable, our society will be no less, and probably even more wealthy and productive. If this increase in wealth and free time is not being directed in some transformed form to the people, but instead hoarded by those who don't need it, then workers who lose jobs will be relegated either to work at jobs much below their intelligence and skill level or simply to die off. The postulates need to be rethought. Our society will become richer, with more free time, and the assumption that food, health care, and housing requires a proportionate income will have to change. This will be a big challenge to some.

Half said they did not want to be a single parent or were having problems with their husband or partner.[4]  • Fifty-one percent of abortion patients had used a contraceptive method in the month they got pregnant, most commonly condoms (27%) or a hormonal method (17%).

The National Energy Board has served the Canadian public interest very well since it was established in 1959. It is an independent, expert, quasi-judicial regulatory body supported by an expert staff that is well qualified to examine the public interest considerations relating to energy projects. It was established as a means to ensure that decisions about major energy projects were made, in the first instance, at arms' length from the partisan political process. The Harper government imposed eighteen month time limits on the duration of the review process, but left room for flexibility.

Change Medicare to a different organizational structure focused on continuously driving down costs and  improving quality of care, similar to a for-profit business in a competitive environment, by taking advantage of economies of scale from the increased number of Medicare enrollees and by adopting global best practices from countries with lower universal health care costs.  3. Medicare funding deficits under this plan for any year would be paid in the following year via an incremental additional flat tax of  X% of the deficit applied to all US health care premiums plus 100-X % on all reported pre-tax  income.

0,"Thank you for the insight, very helpful, but the statement about Hawaii having an opinion about its reality as its own nation is not the truth. If you're going to share facts, please check them first. Hawaii was recognized by England back in the early 1800,s as its own nation, America in the later part of the 1800,s acknowledged Hawaii as its own nation as well.  There was an illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, by a small group of businessmen, assisted by a branch of the American military, using machine guns. the president at the time said it was wrong and not to do it. No treaty of annexation was signed to make Hawaii a state, this is a lie. In 1993, the apology bill was passed, in it America admitted to the atrocity and its wrongful overthrow of the Hawaiian nation.  If you want to enlighten people about Hawaii, Please research the overthrow and share what you find with us all.

0,"Republicans are not simply returning Medicaid to the level of increases before Obamcare (that would just be ending Medicaid expansion, which is part of the bill). The bill goes beyond that. The per capita cap structure proposed would amount to a 25-30% reduction in the funding available to the Medicaid program that existed prior to the ACA (i.e. coverage for children, seniors, and the disabled). Over time, this would mean that Colorado would either have to spend substantially more money to meet the needs of these populations, or cut/reduce services. The per capita cap structure in this bill is attached to the consumer price index, which does not accurately account for increasing medical costs, which is why this will amount to cuts in the long run. A per capita cap structure also doesn't allow Colorado to adjust to substantial shifts in demographics and health needs of the population.

As conditions overseas will change because of this, mass immigration will be less necessary, but still welcome.  The drive for moral thinking in management has no chance in capitalism. It might in the councils of employee-owned firms, especially as these will be established on a moral basis. Likewise, the moral use of technology is more likely to be considered in these firms.

The low estimate for the Iraq war is 175,000 civilians over 14 years, or at least 12,500 per year.  (Some estimates are as high as 1M).

As the war was ending, a number of Confederate officers tried to get Lee to lead an army of guerillas to fight on. . Lee spoke to his troops and told them to go home and live in peace.  Not to hold grudges.  Not to perpetuate the struggle and suffering that had cost the nation so many lives, and to live in peace with their former enemies. . There is a reason why, at Appomattox, Grant permitted Lee to keep his sword, and why he was never tried for treason. There is a reason why Arlington National Cemetery was built in Lee's former back yard. . Lee was a man of incomparable ability, and integrity. He saw things on a higher plane. In the end, like Abraham Lincoln, he saw reconciliation as the only way forward. . He would have been disgusted by the violence in Charlottesville. . """"Strike the tent"""".

Similarly, when ISIS carries out attacks in the name of Islam, moderate Muslims unquestionably have a right, but not an obligation, to separate those actions from true Islam. That is not insecurity or immaturity, it is protecting a key part of one's identity. It's not meaningless to me when an Imam comes on TV to educate the public on what Islam actually teaches and call out ISIS for what it is. I certainly don't believe the Imam has a duty to distinguish his religion from these fanatics, but I appreciate it and don't see this as some meaningless expression of insecurity.

0,"“The decades of surpluses projected by Ottawa just two years ago have now shifted to decades of annual deficits that will run until 2050.” This is not correct. The long-term forecast still shows a deficit of $2.2B for 2050-51, although this is 0.0% of nominal GDP. The projections are only shown for every fifth year. In 2055-56, a $26.5B surplus (0.3% of GDP) is achieved. The final paragraph says: “In contrast, the 2014 forecast projected large surpluses every year, growing to $220.4-billion in 2050 [should be 2050-51]. As a share of GDP, the 2014 forecast had the size of the surplus growing from about 0.5 per cent in the 2020s to 2.9 per cent by 2050 [should be 2050-51]”. The bottom line is that in September  2015, the Liberals promised a $1B surplus in 2019-20 but now their own Finance Department projects that they won't balance the budget until at least 32 years later. Is this the worst Canadian government ever?

The ballot is never truly secret since it can be easily traced who sat where and voted what in this age of electronic warfare. 3. But most importantly, since the entire cabinet will be dissolved, how many ANC members would willingly vote against Zuma knowing that they will be out of a prestigious position, fat salary and a livelihood?

The problem is that far too many people who are not rich like Mrs. DeVos do not have the means or opportunity to benefit from that high level of education geared to the wealthy. The person in charge of education for a nation should not be a person who does not believe in universal public education and whose only experience is with charter, private and religious education.

0,"The statement that """"If Kauai can ban all plastic bags, so can Oahu."""" is kinda glossing over the reality between the two islands. I get it, if one can do it in this state, others can too, but the fact remains that it is a lot easier to convince 65,900 people on Kauai to """"get on the bandwagon"""" and make a ban work for them than it is to convince 953,200 residents of Oahu to do the same. Just the sheer fact that more people = more opinions about how the island should deal with this """"problem"""" as defined by BEACH.  Because if BEACH is going to be myopic about just forcing Oahu to follow Kauai's lead, I am afraid that they have not quite figured out how to take off their rose coloured glasses.

0,"In response to some of the people who have commented-- Don't blame your personal grudges on immigration. It is a well researched fact that immigrants are the least likely to engage in criminal behavior. And think about this-- What would you do if the shoe was on the the other foot and you found yourself unable to exist in the country where you were born? Wouldn't you also do everything you could to get somewhere safe where you could work and feed yourself? Allowing immigration is ultimately beneficial to the prosperity of a county. Look at Canada as an example. They embraced immigration and have made efforts to streamline the process. Part of why so many here are undocumented is simply because our system of legal immigration is slow and cumbersome.

This was well documented best farmland on Oahu by all ag maps and experts. .

The Chi Coms are watching everything closely as Trumps warning to North Korea is also directed at them given their aggressive actions towards their neighbors in Southeast Asia  and  India and expansionist moves in Africa.

0,"Eugene's biggest problem is that it does not have a municipal jail like Springfield does and it only rents 10-15 jail spaces from Lane County.  So, it is common knowledge with the street people that you won't do much jail time if arrested in Eugene.  Springfield has 100 jail beds and it is a city half the size of Eugene.  They only put relatively healthy prisoners in there and the rest go to Lane County.  The Lane County jail is an expensive place to incarcerate someone because it provides a full range of services which many of our street people need.  So, step up to the plate City of Eugene!  You've been avoiding the reality that the city is not pulling its fair share of the law enforcement load for many years.  Either build a municipal jail or set aside some money to rent more jail beds from Lane County.  That will get most of these people out of the park blocks and probably out of Eugene.  The Springfield jail is certainly Spartan and it works with a food budget of $4 per inmate/day

The other headed north into Canada and then south back into the U.S.  The Americans decided """"their"""" river wasn't as good as the one that flowed into Canada and stayed there. So they decided to dig a canal to take some of the water out and put it into their river. People in Alberta heard about this and decided to dig their own canal between the two rivers. They promised, whatever water the Americans diverted from the first river would be diverted right back in once the river flowed into Canada. The Albertans referred to it as the """"S;pite Canal"""".

Go look around at where the most expensive houses are in Canada. West side of Vancouver, Richmond, South Surrey.  Now, man, go look at the elementary school photos, of little kids' classes at the local schools. You will see that in many of those schools, over the course of a few decades, they suddenly went from less than 5 percent to suddenly become over 70 percent, the kids with facial features consistent with Chinese ancestry.  It is actually NOT that there are too many people and too few houses in those places.

I already explained, very clearly, how the defense of LOE and necessity allowed for him to posses the weapon. The lesser of evils doctrine dates back to Common Law, and dictates that one may commit one crime (evil #1) to prevent a more serious act from occuring (evil #2.) Evil in this case E1 = committing the offense of illegally possessing a weapon to prevent E2, E2 being a murder victim. More commonly/daily LOE defense = speeding on your way to the emergency room so your pregnant wife can deliver her baby. Exact same legal argument - different scale.

All the kings horses and all the opposition party men could not put the egg together again - not that either the Caveliers or the Round Heads would want to do so.  Journalism (defined by lack of bias) has been killed by its parents:  the advance of technology.  Any current news organization that thinks it is unbiased, is deluded.  The whole idea of unbiased reporting is not only old hat, it's pure unadulterated:  FAKE NEWS.

0,"Absolutely agree.  But it might let the tax cut for the rich slide if the Medicaid cuts are removed from the bill.  We can always raise taxes later.  Indeed, this funding should have been a VAT or HI payroll tax increase.  It still can be.  Frankly, Medicaid for Seniors and Disabled should be federalized, either in the bill or in tax reform.  This Congress won't do it, but it is the better goal.

0,"With respect, I think the columnist needs to focus less on subjective sentiments and instead  differentiate objectively between the rule of law, kinds of laws, the function of police officers in theory, and the real-life cultures of police departments across Canada. We have the rule of law (thank god), we have very just laws rooted in a wonderful Charter, and we have a police force to enforce laws. All good. But unfortunately, some (<I said some) persons in police culture have poor regard for aboriginal victims of crime, sexual assault victims, persons of colour (cf. racial profiling & harassment), and sometimes LGBTQ persons. It's been proven that many departments have too high a percentage of masculinist, abusive, code-of-silence types. If Pride wants to send a message that it's bothered by all of that by excluding police for a while, good on them. It's obvious that Pride's decision does not reflect a disrespect for laws generally.

0,"You are so clueless as to how especially young women are so emotionally confused when they become pregnant and seems to them they have no one at all trusted to turn to. Your message to them is that they are sinners.  Most abortions in this nation are performed on women between the ages of 20-30 and many already have other children at home. I am sure a lot of them have cars and do not need to use a bicycle to go to Planned Parenthood. Teens girls as young as 14 yrs of age having sex have a lot of other social problems . No, it is not normal for a girl as young as 14 to want """"sex"""" and they are often coerced into having sexual relationships before they mature. That is part of the rape culture in this state and that needs to be seriously addressed.  You gave me a visions of innocent 14 yr olds girls riding a bike to PP getting an abortion and then maybe meeting their friends for a movie afterwards is the most callous thing I have heard from a Pro Lifer.

In 1782, Judge Sir Francis Buller is reported as having made this legal ruling and in the following year James Gillray published a satirical cartoon attacking Buller and caricaturing him as 'Judge Thumb'. The cartoon shows a man beating a fleeing woman and Buller carrying two bundles of sticks. The caption reads """"thumbsticks - for family correction: warranted lawful!""""

0,"In all fairness the same argument should be applied when considering voting for Mrs. Clinton as well.  Educated Catholics should know what our Lord and Savior Jesus teaches about the sanctity of human life and His commandment """"not to kill"""".  In simplest terms it means thou shall """"not murder"""", which means no one should ever take an """"innocent life"""".  Many people will argue and debate, as well as pervert, this commanded teaching and Truth to justify their own ends but those who support abortion have no case to do so whatsoever.  A human being developing in the """"safety"""" of his or her mother's womb is completely innocent of everything except original sin and unless we want to corrupt Christ's teaching of the Truth even more than many already do, then no faithful Christian of any denomination can support or vote for any one or group who actively advocates for such killing!  According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, supporting abortion in any way's a grave sin also!!!

If I saw this culture really care about the poor and the powerless, the abandoned and the unwanted, and If I saw a real shortage of humans, I would feel differently. I do recognize that the far right has as its main goal to reverse Roe V.Wade, not for the health of the mother or the child, but to control women. If the far right control the White House and Congress for another six years, Roe V. Wade will be history and you will get your way.   Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

0,"Hawaiian is a primitive language developed through centuries of isolation on a few islands.  No surprise it lacked words for European and Asian geographic and technological elements and lacked grammatical structures for European and Asian cultural nuances.  English has 3 """"cases"""", German has 4, Russian has 6; Hawaiian has zero cases and no noun declension.  UH professors have a committee which invents new Hawaiian words for outside concepts.  Maybe they need a committee to invent new grammatical patterns for outside thought patterns.  But maybe it's impossible for a primitive language to adapt to fundamentally different cultures without morphing itself to become something the ancient speakers would not recognize as their own.  This is Merrie Monarch weekend.  You must choose whether to perform kahiko or auana when you speak Hawaiian just as you must make that choice in performing hula.
