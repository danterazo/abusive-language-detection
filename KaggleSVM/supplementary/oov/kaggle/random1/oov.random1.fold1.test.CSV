0,"""""Yes with the ensuing great inflation.""""  My point was that if money was actually being removed from Canada, you could print money without inflation, which would be great. But it's not.  """"Why would we complain about China ending up owning Canada?""""  I have no way of knowing how old you are, but if you remember the late 80s and early 90s, there was exactly the same alarmism as there is now. Americans were panicking that their country was being sold out -- to Japan.  In economic terms, it was never a real threat, no more than Chinese trade is now.

1,"Of course you are right - the project went bankrupt, for the third or fourth time. Trump merely took the money and ran, essentially stripping the venture of liquid assets. As his son Eric Trump said, """"We walked away with millions."""" Trump made most of his fortune by ripping off others in bankruptcy procedures. He wasn't smart enough, he just hired smart New York lawyers.  Your tropes are paranoid, your politics are toxic. You are ignorant except you fill in your mental vacuum with the worst sort of trashy propaganda. Have the life you deserve.

0,"Thank you for your positive review. I fear, however, it does not no justice to the quality of the performance. Jennifer Martin should be showered with praise for her ability, as Associate Director and Ballet Mistress, to support performances in the roles of Giselle and Albrecht that were beyond stunning. Both dancers were exquisite representations of the finest in classical ballet. The last time I saw Giselle was many, many years ago with American Ballet Theatre, possibly the premier American company. This performances was certainly as good, and may have been better. Eugene Ballet has often been in the forefront for quality of regional ballet. This performance was no exception and deserves the highest possible praise.

0,"I'm not a fan of EMX. The downtown station to UO is heavily used, the rest not so much(my observation anyway). If federal money hadn't been so generous it never would have been built and I think no great loss to the area if that had occurred. EMX isn't the only infrastructure that can be built. I'd like to have seen a feasibility study done on a route(not EMX) that would connect West Eugene to Springfield Gateway area via the Beltline(and maybe even a complete loop to the Eugene Station via Delta Hwy/105) . To my knowledge that hasn't been done. This would could require some station building to made it work. The (unfortunate )planned move of the River Ave station to Hunsaker makes this a less desirable option than it would otherwise have been, but doesn't rule it out entirely. Another option is to heavily push and provide for van pooling/ride sharing.  cont.

0,"For everyone who is surprised that banks and other financial institutions don't mislead the public, I suggest you grow up.  To think for a minute that a bank or other institution is not in the business to make money and mislead the public with it's advertising is ridiculous. If your a investor, reading the fine print is a given, and if you can't do that, then I suggest you don't invest or buy bank products. I own all five Canadian bank stocks and I am proud of it as they consistently pay dividends and appreciate in value. I am sure Ian the CEO of TD  is really listening.

But when it comes to the government, or worse, some Ivory-tower """"expert"""", micro-managing how I should spend my money, because they """"know best"""", I don't think so.  Define the goals - less energy use, less run-off, more plants - then define some incentives - can build more square feet on the same lot, will get my permits more quickly, a credit on property taxes - then let me weigh the options and find the BEST solution for what I need to do.  Just throwing some dirt and plants on a warehouse roof ain't gonna save the world, nor are solar panels in Denver's hail-prone environment.  It'd be a good thing if we outlawed guns and hate, as well, along with body odor and bad attitudes - let's start a petition campaign to do that!

I have better things to do with my time.  Personally, I do like to be told if I have made a mistake. People have commented on my style since I have been partaking of the comment scene. I used to & still do sometimes write using my own form of speedwriting (mostly when I use my phone), & have received snotty replies not about my content, but my choice of words or spelling. Of course, I consider the source of the rude remarks & let them off the hook sometimes. I know this really cool law. It's called the law of reciprocity aka the golden rule. I like to think I apply this rule in some of my dealing with others. Also, the thought has hit my mind on occasion, maybe there is a really good reason this person doesn't seem to have the hang of writing. We rarely really know what is going on in a person's life so to be rude can be unbecoming.

That a reflection on my life where I have always found more things to like about people than I can find to dislike.  So to get criticized on the civil rating stinks.   I suspect but do not know, that I tolerate far more conversation that the norm.   I think being committed and even aggressive in your opinions, (if they aren't personal), is what civil conversation needs.  So I ask the RG Staff to clarify just what guideline I'm breaking when it comes to rating the civility of others.    *Which might be done after reading the entire article and the string , not to just give us a truncated statement and the often truncated reply.  I don't try to figure out why a person, or, the RG does things.  It's easier to just ask them a clarifying question.

0,"Well said.  One of the bogus Liberal talking points for the gullible and uninformed is to write off Scheer's experience as just a few years on the back benches  The reality is Scheer defeated then 34 year MP Lorne Nystrom the dean of the House when he was 25 in 2004 and defeated him by 3 x the 2004 margin in 2006.  Andrew has served in parliament for 13 years through 5 elections compared with Trudeau`s 5 years and 2 elections when he became a party leader.  At 28, Scheer was appointed a deputy speaker in the House making him among the youngest ever to be chosen for that role in The Commonwealth.  When he as 32 in 2011, Andrew was elected by his peers as the Speaker in the House,  the youngest MP ever chosen for this demanding and sensitive job in charge of parliament, its budget and its staff and compensated accordingly.  Only a fool or a knave would call this a backbench position.  After the 2015 election, Ambrose chose Scheer as House Leader, a key role for the official opposition.

No. just No. Yes I understand Ward is a free agent next year. He is only 30. Offer him a deal similar to Stewart minus a year and a bit less guaranteed, see if he takes it. This is the same logic we applied to Trevathan, we could have kept him and Marshall, now our ILB besides Marshall are average at best and now they want to break up the best part of the team, the No fly zone. Jamal Carter is not Ward. Simmons and Parks haven't done anything yet. Getting rid of Ward, a big part of the heart of the defense and a leader would be a mistake. Don't do it Elway.

The vast majority of Black Lives Matter people are peaceful, nonviolent and do not condone violence and are just as horrified by the shootings as anyone else. But you do have to admit that the reporting is a bit different than it would otherwise be. Most of the reports about the two shootings identify the officers as white and the victims as black, over and over. I have heard almost no mention of the race of either the victims or the shooter in this incident.

0,"Indeed it is Beans, but I have lost track the number of times I have heard Christians referring to the Old Testament to justify a belief or action. Nor did Christ say his words are to displace previous scripture.  And, of course, there is a major religious group that does not accept the New as scripture). Then again, Christians have spent many centuries persecuting that group despite the generous words of Christ.

Until there is an equal voice from all political parties in the very first debates of the election and beyond, this embarrassing, contradicting, and insulting show will never end.  I noticed that the climax of Sanders speech and the cheers and applause that followed did not come close to the resounding cheers he received at his introduction.

That's the opposite of sustainability.  As far as downtown, yes if you pony up over $100 million you can get developers to invest. Built-in equity is always a win for insider players. However, who actually thinks downtown is functioning? It's becoming not just unsightly but dangerous.

He aims to cause a war, or to blackmail everybody.  He is using Japan, and Guam  as his target practice while he reifines his targeting and increases dramatically his weapons.  Now he has a Hydrogen bomb, which is 10-100 x's more powerful than what he had 6 months ago.  At what point does this stop?  We can take him out in a week if we want to, or he can continue doing this stuff and scaring the entire world while demanding we take it.

0,"Hello Ausexpat,  Thank you for verifying the characterization that I wrote.  However, no, wrong, your own characterization of me is false.  You claim that my message on these boards has been """"unCanadian"""".  Nope, it has been as Canadian as Canadian gets.  See, the thing is, Canada has a long-standing cultural tradition, going back hundreds of years, of having local workers in cities here able to buy a house nearby for the family, from which to travel back and forth to city jobs.  Canada had that always in all cities, in the 1800s, the 1920s, the 1950s, the 1960s, well into the 1980s.  What ended that tradition owning a family house nearby?  For Vancouver it was overseas money flooding in, through the radical new experiment of investor immigrants. That shot house prices to dozens of times the average annual local income.  Sorry, but no, support for returning Canadian housing to its long-standing cultural tradition of ownership by the locally employed, that is a fully Canadian interest.

In my opinion they should not apply but rather get a few additional years of specialized training and then they will have the credentials and knowledge to boost them up to the high salary ranks.  While there are exceptions, those who quit at HS level are forever locked into subordinate positions with salaries far below the top dogs.  Sending HS students to companies for exposure is great.  Telling them that only a HS degree makes them eligible for top flight jobs, excepting the rare genius, is a lie and is not productive.

To victimized wildlife you're wildlife terrorists Alaska Board of Game and lapdog ADFG biologist assassins.

Plumlee had drawn ZERO interest elsewhere and could have been signed for half that amount - maybe even a third.  Plumlee is a major deficiency on defense. He is slow and can't jump.

So, obviously, to be guilty under that subsection required proof of intent. Clinton, however, would not be charged under the same subsection as the defendant in Gorin.  The section under which she would be charged is 793(f)(1), which does not require """"intent or reason to believe,"""" but only """"gross negligence.""""

When Djou was on the City Council, the full 34-mile route (the Locally Preferred Alternative or LPA) was approved by the council.  The only reason the initial """"Minimum Operable Segment"""" or MOS of 20-miles and 21-stations (East Kapolei to Ala Moana Center) was chosen for the beginning of this construction boondoggle was to apply for Federal $$$.  And the City/HART will apply for more Federal money for the remaining segments of the full 34-mile plan.  So when Djou WROTE THE BILL which created HART and gave it the blank check (i.e. no restrictions to spend the amount that voters were told in 2008), he gave HART full authority to build the ENTIRE 34-mile LPA.  NO VOTER APPROVAL NECESSARY.  It's already current law.  They just need the money.  So, """"George"""", tell the truth.

0,"I was talking about an accountant.  You don't need to have a union to have an employment contract. A contract under the law is an agreement, it need not even be written down. He offered a job with certain pay and benefits and the employee accepted by taking the job on those stated terms. He violated that contract by not abiding by the agreed upon pay. That's actionable, no union needed.  All unions do nowadays is require the employee to pay them for something the employee can do for themselves. Closed shops and mandatory payroll deductions prevent workers from operating in their own best interest. If unions really had something valuable to offer they wouldn't need government to extract their dues and run their protection rackets for them, employees would voluntarily pay for the """"benefits"""" they bring.

In fact Canada is quite full, as the comfortably habitable area of Canada is more akin to the total area of say Poland, or Spain - countries with fewer than 50 million people.  2. This coincides with the population of all the US states that border Canada - around 50 million people, although in at least two cases - New York, and Minnesota, the bulk of the population is as far from the Canadian border as possible..This is because (climatically, at least) the """"best"""" areas of Canada = the """"worst"""" areas of the USA.  3. Several studies from Sweden and Switzerland indicate that there is no need for a constantly growing population to maintain a standard of living.  4. Japan is showing that an aging population is no issue either. What is eventide from Japan as it ages is just that - lifespan in increasing. That is not a sign of a struggling country.

This attitude is seen throughout Liberal Canada.  The mighty Wynne is pouring millions into emergency shelters for women and children (no problem with that) but is completely ignoring men and their children who face domestic violence.  As far as I know there is not one shelter for men fleeing domestic violence in all of Ontario and only one help line run by a municipality.

1,"What a bunch of IDIOTS. The most fair and COLLECTIBLE tax is a SALES TAX. The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services. The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive """"toys"""", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax.

I think if you can give people that, you’ll create an intense loyalty,” he said.  Once upon a time in a land far away...  Full time jobs are disappearing(except for public hires) with benefits being modified(DB...to DC if you are lucky). If the job doesn't suit you, go get another (or get more training for that other job). Eventually as you gain experience(and field respect) a career  and you will form.  Usually millennials don't have  enough real world experience to demand more than a safe work environment.

0,"This is getting rather scary.  I own a single family rental and never raised the rent on tenants (two in the last 7 years) other than to cover bond measures, increased property taxes and insurance.  I've always kept the house and its appliances in good repair or replaced or fixed the issue immediately if needed.  in the last 7 years I have put on a new roof, new flooring, new furnace, new water heater, new a/c unit, etc.  I'm not making a fortune to be sure.  But If I am now going to lose my private property rights to sell this rental if I need to for health reasons  - as it wouldn't be considered a for cause eviction - or not being allowed to increase the rent because of a freeze to cover expenses, I may be better off selling it now at market rate instead of continuing to provide an  affordable rental option in my neighborhood.  Unless they exempt single family rental housing, I don't have much of an option financially.

0,"Thank you for validating my point, that neo-libs & neo-cons are two sides of the same coin 214. The only difference in opinion, is who gets the money being doled out.  Yes the CPC wants to 'privatize' which means to sole or closed sourced the operation to either one or a small series of vendors (neo-conservatism). The general belief here is that a 'private' vendor can operate the service for less cost. However without the pressure of competition, service declines and costs sky-rocket (think 407 highway in Ontario)  Trudeau wants an arms-length bureaucracy (neo-liberalism). The general belief here is that an 'arms-length' operation can operate the service free from political influence. However without the pressure of competition, service declines and costs sky-rocket (think CRTC overseeing communications)  What both parties don't want is a free market place where no players are funded at the expense of all vendors and competition drives prices down and service quality up.

0,"Only one little problem... unless you plan for all those nifty new plants and grass to die after planting, you're not going to let the soil dry out.  You're going to irrigate it to keep it moist.  Which, BTW, gets back to the significant cost element for having to build roofs to support the weight of all that heavy, moist soil.  Plus planter boxes, plus trees/plants.  Plus of course the extra cost of materials and weekly landscaping services.

The Spring 2017 Kuleana Class recently concluded and a third program will start in Sept.. As to who will lead the political/electoral revolution?

Whether myth, allegory, morality play, or apocalypse the stories are not """"mere"""" forms but tell of something deeper. To say, """"If 'Adam and Eve' did not exist, neither did their 'sin'"""" is like saying, """"If Aphrodite did not exist, love does not exist, either"""".

In 2012, Zinke signed Montana Constitutional Governance Pledge to transfer federal lands to the state. In 2014, Zinke supports a bill by Paul Ryan proposing to pay off the national debt by selling public lands. Zinke supports a DC written bill that would turn over Montana’s public lands to out-of-state developers and cut access to hunting and fishing. There are several more instances of Zinke voting to privatize public lands, to sell off public lands, and lock up land. . He also claims to be pro-gun, but Montana shooting groups give him a zero rating. Dishonest corrupt Zinke should be removed from office.

The PM is just another MP when you get right down to it, and becomes leader at the Party's convention.   So not sure how your #1 would be implemented.     It is up to the party members to decide who leads their party.  3) would guarantee that our perpetual election cycle gets even worse.  4) Definitely agree  5) Another one that would be hard to enforce and harder to police.    The In and Out Scam was about this type of thing (except in reverse - it was about spending Federally vs at the Constituent level).  I would add that Political donations should NOT given any tax credits.

0,"The argument extending child sexual abuse by priests in comparison with public schools, or other institutions, makes me more than a little crazy.  While I'm sure we all, especially victims themselves and their families, abhor the reprehensible acts and those who committed them, the REAL problem has been the enabling, by supervising clerics and bishops, of FUTURE ACTS to other children.  There may be psychological rationalization of the abuse and abusers themselves, but there is NO good reason under heaven for the actions and inactions of those who made the choice to put more children at risk -- and at the same time not proceeding against perpetrators within the legal system.  Of course there is child sexual abuse in families, in public schools, in social groups and other organizations specific to children.  Families may themselves choose to not involve the law, but I've surely read many more accounts of non-priests being prosecuted than I ever have priests -- coverups skipped.

Of course, one is never given because the point of misdirection is not to lead us TO sources of information, the point of misdirection is to lead us AWAY from sources of information, in this case by introducing a speculative school of red herrings to the discussion.

Some will say, no need to read any newspapers (except a few) because they are telling lies. But how can anyone know if the claim is true unless one reads the story first? The continued attempt to dismiss journalism outright has done those who would silence the press a favor. Without firing a shot, they have convinced enough people to simply not use their right to a free press as guaranteed under the First Amendment. For the most part, these are the same people who claim to to Constitutionalists. Yet they pick and choose to read only the news that they know in advance will confirm their beliefs. Press that only tells the story people want to hear is not free. It's paid by the clicks of those who seek to confirm their assumptions. Like a poll, the clicks of agreement tell the editors, """"give me more lies I can believe in.""""

If he finds a way to do that, and he might, he will have solved a problem no other president has been able to. But he has to get elected first, not an easy thing when running against a person powerful enough to keep from being indicted for obvious felonies that even the Director of the CIA, a former celebrated general, could not avoid for much lesser violations.

There are several referenda per year.  If the government disregards the wishes of citizens, it is immediately corrected.  Representatives try to avoid this dishonor.  Switzerland doesn't, for example, run deficits and, for another, isn't run by lobbies.  One has the idea that purgatory for a lobbyist is to be in Bern.

The need to get to federal recognition via a governing entity so that OHA can then transfer its assets to it and essentially wipe the slate clean of any wrong/illegal doings has to happen.  Unfortunately in todays world of politics we see to many wrong doings and costly mistakes while career politicians even here in Hawaii take advantage and exploit our Hawaiian value system """"aloha"""" to either continue or clean up there mess.

Amusing, isn't it? It just shows the burgeoning lack of perspective that comes our shift to the left and deep dive into the politics of resentment.  Canada is a great country but everyday we become more fractured into identity groups and regional interests; any semblance of a whole quickly deteriorating.

A 25 times increase in the number of insurers ought to lower premiums in the same way it did for auto insurance. If they also remove the individual mandate, that allows people who want insurance to negotiate with insurers for their coverage. It's entirely possible that my husband and I would prefer not to pay for some coverages we don't need. Single men might not want to pay for pregnancy coverage for example.  By the way, I know whole company of people who make less than $80,000 a year. Before the ACA came in, we were paying about $400. My former coworkers now pay about $1000 a month and their deductible is so high, they are essentially paying for all medical care except surgery & broken bones out of pocket.

In other words, no, municipal infrastructure is not fully covered by property taxes.

And licencing/registration could be done online these days rather simply. Those who think it's impractical say so because they don't want to do it. Riders should pay an annual fee that would cover the registration and a reasonable amount to be put towards the maintenance and upgrading of bicycle infrastructure.

Wynne herself is now Ontario's Teresa May; totally blinded by power she's oblivious to how almost universally disliked she is, at least outside of Toronto.

No lawyer, accountant, or other professionals showed their faces, just the female doctors. Believe you me that a tax cut for small business corporations is not a tax cut for working stiffs. A cut in personal taxes might have been a tax cut for the middle class workers provided its benefit could be limited to just them.

Foot-washing at communion is a good example.  We ought to wash one another's feet because Jesus said, """"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.""""  Plain and simple.  Adventists reject the notion that Jesus was primarily speaking in metaphor and we establish a doctrine about foot-washing at communion.  We do the same thing with the Sabbath. It doesn't say the day of worship was changed to Sunday, so we don't keep Sunday, we keep the Seventh-day. Adventists hold to many other doctrinal peculiarities that arise out of our hermenuetic.

Most if not all will be represented by unions, in fact the same ones sponsoring this measure.

0,"We must define Islamophobia by what it truly is. We must also define """"Taqiyya"""". Taqiyya is the Islamic practice of deception for the protection and defence of Islam. Taqiyya translates as """" concealment omission, dissimulation"""" . The Ten Commandments tell Christians and Jew they must not """"bear false witness"""" or to lie. Taqiyya is the Fifth Column of Islam and tells Muslims they may tell infidels like us half truths (omission) and even blame it all on the infidels (concealment) as this writer is doing right now, to defend Islam. Many westerners have a hard time to accept that such a thing is real.  That's why so much about M103 ( and other Liberal policies) makes Canadians of good-will stop and say """"Hey wait a minute """". They can see for themselves the wool is being pulled over their eyes.

0,"Can't disagree more. First, throughout centuries Russia had been a victim of devastating invasions which came from the West. Most recent one was by Nazi Germany. Therefore, Moscow is very sensitive to military activity on the Western borders, as well as to ultra-right ideology (rampant both in Ukraine and some Baltic states). Secondly, """"shock therapy"""" market liberalization, which threw millions of Russians below the poverty line overnight and wiped out savings, was the result of following recommendations of various Western IGOs (IMF, World Bank, etc) and advisers to Yeltsin's admin. Jeffrey Sacks, who served as such an adviser, acknowledged that. That was one of the major reasons for many current social problems. There were internal reasons too, no doubt, but putting all the blame on Russians when they faced devastating externalities of rushed policies (under Western advice and political pressure) is unwise.

0,"To make any tax cuts from becoming budget busters, the sales tax has to go. Also that deduction reduces the motivation  of residents in higher-taxed states to oppose fiscally irresponsible spending in those states--NY, NJ, IL, CT and CA are the worst. And, retaining this tax reduction works against the principal of simplification and a one-page return. But there is a need to reallocate the tax plan to raise the middle-class benefit considerably and that can be done by restoring personal exemptions, lowering tax brackets and other rather simple tweaks to the overall plan.

Certainly reveals Trump's complete lack of understanding concerning how the USA works in the modern era.  At least with Pence we'd have someone who understands things.  Trump understands nothing.

Why is his drinking (or lack thereof) any of the public's business as a news media story? The U.S. news media today remains obsessed with these types of stories, based on gossip that demean others, to make such gossip into """"news."""" If our news media decided to do a story on every major figure in Washington D.C. (as well as in the media) who has ever allegedly had a drinking problem, that would be all that would ever be reported.  The ProPublica report talks about where this man eats, what he drinks, even how he dances (seriously).  Liz Smith used to write a gossip column about celebrities. Now we have DC media writing gossip columns about DC figures. I guess there will always be readers for this stuff, when journalism is struggling in the U.S., where does this take our free press?

0,"Charles, your position, which reflects how cozy the Owner of ADN is with Walker, is not shared by a very large majority of Alaskans. Many of these people live in rural areas and depend on their PFD  to pay for fuel and other essentials. Taking away over half of their PFD in such an arbitrary and nonsensical manner is very unfair. Perhaps you do not care because you do not NEED the money. Many do! And vetoing the distribution does NOTHING to pay for state spending. The veto simply sends the PFD back to the PFD fund. Walker vetoed it as punishment and blackmail of the majority in the legislature. Did he really think the legislature would over ride him? He has now guaranteed that he would not be reelected if he was  stupid enough to try. He might even be facing a recall election. Maybe! Can you tell us why you and ADN are such strong supporters of what many feel is a failed governor. Please tell us what he has accomplished while in office. Not what he has tried to do, but what has done!

Most of all, Trump actually repudiates Christianity. He embraces racism. He sees women as sex objects -- he said that one of the women who accused him of groping was """"too ugly"""" for him to consider doing that. This is apparently a serious response to the accusation. He does not stand for any sort of moral values.  I question the values of the so-called Christian leaders who support Trump. They are actually hurting their own churches.

0,"You state """"Many species of chinook along the West Coast are listed as threatened or endangered due to a host of factors, incl. loss of habitat from urban development, dams, fishing, pollution and competition from non-native fish.""""  Odd that you fail to mention seals/sea lions which eat over 1.4 million pounds of Chinook in Puget Sound annually. More than tribal, recreational, and commercial fishing combined. Since the passage of the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection act, the sea lion's Chinook intake has increased nine fold. The population of these mammals needs to be managed for the continued health of orcas, Chinook, and writers with an agenda to propagate.  The conservation methods enacted in Puget Sound are effective everywhere else. Our sea lion / seal population continues to increase unchecked and protected to the detriment of coastal economy, commercial/recreational fisheries, and the Chinook returns. Much like Columbia dams, Puget Sound needs the ability to cull these mammals.

I agree with most: JVR and Bozak seemed lost. Bozak can't check or give and take a pass; JVR while he has sweet hands, much like Gardiner, can't read plays as they develop.

0,"Transgender individuals require hormone replacement therapy, they require psychiatric care during transition, and if they elect to get surgery it can take 2-4 years for them to recover to the point of being eligible to deploy. On top of that, after the surgery they are at a higher risk of infection for the rest of their life, which complicates any attempt at sending them to the field to train where hygiene isn't always able to be pristinely maintained or overseas. An overseas deployment also puts the individual at risk because they may not have steady access to their hormone replacement drugs, which leads to withdrawal and hormone imbalances as well as health problems. So, just like diabetics and cancer patients and individuals with physical or mental disabilities, it just isn't feasible to accommodate these people so that they can serve.

Fortunately, it isn't up to you to decide who needs what type of firearms.  You are making a lot of assumptions about how many people would have died if he had bolt action rifles instead.  Personally, I have no interest or use for the slide-fire stocks that he used.  I've never seen the fascination with them, and I do agree that they probably shouldn't be legal.  But as to the rifles themselves, there was nothing exceptional or illegal about them (as far as I know from the information released so far - that may change as more information becomes available).

0,"False dichotomy. Smart people don't have only one opinion and think in either/or terms. Smart people see multiple options and rate them. No fossil fuels anymore is the perfect ideal. Also: resources used for local manufacture is far better than resources used for the benefit of foreign manufacturers. So - fossil fuels used locally is is less ideal than pure renewable, but better than fossil fuels used for foreign gain. And fossil fuel used for foreign gain is a net detriment to our country.  Your dichotomy is false, and I believe in making the best of the situation. We can't get to pure renewables in a week (but considering construction times there is no reason we couldn't in 2 years time - if you allow cars to lag a bit).  But even at that optimistic timeline we need ot keep things running for two years.  Either way - we don't actually NEED any more local fossil fuels to do... er ... anything with. We already HAVE more than we should ever burn.

Contrast that with Hickenlooper who, while still a (D), is a right-leaning (D) on many issues.  Same way with Romer, and Lamm.  There's nothing """"right-leaning"""" about Polis.  Further compounding that is the perception issue of being from liberal Boulder, and being part of the highly partisan Congress for the last 8 years.  While that gives him name recognition, it also identifies him as being solidly partisan and anything BUT the type of moderate/centrist that Colorado voters typically look for as governor.

After taking away $700 Million in PFD checks and giving $700 Million to the oil industry I don't think this new idea of gaming the PFD system by the Governor is going to be very popular with the citizenry.

Bullard out of Florida comes to mind as he was considered one of the best run stopping interior lineman in the draft, ranked by some as a late first round talent and was still available when the Broncos picked in the 2nd.  Gotsis was terrible last year, constantly out of position or got caught in traffic and was an easy block.  By the end of the year if Gotsis and Davis were in at the same time, it was probably a 90% chance that it was a run right at them.  Oh well, should've, could've, would've.  Here's to Gotsis proving me wrong.

0,"During the time you describe, health care was a Democratic issue. Republicans collectively chose the negative side, that government should not interfere in medical care. Rare exceptions, like Romney's plan in Massachusetts, helped create Obamacare but there was little other input by Republicans. No republicans voted for Obamacare, and a wave of opponents was elected after.  With that history, it is not surprising that a) some Republicans are still opposed to gov involvement in healthcare, and b) their first contribution didn't get much support. It's only real virtue was that Republicans were actually contributing to the discussion dominated by Democrats for so long.  Trump now has an opportunity to actually fulfill one of his promises! The gridlock in Washington can actually be broken if he brings dems and reps together to work on the issue. 70 years of high school debates can finally end if we get people in Washington to discuss the issue together.

Take the long view. Laws we pass to limit the right to own guns should not be done in reaction to some recent horrible tragedy. Rather, let's start by examining the intent of the 2nd Amendment. The writings of the founding fathers clearly indicate an intent to prevent tyranny. 4. Tyranny doesn't happen overnight. It took two decades for Germany to go from a republic to a fascist state. It happened in small steps. 5. The evil acts of one person do not cancel out the rights of other law-abiding citizens. Otherwise, we should look to restrict access to vehicles, knives, pressure cookers, etc. 6. Firearms are an equalizer and used tens of thousands of times per year to prevent crime, too.

The reason it has failed in its mission is that the State of Hawaii apparatus has a conflict of interest in putting Hawaiian back on the land. The less Hawaiians on the land, the more land swaps and private leases they can do for cronies. With your support, we can phase out DHHL's administration and return the land stewardship to Kanaka - we can do much better in returning ourselves to the 'aina. Benefit to you - less houseless Hawaiians in town.  As far as """"dying race"""", you are racializing this.

Often the families could not take care of the patients and they were in and out of the few beds that exist - only to be let out again and the earliest possible moment.  The community scenario never worked out ... hence so many people on the street .... some people cannot live on their own and need long-term mental health care.

0,"Rsuneet; Since when have doctors not made a VERY good living in this country.  Last time I checked they were not being paid with live chickens or some of mom's home-made soup. A recent family doctor spends several months in any given year travelling the world and materially, lacks absolutely nothing.   It is a tough life, I guess, but somebody has to do it.  Meanwhile, his office is a shambles and his staff are poorly paid.  Sorry, but doctors are a major part of the problem, and except to ask for more money, they and their colleges (unions) have done little to help improve the delivery of medical care, at least in the province of Ontario with which I am most familiar.  Canada has by now a very mediocre medical system by """"first world"""" standards.  Any number of European countries can dance circles around us in quality and timeliness of medical service delivery.  Our doctor's general sense of entitlement and poor ethics contributes to a good portion of this mediocrity.

Every year this number grows by at least 5% or $US 400 billion. At a certain point foreign investors will get tired or worried about too much US$ exposure in their portfolios and will demand higher premiums (which will be a combination of lower US$, higher bonds yields and lower stock prices). Canada's Net International Investment Position, on the other hand, is about zero. The C$ is fundamentally a strong currency.  Moreover, Canada's financial sector is in a phenomenal shape.

For another perspective that generally corroborates the story, the Guardian recently wrote a well-referenced article describing the vast tax fraud that Magnitsky uncovered that stole $230m from the Russian treasury.  The Guardian article links to US court documents that accuse Denis Katsyv and Prevezon of laundering the proceeds of that fraud through various transactions including a Manhattan real estate deal with Jared Kushner.  Natalia Veselnitskaya was a participant in the meeting that took place at Trump Towers with Kushner, Donald Trump Jr, and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.   As the Guardian notes Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon in the money laundering case and is also known as a lobbyist against the Magnitsky sanctions which featured as a subject discussed in that meeting.  Very murky. Robert Mueller has his work cut out!  https://goo.gl/do1URm

0,"I'll explain things to you.....  When the president, who takes an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, calls for cops to be rough with people who at the point of arrest, are still presumed innocent, that's a problem. My best friend of 30 years is a cop, and I certainly get the notion of the adrenaline flowing, and someone getting manhandled in the heat of the moment...but roughing up a suspect shouldn't be verbally encouraged...especially by the president.  As far as Trump's football comments are concerned....I don't, as a fan, like the changes to the game. However, if the choice is between the changes now or the sport being gone within the next 30 years (not the NFL, mind you...THE SPORT), I'll take the changes. It isn't just the hitting that makes football a great sport; it's the 11 guys on the field with a common goal, and working together to achieve that goal.  Trump has never been near a war, and I bet he's never been near a football field, either.

THAT is why morale is low. Same in the military. Great soldiers find their way into elite units and they have high morale alongside fellow studs. Occasionally, sometimes because of soldiers' own choices but mostly because of Army asisgnments, these elite warriors get put into """"regular"""" units. Their morale goes down because they have to work alongside duds who the Army tolerates and won't kick out. Minimalist, get-by, run out the clock people. Eventually these elites either get frustrated and blow up, leave the regulars for another elite unit, or just plain get out. Similar with great teachers. The best leave to work in private schools, a few good ones remain but have friction with duds, management & the union, and fewer still remain and function well with great morale - a minuscule few.

The only factor that seems to affect a media slant is the advertising.  Bottom line, any venture like this must make money to stay in business, therefore more often than not, it is the advertiser's that drive the business.  In reality, I suspect most people want a news outlet that thinks just the way we as individuals think but sorry, that is likely not bias that we are speaking about but conformity to our point of view.  We are all born neutral but pick up certain bias as we grow older and older.  Everyone should believe in something and as for me I now believe it is time for me to have a beer.

You honestly can't believe Trudeau will lead anyone besides his lapdogs in government  to prosperity. The taxpayer will be screwed. I'm assuming you think the imf upgrade is a bonus too. Here's a fun fact we need minimum 3% to keep up. We're the best in g7 means we're a bit brighter than the other 6 dimwits. Like your opinion is a bit better than say another 6 dimwits like rmiller, gadabout, alceste, sphere music , Darcy McGee, and chris from Ottawa.

We all benefit from the knowledge that results when previously censored topics are thoroughly discussed and analyzed.  I'm looking forward to him making good on his promise to have the Supreme Court review Roe vs Wade. In that case the court ruled that the fetus was actually the mothers body. That simply scientific error has directly resulted in the loss of many millions of lives and souls.  The Supreme Court will be forced to recognize that DNA fingerprinting science proves that every fetus is a unique living human individual and as such is guaranteed the same rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as anyone.  If one was to attempt to kill another wanted fetus, to what extreme would the parents be warranted to defend it? All fetuses deserve this protection.  Roe vs Wade did not determine that parents can play God by """"permitting"""" their childrens right to life.

0,"The problem with your """"thesis"""" Zuri, is that the Revolution of 1893 was not an overthrow of a race of people, but a form of government that had become corrupt, illegitimate, and then Liliuokalani attempted to grab more power with a new constitution. As proof, Polynesians, per the Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii, and then under Territorial Government, enjoyed 2/3rds of all the votes, had the highest ethnic representation in the Republic and Territorial Legislature.  The Speaker of the House was a Polynesian, and the first two elected delegates to the U.S. Congress were Polynesians.  First elected was Polynesian Robert Wilcox.  The Prince Kuhio was elected time and again serving as our elected delegate to Congress for 21 years until his tragic heart attack in 1922, always Speaking in favor of full Statehood.

The rest of your post seems so miraculously misinformed, that I must not be understanding you clearly or something. Nixon's Southern Strategy took the South from the Dems, just as LBJ predicted, and the GOP still hold it, largely by playing poor whites against people of color, just as the Jim Crow Democrats did after Reconstruction.  You might be fudging certain key distinctions: """"segregationist voters"""" means nothing after 1968 or so. Southern white voters remain largely anti-civil rights, just as they were during the Crow; it's just that now they vote GOP, like religiously.

Whereas any State legislative extension of the surtax merely enables the County Council to do so by passing an ordinance, the compelling issue in the State legislation is State retention & use of surtax revenue.  The State of Hawaii is one of four USA states only that do not fund public transportation. That means the people & businesses of Oahu (County) are solely responsible for funding public transportation in the state capitol.  Regardless of rail's realities, the State of Hawaii should not be with holding any amount of surtax revenue from the County and should return to the County 100% revenue previously withheld.

The main reasons why the SB was not ready for prime time were that: 1. it was too high and could not clear all the overpasses over roadways; 2.the clearance under the SB was only 2-meters, which was too low for DRIVERS of cars, who braked whenever the SB was passing over them, causing traffic problems; and, 3. the turning mechanisms were not sophisticated enough to handle sharp turns. The concept is good and the shortcomings pointed out are easily remedied by qualified engineers. Overall height would not be a problem because there are no overpasses on the PPP guideway. Clearance height under the SB is not a problem becuase the vehicles SB passes over don't have drivers; and, the turning issues would be easily correct by Google engineers.

One could sit and eat cookies with milk and love her. It was the real beginning.

This is a legal practice used by many wealthy individuals but is it ethical and fair. It certainly is not in case of Prime Ministers who are responsible for the Tax Policy. In effect they have devised a tax policy that requires a higher tax burden for ordinary canadians than they and their wealthy friends bear. It is not an partisan issue as two of the PM's are recent Liberals and one Conservative. It is shameful and disgusting as well a betrayal of hard working Canadians.

Second trimester pregnancies have an annoying habit of not wanting to let go of the placenta after the baby is delivered. I could demonstrate how and why if I had a balloon and silly putty on it to act as the placenta, but that's difficult to play out on an Internet post. Anyway, delay of the placenta after delivery can turn into a catastrophe within minutes because of bleeding. I think blood transfusion capability was a reasonable restriction.

The municipality doesn't have a system and doesn't post alert signs in which case they get some cooperation.  I still can't figure out why, at one intersection, every plow driver piles the now up into a berm so the the bern cuts t one lane nearly in half.  Every other intersection is cleaned but not his one.  With a heavy snow year the street is turned nearly into a one car lane.

After going after less than flattering symbols of American history you, and people like you, are going after 'our' flag and George Washington, who could have been a King, but turned it down. That great man chose to 'serve' and not to be 'served'. He left office more respected than ever and left a shining example for every President since. . One reason sporting events choose to play our National Anthem is a way to show we are ALL Americans and this is just a 'game'.  Football 'players' play. That's what they do and they get paid very well for playing a game. . Being an American means something. Its not just waving a flag. It goes much deeper. In years past,  people wore wrist bands or arm bands to show support or  feelings about a subject. Disrespecting our flag is not an acceptable protest. If you did that just once in N Korea, you'd never be seen again. China and Cuba would, undoubtedly, remove dissenters from 'public view' as well.

So it should be clear to Legislators that Saudi Arabia can flood the oil market with a glut at will and this lowers the price of oil to so Alaskan producers can't make a profit and must slow or stop Alaska's oil production!

Confine all of your doctrinal ridigity to that Council. Before then, lots of things were different, includign homosexuality within the Church. Effective oral contraception has about a 57 year history and so far the Chruch's response has been wrong. Do you when abortion became an issue from conception, rather than quickening? Under Pius IX. Don't blame either Jesus or the Spirit for the hierarchy's misogyy, which first showed itself with clerical continence, which is an insult to the married state.

One reason why this cultural appropriation concept entered the zeitgeist is it hitchhiked on concerns for social justice that are not really in opposition. It's a misreading of the history of colonialism to think of this as plunder. I have not seen any philosophical arguments about identity, history, and how to achieve justice supporting this idea that aren't better accounted for by more cosmopolitan thinkers like Anthony Appiah and Amartya Sen.

Where does she think the funding for her department and therefore the funding for refuse operations come from to begin with.

But that was then and that was before 'free trade' deals and pacts between large international corporations entered for rapid profit and control of people. Trade deals became the means for maximizing profit without regard for the producers/people and even less regard for the  environmental and social repercussions. Greed leaves little time for social justice concerns!  How could this have happened so quickly? One word: governments.

Nothing as the state sells off the housing projects one by one. Nothing when a multibillion dollar train is built high in the air obstructing the view for miles and creating  noise and congestion problems.  Nothing when a private company is putting bicycle racks on public streets and sidewalks and receiving millions in tax payer money to do this.

The Obama administration approved the regulation last year. The rule established a “fiduciary duty” for money managers, requiring them to operate retirement accounts in the best interests of their clients. The Trump team’s repeal will allow financial professionals to steer retirees into expensive or poor-performing products that carry economic benefits and perks for the advisers and their firms, without disclosing such conflicts of interest.""""  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wall-street_us_5894ca9ee4b0c1284f25ce8d?d6b94vs8bnl7q4cxr

It's purely ideological and precludes disinterestedness in negotiating morally graded conundrums. The mark of a fanatic.  Of course I can weigh in on any Catholic issue I like. I'm a cradle Catholic who will always identify as a cultural Catholic. Leaving the church was an unfortunate necessity consistent with my Catholic conscience. So whinge away, I care not.  The criticism that Stein was exploited to burnish the church's public image is hardly eccentric. As you must be aware, Stein's beatification was controversial from the start. Certainly howls of protest erupted from the Jewish community. Since the Nazis were notably dedicated to wiping out European Jewry, their opposition deserves consideration.

0,"The law makes no distinction between problematic and non-problematic cannabis use, but it does discriminate between races and classes.  As the article notes, Canadian teens consume the most cannabis in the industrialized world. Additionally, Canadian teens find cannabis easier to obtain than alcohol, they are about twice as likely to try cannabis than try tobacco and their average age of initiation is 14.  Currently consumers buy cannabis from criminals who sell myriad drugs of unknown potency. purity and provenance, on commission, tax free, to anyone of any age, anytime, anywhere, no questions asked.  If we set the minimum age for cannabis higher than the minimum age for alcohol, it will encourage young people to drink. Alcohol is an order of magnitude more harmful to consumers and abstainers than cannabis.

Fix the social issues (the root of the problem) and you solve the issue in it's entirety. Lets stop blaming guns and start being parents.

You might want to spend some time on this issue - availability of contraceptives; coverage of their costs for low income; etc. is a Women's Issue and a Healthcare issue - duh, it also reduces abortions.  It, imo, is the common good (your stance bends too far to the Fortnight for Freedom wing nuts, Hobby Lobby ridiculousness, etc. Geez, even the Catholic Church understands that almost no catholic follows HV any more - it makes little sense from many human rights angles.

0,"What strong characteristics did Judge Thomas Stewart, Justice John Dimond, and Governor Jay Hammond share? I think some would be dedication to public service, ethics, and honor. It would not have been wise to cross any of these men on these topics. Alaskans are incredibly fortunate to continue benefiting from the work of these 3 men.  Only Governor Hammond's name doesn't adorn a major state building in Juneau. How many of you know who the other two men were? Most current Alaskans either arrived here or wore born past the time of these gentlemen and don't know who they were. But, even newcomers and relatively new borns seem to know what is being said when Jay Hammond's name in invoked in conversation: the person citing his name gets listened to because of the goodness. This is the stuff legends are made of.Nice reputation: wouldn't we all have to have that? Wouldn't we all love to have those we are dealing, share those characteristics? Juneau today is a different kind of place.

O&G company attempted to lease the land to the rancher (according to both) 4.  O&G company built a fence on the land they claim to own 5.  Rancher claims that they own the land by right of adverse possession. 6.  Rancher claims that O&G company workers stampeded cows into a fence (illegally) 7.  BLM ceased to own the land sometime around 30 to 40 years ago and its a crap shoot as to who actually owns the land. 8.

I have no idea if Trump is self-aware of his bigoted behaviours, and the inspiration they provide to the alt-right, or not.  I SUSPECT he is, of a sort, but believes his being president is worth the cost to the American people, as he is so awesome, that the thought of depriving the US people of his leadership is the greater evil.  If he needs to stoke acts of hate, it is merely the cost of his being their great leader.  He will, no doubt, like every problem, solve this, too.  He is awesome, right? This is what makes Trump so dangerous.  His vast over-estimation of himself, and vast under-estimation of the damage he is doing, in achieving, and maintaining, his presidency. Can he be reigned in, before the damn breaks?  So far, it looks very unlikely. America has always loved crisis, real or imagined.

The CPC wants to be a 'big tent' party, an amalgam of libertarians, Red Tories, social conservatives and moderates.

But in a ranked-ballot system, a strong but divisive platform will not win.  This was the undoing of Bernier, the Libertarian, Lemieux, the right-to-lifer, Leitch, the bigot, and even my personal favourite, Chong, the carbon taxer.  If you lead with something that more than 50% dislike you won't win. In 'first past the post', like the US primaries, you risk getting a Donald Trump, who is the preferred choice of the majority of a faction within a political party within a sub-group (those who vote). Strong single-minded visionary leadership is at odds with the ranked ballot, and this may be a disadvantage, but not in a pluralistic, democratic society.

0,"However the exercise of discretion requires a factual basis.  Trump’s policy does not have the factual basis that he claims. The data on terrorism in the United States consistently indicates that the threat largely lies elsewhere.  Judge Robart made that point in his ruling.  Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, has arrived at a striking finding: Nationals of the seven countries singled out by Trump have killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and 2015.   Trump’s action “is a response to a phantom menace.” 3 Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cuban refugees in the 1970s.  Zero by Syrian refugees.  And contrary to Trump's claims Obama did not ban people from the seven listed countries. The Obama administration and Congress had previously designated them as places people couldn’t visit if they planned to participate in the U.S. visa-waiver program - so regular vetting applied - no visa waiver.

The Nixon White House had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people...We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, WE COULD DISRUPT THOSE COMMUNITIES.

Those who choose to ride will ride congregation-free. Those who don't so choose will live with the congestion. Is that so hard to understand? If you're looking for relief from traffic for ALL commuters, you are living in LaLa Land. But let me guess: You do not live along the corridor and therefore will not benefit from rail. So typical of naysayers. So if you want EVERYBODY to miraculously live a traffic-free life, you better get used to EVEN AND ODD highway access similar to Ariyoshi's 1974 gas purchase plan. Because this is the bitter truth: There is NO relief from congestion....NONE. It's what the island has on its hands -- forever. At least give commuters a choice

0,"This is a poorly articulated event-driven assessment of financial markets. Most - if not all - analysts on the street predict a reflationary  trend across the U.S. and with some lag in Europe as well. 10y trailaing P/E ratios the U.S. equities are expensive but nowhere near their pre-crisis peaks. The author should tone down the alarmism and see that the recent Wall Street rally as well as the push-back by some US bank CEOs against a total repeal of Dodd-Frank are strong counter-arguments for her thesis. Not to mention that capital flight from Turkey is in large part unrelated to Trump.  What's more harmful than Trump is when researchers and the press impose cookie-cutter narratives on complicated issues. Sure, alarmism and facile storytelling sell papers. They do not however lead to a better understanding of the markets. Economic alarmism is a rebuttal we all wield in the face of illiberalism, but as seen in the recent US bull-market, it is a weak one.

Now we are asked to believe that he will raise the overnight rate in July, after the CPI inflation rate went from 1.6% in April to 1.3% in May, and the average of the dysfunctional three new core measures that define the operational guide went from an inflation rate of 1.4% in April to 1.3% in May.

He went into politics only late in life, primarily as a stunt to build his brand and as a vanity project. He never bothered with any other service in his whole life, and his faux philanthropy was all wired back to him some how in terms of net gain.  Trudeau (only an average politician, yes) by comparison, with everything he could have done, chose to teach then go into public service. He has taste and education behind him, his wife isn't a third trophy, he takes the high road when it comes to issues, and while he's no great orator (and gaffe prone), at least he doesn't sound like a drunk, high school dropout at a Nascar rally, and he doesn't make every single speech, conversation, interview, and policy announcement about insults and how great he is.

As LBJ stated, with the CRA """"we have lost the South for a generation or more""""....meaning the Southern racists would abandon the Democratic Party.

Logically that argument falls apart or we would have to ban all instruments used in murders as causing murders.  There is no viable way of banning hands and feet.  What that suggests is the PERSON is the only one responsible for making the decision to kill someone else and the tool that they use is entirely incidental to the decision.  We didn't try to ban icepicks or hatchets when they were used in a particularly brutal series of serial murders.  We don't try to ban knives even though they are used in more than 5 times as many deaths as the rifles you are trying to restrict or ban.

Presidents pardon people for political reasons all the time -- Clinton, for example, pardoned a number of very shady characters -- and giving Arpaio a get-out-of-jail-free card is hardly much of a stretch.

As to blame, It's mostly Syrians killing each other, along with hired guns from around the Middle East, mostly armed and supported by Russia, others by Iran or Saudi Arabia, and some by the US along with tactical support. We kill, but the others kill far more, and al-Assad himself kills more than any of the others.  The Nobel Peace Price has more often been an incentive than a reward. Some want the US to pull out of the Middle East entirely, and let those folks duke it out to the finish. Syria is an arena, obviously, with contenders from all over taking advantage of the anarchy and chaos to play out their personal fantasies. In my opinion it's largely a demographic problem.

And THEN, when Japan is reduced to a state of complete military impotency and utterly defeated in every way, and no longer posing a threat to anybody, America drops two nuclear bombs on civilian populations killing well over 100,000, a large majority of which were women, the elderly, and children, and inflicting countless more with generations of cancerous malformations and early cancer death.

0,"One answer to JuJu Bean: if compassion isn't your thing, try self-interest. Providing for the homeless improves quality of life for everybody.  Ask people in downtown Seattle or San Francisco.  They think giving homeless people better options is worth real money, since otherwise they simply congregate and camp in public areas.  Policing them isn't effective (ties up too much manpower).  Pushing them out just moves the problem elsewhere.  And, though it may disappoint you, a Darwinian solution isn't available; we can't let people simply die on our streets.  The first reason housing is so effective is that it disperses a population that otherwise has little choice but to hang out together wherever they are tolerated. The second is that housing gives otherwise hopeless people a motive to start taking better care of themselves.  A third is that housing keep children off the streets and out of cars; even a Darwinian should be able to see the point of saving children.

0,"Well somewhat, of the 216 million some are employed and enjoy private insurance, premiums pay for their healthcare. But depending on the company some with private insurance through an employer pay very little of the premium with the employer contributing most or all. Some employers are just the opposite requiring employees to pay most. Private insurance varies widely between employers also.  How are those differences going to be resolved. Immediately starting on the date single-payer  begins all employers send their contribution to the government rather than the private insurer? All employees also? Or upfront all employers pay a set percent per employee and all employees pay a set percent? This would be great for some and difficult for others.  What about family care? For a two working spouse, family of four, currently the family is covered by a single company private plan. If both companies have to pay into single-payer for each employee, how are the two kids covered?

Regarding slavery,  this was not just an issue, but THE issue of the era, one so big we had to fight a horrible war over it-- and Deady was regarded  as the strongest pro-slavery voice in Oregon. Moreover, he never admitted he had been wrong nor did he ever admit slavery was evil.  He continued his contempt  for those who regarded slavery as a moral issue all his life-- while the report listed two diary entrees, there were actually two others which revealed his lifelong sympathy for slavery. I'd  add that while we should not judge historical figures by """"contemporary values"""" I'd suggest there are universal values and that American slavery grossly violated them.  HOWEVER-- In my view  President Schill is correct in weighing  this decision further, for on- balance, when considering the many admirable qualities Deady displayed, truly this is a tough call on a complex man.

There needs to be some extensive training if you plan to carry a gun in public, a weekend NRA course and a few boxes of ammo at the range won't cut it.  As someone who owns many firearms the first thing I acknowledge is that guns are really dangerous.  The only thing that negates the danger is deeply seated respect for the damage my weapons can do, vigilance against complacency, knowledge of safe handling, and lots of regular practice.  I'd also add that the selection of a firearm for personal defense is less important than the actual practice and training, there's a million good choices for a defensive pistol but the most effective gun in the world is the one you train with.

The chain Fisher volume estimates, which StatCan misleadingly calls chained 2007 dollars estimates, show a lower growth rate at 2.3%; the corresponding inflation rate based on a chain Fisher price index would be 1.5%, since the increase in the value of exports was 3.8%.

But if examined on the basis of total funding per capita to indigenous communities, aboriginal communities receive far, far more than is provided to non-aboriginals. For example, Nunavut (created to be a model of aboriginal self-government) receives per capita annual funding from the federal taxpayers of $42,055 (yes, that's right, a family of four in Nunavut receives annual support of $168,000 from federal taxpayers). That compares to the per-capita funding from the federal government for all Canadians of $1,986. Federal funding for Nunavut per capita is over 20 times greater than the average for all Canadians.

Be in the tools section around noon and you will see the shaking junkies, hands full of small, concealable products, trying to sneak them into their pockets without being seen, then making a dash for the door. Staff can't stop them, 'Security' isn't there, and these junkies on Meth or Heroin will threaten, hit, or push aside anyone that stands between them and their next Fix. APD plays catch-and-release in the parking lot if they get stopped, but they come back the next day. The steal all over town, in sheds, yards, and cars, and nothing is done. The Users AND Pushers need to be held accountable. They WON'T stop themselves.

0,"The day with Trump was going to be a fine balancing act where the ultimate goal was not to push the buttons that would set Trump off.  Mulcair was wrong.  We can stand up for our own values and set an example, as Trudeau has done.  But it wrong to lecture someone like Trump who does not like being lectured to and does not take advice from those who poke him.  It's fine and dandy for Mulcair to suggest that Trudeau lecture and badger Trump on these immigration issues, but what happens to the tens of thousands of jobs dependent on the U.S. market if we anger Trump and he decides to play mean?  Trudeau's approach has been excellent.  Developing relationships beyond Trump with those who matter in his inner circle and key individuals outside of that circle is key and putting certain people in key positions was certainly the right start.  He has done well.  Canada has benefited from Trudeau's foresight on this issue.

The standard groups like SNAP place in abuse cases or cases of corruption is one of rejecting victim blaming. If we should have a presumption of belief for the victims in the case of the Catholic Church Hierarchy, the same should apply in this case as well.  I seriously hope these accusations aren't true.

Instead, North Carolina legislators responded by passing a law that, as ABC News put it, “will ban the state from basing coastal policies on the latest scientific predictions of how much the sea level will rise.” The motive of the maneuver was thinly veiled. Coastal real estate values would plummet if the properties for sale were eroding into the ocean, after all.

Key advocates for the bill included outspoken climate change deniers John Droz and Tom Thompson.""""

Many who stayed home because they could not vote for the Hillary establishment would have voted for Bernie. Same  for many ordinary working folks who eventually voted Trump. But the establishment could not let a democratic socialist become president. Neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party, nor the backroom corporate billionaires who run both parties would allow it. But good for the Germans. They might eventually do the right thing after they've tried everything else. Wars, refugees, identity politics, religious conflicts -these are all distractions from economic bread-and-butter realities. Canadians as welneed to move left.

We have had thousands of years of human history of inventions, highly literate communities/nations, technological advancement, peaceful times, amazing music, and more all without institutional schooling, especially without institutional government-controlled schooling.

0,"If there is a link between anti-GMO and climate change, it is this: GMO's will never feed the world's poor. They can't afford it. Over 80% of farms globally are under 5 acres. They are feeding the world's poor, locally. And they employ people. Mechanized corporate farms, for which pesticide-addicted GMO's are intended, employ one person for every 1000 acres.

And as for the women who claim this is their right, remember that it was female teachers who forced teenage girls to run back into a burning Saudi Arabian school because they were not fully covered. Women can be the biggest oppressors of other women.

0,"Doctors are far less geographically mobile than many other high income earners given the time required to establish a practice and licensing issues. As such, the threat of leaving the country is much less credible than for, say, a higher earning financier or entrepreneur. If the top tax bracket is too high (I think it is), it should be an issue that all high earners grapple with together.  If doctors don't make enough money, argue for a raise rather than side perks like the tax-free accumulation of savings and income sprinkling.  As to the risk involved in being a doctor -- this is fairly low. Demand is insensitive to the economic cycle, the supply of doctors is artificially restricted by the government and we as patients have little transparency into the merits of one doctor vs another  It seems like a stretch to describe many doctors as businesses when they exclusively bill one payer -- the government. Tax regulations normally prohibit people from incorporating when in this situation

Don't live here years then get scared and ask people to feel sorry for you because you are afraid of being deported. Refugees should be here temporarily, under specific rules and set of time, closely monitored as they are guests of our country. After that period of time, they really should be forced to make a hard decision: either be on the path to becoming a U.S. citizen or go somewhere else. For illegals, our tax dollars are being spent on these people in our country, having children, working jobs under the radar and draining our social service programs. If you're here illegally, you're an illegal and I don't feel sorry for you. Other countries work hard to make sure their systems are enforced, there are specific processes to becoming an citizen of their country. Try as an American becoming a citizen of France, Switzerland, Germany or Sweden.

0,"If I wanted to create a doubt among the truthers that US Intelligence spied illegally on the President, I would explain how easy it would be to do it given the tools in the arsenal of the American agencies and their contractors. This release of information by Wikileaks is a speculative one about tools that are already developed and deployed. The attack vectors used are probably commonplace. The payloads may be interesting but they are designed for the IoT which is not a threat pervasive environment for malcode to nest within. News outlets have picked up the reason why threat attribution is so difficult is because footprints can be erased and false information can be inserted which point to a source of convenience, ratcheting the specter that no attack origin can be irrevocably identified contributing migraine-like impairment on the conspiracy minded. There is a difference between a footprint and the signature and the tools and scenarios today and tomorrow. This leak is a red herring.

The latter statement is patently false and that is what I take exception to. Yes the rate of addition of debt becomes almost negligible relative to the size of the economy  and debt servicing remains affordable in an economy that is growing at a healthy rate, even while deficits are being run. I get that and that's essentially what Trudeau and his campaign were saying before the 2015 election and helped him win it. People in the country knew that continuing cuts were not helping anything and were open to deficit spending if ti helped to perk up the economy.

However once they enlist that Gov. aid, their decisions are no longer their own decisions alone, they have given away that right. Now any choices involve other people, whose word carries as much weight as theirs. Sometimes more.  I believe that what people choose, what they do in their private lives, is their decision alone as long as it does not impact others who have no skin in the game.  Carrying a baby is the mothers burden, her body, her life. I wouldn't try to dictate what she should or should not do based on my personal feelings. Not my body, not my baby. It is none of my business at that point.  The day that baby is being cared for in any fashion on taxpayers dimes, it is now all of our business.  Other people do have a say on what an individual will, or will not, do. Parental Rights is now seriously diluted.

Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank didn't issue mortgages themselves in the U.S. - they purchased and then re-sold existing mortgages to further investors without disclosing the poor quality of the original borrowers to the new investors.  From a borrower's perspective, what makes a bad collateralized loan isn't whether the borrower can repay - it is whether the collateral can be sold for enough to make the lender whole in the event that the original borrower defaults.  If someone takes out a loan on their Roles; the pawnbroker doesn't care if they every repay their loan - the pawnbroker just sells the Rolex whenever the original borrower fails to pay.

I never appreciate it when our own money is used to propagandize to us rather than achieve actual results, but now Trudeau's globalists are planning a veritable Orgy of the Vanities.

Councilor Alan Zelenka was the most vocal cheerleader for the rapid demolition; he appears to have a conflict of interest, at least implied: he has close ties to the local purveyors of high-energy efficient technology (read very expensive and somewhat untried).

Also let's not forget, he beat Cam Newton, Andrew luck, Andy Dalton, Phillip Rivers, and Drew Brees at the Saints in 2016: http://www.nfl.com/schedules/2016/REG/BRONCOS Now Trevor will have better playmakers around him with a better system in place. Carlos henderson in college was king of YAC yards: Coming out of college, the Louisiana Tech standout wide receiver wasn’t just better than most, he was better than most by double. Henderson forced missed tackles on a whooping 59% of his receptions. The next closest collegiate player came in at 26%. Beckham Jr. led the NFL last season with 29% forced missed tackles. (continued)

Moon wants judges to be treated like other employees in terms of compensation and retirement, but not in terms of any other laws.  If any other professional falters in their duty, guess what happens?  They can get taken before one of these pampered, protected judges who then passes judgement on them.

Now, consider where we are here in our humble province of Ontario. Our electricity costs are right out of control. Everything government is facing large increases .

I would recruit, tall, strong all around players as much as role playing players.  MG and Kahakai are models from Wahine of old.  That body type is rare.

Sad to think they worked on basics and this is the results.  I'm not surprised they lost. I am not surprised MG and Kahakai are not showing all of their skills that they should have picked up in four and three years.

It appears that the Democrats will be in good shape in November. Trump lost Virginia, and now it seems  that more and more moderate Republicans in Virginia are even abandoning the GOP now, or at least abandoning the extreme right wing of the GOP.  The Dems have gone too far to the left, but there are moderates there also who need encouragement. Maybe the country will someday return to rational debate instead of extremist tirades on both sides. But Trump represents the greatest danger to our country now. More moderate Republican pols might just have to find the moral integrity and the courage to help save us from him.

You are a retired union employee who benefited from a """"union"""" and enjoy a decent retirement.  The school districts in Alaska have legitimate needs that should be addressed.  You would rather shift money to private schools that offer zero disabilities certified teachers and use the public school system for the more expensive services while draining funds from the public school system.  There are many things I disagree with in the ASD. The hiring of a lobbyists ranks in the top five.  I think the public school curriculum should focus more on vocational training and the basics instead of attempting to achieve academic standards for every student based on the premise that the students are all going to college. As an example I'll use the English requirement of American literature and the either world or British literature.  Why?  Isn't one literature class enough?

As a pastor, I do not preach, ever, about anything to do with sexuality, and if approached on such issues by parishioners, I assure them of God's love and that the """"right"""" or """"wrong"""" of anything sexual is a matter of conscience between the individual and God.  I also try to be humble enough to recognize my own shortcomings, and when appropriate, I refer those I counsel to physicians, psychologists, or sex therapists. The bottom line is to let God be God and recognize that our role as clergy is, above all else, to be humble servants of God. We are here to wash feet, not hold feet to fire.

I cannot see them providing for him after the gupta's finally high-tail it for Dubai with the remainder of their loot. I also would not be surprised to find that it is the gupta's who decided to attempt to foist NDZ on us, with their favorite goffer having been instructed to sell this to the two older zuma's.

The simple fact of the matter is that Mr. Nichols has proven himself to be an honest and trustworthy individual. People that are trying to bring up the lawsuit from last year (where the county got a new park out of the settlement) must be forgetting that that was an ongoing issue for 17 years, well before Mark was the County Prosecutor, and had any say so in what his previous boss wanted to do. As for the """"Schoolyard fight""""? It was a matter that was investigated by the FBI as well, and they agreed that it was a simple assault, not a hate crime. I firmly believe that, when it comes down to it, Mr. Nichols will come through this latest attack with flying colors. If he chooses to run again, he can count on my support.

Victimised twice for a victim-less """"crime"""".  This is an unstable environment created by foot dragging on legislation, unclear and often absent federal leadership, unwarranted and suspicious targeting of low risk/ threat shops, local politicians trying to appear in control, and block-headed police going to war with the public under a false and misguided public safety threat.  The problem is police wasting huge amounts of resources to go after small potatoes operating under their noses, when they can put some effort into catching the bad guys. Either gross mismanagement of resources, or petty bullying by an embarrassed police force.

I cannot find any reference to fruits, and I cannot find him saying that his own sexuality is essential for the Eucharist.  I cannot find any such teaching in the Trent definition, or in the CCC, or in the TOB.  In the TOB, Part I is a general theological anthropology that applies to humanity in general, and therefore to all the sacraments.  Part II is the application to the sacrament of marriage, but this does not mean that Part I is not applicable to the other sacraments.  If you really believe, with certainty of faith, that maleness is intrinsic to priesthood, you may be a victim of the vexing conflation of patriarchal sex/gender theory with our current sacramental theology.  Sorry, but I DO NOT believe, with certainty of faith, that Jesus' maleness is essential for the redemption, let alone the priesthood.

Roofs and Parking lots are IDEAL for covering. But, going after the tall buildings, really is not that useful.  Instead, a far better idea is to do 2 things: 1) require that any leased residence,office, building, upon having a tenant turn-over, to convert all of their lights to having at LEAST 65 lumens / watt. For residence indoors, they are not allowed to use hazmat bulbs (i.e. not CFL/fluorescent). Also, this needs to apply to all buildings below 5 stories that change owners (including new owners). 2) require that all new buildings of 5 stories and under to have enough on-site UNSUBSIDIZED AE to equal/exceed the amount of energy used by the HVAC (on a monthly basis). This will encourage builders to build efficient buildings, use geo-thermal HVAC, and then have small amounts of solar. Costs are minor and are recouped.

I had home care services provided to me several months ago and the process was more efficient than I had expected it would be. Mind you, the service was provided for a limited period of time for a specific course of treatment and the home care visits were short. I think the people working within an under-resourced system do their best to try to provide adequate care. But I fear that given the lack of resources the system will collapse under the weight of an aging  population.

Those whose desire it is to deflect from the sexual abuse scandal could be tempted to wish that it were a point of focus, but in my opinion, it doesn't belong in this series, which is probing the experiences of those involved in actual sexual predation and abuse.

0,"The CCCS Adjunct Task Force recommended a 28% pay increase for adjunct faculty. Instead, the CCCS gave to 1,146 full-time faculty a 20% pay increase and an average $4.80/ week increase to the 4,613 adjunct faculty, whose salaries are at poverty level. Meanwhile, over the last seven years, the 13 CCCS college presidents and the 48 vice presidents have seen their salaries increase 30% to 52%. Almost all of them are paid far more than Colo. Gov. John Hickenlooper. Of the 12,590 CCCS employees, 6,831 are non-faculty. The CCCS has raised tuition 149% in the last two decades, has spent more than $392 million recently on building projects, and takes in $20 million more per year than it spends. It spent $132K on lobbyists to make sure  House Bill  14-1154 and  Senate Bill 15-094 were defeated. Both bills advocated faculty equal-pay-for-equal-work. Adjunct faculty are 80% of CCCS faculty. They need a living wage and health care. Their voice is needed to make the CCCS stronger.

When it comes to implements that can kill as fast as a trigger finger can twitch, I believe in erring on the side of caution. ———— Rational reform could begin by requiring Universal Background Checks on all private, as well as licensed, transfer of weapons.

Finland fought the USSR to a standstill in 1940.  Hitler could have been stopped in 1936 when he reoccupied the Rhineland. If the French had invaded the troops were under order to withdraw and the fiasco would have led to his downfall.  This reluctance to act, as in 1939, was because of the defeatist, negative mentality in the UK and France in the 1930s The public in both countries, and most of the politicians, wanted peace at any cost. It was the carnage of WWI that understandably created this mentality.  Stalin cared nothing for his troops. He had the men to keep reinforcing the heavy losses - winter saved him in 1941.

So there are three tiers of subjective opinion beneath that of the court in a sexual assault case. First there's the complainant, then there's the police, and finally there's the prosecutor. Any or all of them could conclude that whatever happened is too minor to bother with. Yet whatever happened will still be recorded as a sexual assault statistic. That statistic is then mentioned by anyone who wants to dramatize the low number of convictions, as a means to coerce new rules around how a criminal trial should be conducted.

Or are they finding their calling elsewhere ... in academia or industry, etc? It seems that the previous two pontificates, which served to scythe down the flowering of the second vatican council, cruelly silencing creative theologians and with them the voice of the Holy Spirit, has led to a clerical culture of mediocrity and self-serving careerism. Pope Francis can only appoint new bishops from among today's priests. How many healthy young men are being attracted to this vocation? How many healthy young women are being denied access to their true calling? Perhaps the pool of excellent candidates is too tiny for the project of resuscitation to be realized?

0,"“Open nominations mean that local communities, local Liberals, get to have the final say on who is actually going to be their candidate,...”  My experience within another political party is that this is not necessarily true.  While local riding associations recruit and nominate party candidates, head office always reserves to right to vet their prospects. No party wants to find its name associated with candidates likely to 'blow up' during an election because of something they wrote years ago in Facebook, or because they are extremist or misogynist etc.  Thus they understandably reserve the right to approve the riding's choice.  This right of approval can also be abused. I've personally seen a serious candidate effectively denied the chance to make their case for nomination before a riding membership by luminaries in head office, who intended their favorite to run in that seat, and used procedural tactics to ensure it.. IMHO the grassroots were cheated.

I also checked in to what it takes to legally immigrate to Canada and it's not so easy. Refugees are a different matter then immigrants.  Maybe if more people understood the difference they would not be so freaked out about refugees coming in versus people who cross the border illegally for economic reasons.  For refugees it's a matter of life or death. For immigrants it's for economic gain.

The church needs people to do many of the functions served by the clergy, and to have those functions done.  By focusing on the priesthood, a clerical caste in emerged in the church.  That caste-like system has a lot to do with the abuse scandal in the church, for it found the bishops judging that it was better for the church to protect priests and especially bishops, even if children were left to suffer.  Tha system has led to a rigidity wherein the church has been utterly unable to adapt to changes in how we view gays, women, even social justice...  It has led to the silencing of theologians who disagree with those in power.  Thus, the church finds itself not only out of step with society (not all that big a deal), but ever less relevant to and effective in the world.

0,"Reply to Doogie23: The infrastructure spending was because of """"green energy"""".  It's faily simple to replace fallen hydro lines.  It's expensive to build new right-of-ways for new transmission lines, new transformer and switching stations to connect turbines.  Only """"some"""" wind turbines are closer than Nanticoke (coal fired station that was shut down), but Nanticoke was already connected to the grid.  The new turbines needed brand new connections and they are spread apart and not a concentrated source of electricity like Nanticoke was.  Green energy is unstable. Wind can suddenly stop blowing and suddenly start - there goes your stability. Gas plants have to be kept on stand by because: 1. green electricity can switch off at any time.  2. they had to replace the peak following capability of Nanticoke.  They replaced fossil fueled coal with fossil fueled natural gas.  Meanwhile the natural gas delivery system leaks methane which is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

0,"Celibacy was done because of the teaching of clerical continence. This the practice of avoiding sexual intercourse before saying Mass which is based on the myth of messianic celibacy. While celibacy is promised (only chastity is avowed), it tends to attract people who are asexuals or seek an asexual ideal because they were born homosexual. St. Paul was likely the former but may have been the latter. Plato made asexuality an ideal in western civilization and we have not recovered since. Augustine may have been asexual, although he had a wife for a time, so he may have conformed to asexuality. He certainly championed its ideals. Aquinas was most obviously an Ace.  To deal with these issues honestly, clerical continence must go. It denigrates women and is based on unproven belief. Married people (including gays) need to be ordained and the ordained allowed to marry or remarry. Asexuals need to be encouraged to accept their rare sexuality and most importantly, ordain women.

0,"I appreciate the efforts to clean things up.  However, I hope that there will be periodic updates on the amount of outstanding bench warrants that are out there and what's being done to address. I do not believe that HPD has a routine coordinated effort to go after those with outstanding warrants(?)  I do not believe that the general public understands that a judge can issue a bench warrant for failure to appear in court  (contempt of court).   This includes outstanding traffic citations.  An individual that I was aware of had failed to appear for a couple of moving violations and a bench warrant was issued.  Unfortunately he was stopped again and was told he had an outstanding bench warrant and ended up spending the 4th of July weekend in the cell block.

Now, according to press reports, it also turns out the loretta lynch gang tried to interfere with his reopening the investigation.  It doesn't take very long to look at a few or even hundreds of emails to see if there is something serious there.  Comey had to do this to protect the integrity of his agency which had already been besmirched by the previous investigation.  But I am going to predict right here and now what the clinton defense is going to be in the next few days.  """"Anthony Weiner is a secret Russian agent.""""  Why not, that was all the defense they had for the wikileaks releases.

0,"""""The Klan instills a depth of hatred that isn't easily discarded. Its followers, to whatever degree, pose grave dangers.""""  This is based on what, the author's imagination?  Apparently so.   Which sociologist did a study on crime statistics and recidivism of Klan members?  Where are the stats on terrorist attacks by Klan members of the last 40 years?   When was the last time you heard of a Klan member attacking someone?  The point is, it's unfounded and grossly unfair to claim that this priest is likely still a Klan member at heart.  So many die in Chicago and it's ignored by Nat Crisis, but an event of 40 years ago signify """"grave dangers.""""   Yeah, I get it.

""""The Donald Trump–Russia dossier is a private intelligence dossier that was written by Christopher Steele, a former British MI6 intelligence officer. It contains unverified allegations of misconduct and collusion between Donald Trump and his campaign and the Russian government during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the period preceding the election. The dossier was produced as part of opposition research during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The research was initially funded by Republicans who did not want Trump to be the Republican Party nominee for president. """"  So what's left to investigate? We already know all this.  What we don't know is whether the contents of the dossier is true, especially the pee-pee tapes. If you're Trump, you don't want to go there.

0,"In our Catholic (and other) biblical scholarship, the various sections of the Bible use all sorts of """"literary forms"""". The Creation stories are written as a """"myth"""" form. Many sections are Legends. Jonah and Job etc. are short stories. Psalms, of course, are poetry.  And, of course, metaphor forms are also used. Some is even intended to record """"history"""" though usually with a """"spiritual"""" slant. Not often """"history"""" as we understand it today.  It seems that the various legends and stories were written down over the course of time, and then were finally collected and re-written in what became """"The Bible"""" Sacred Scrolls during the time of Exile in Babylon. Lacking other identity, the Jewish people became the """"People of The Book"""" remembering their traditions and ancestry.  Good point about learning from the Jewish interpretation and Scholars.  The problems about homoseuality pre-date Humanae Vitae, of course. P. Paul 6 just felt obliged to repeat what what already taught, unfortunately.

0,"If the steele dossier was fake, which is what trump claims, and it was produced by Fusion, also claimed by Hannity, and that allegation that the steele dossier is fake is being used against the democrats as if they have been relying on inaccurate data on trump, why would anyone assume that fusion is on the democrats side? I'm not saying the dossier is fake, fox news seems to be the only people talking about this dossier. I don't recall their being any evidence that the dossier is being used by anyone to prove anything about the gop or trump specifically. There is more than enough evidence to warrant the highest level of scrutiny directed at trump and his staff.

0,"Snarky, I appreciate the effort put into your response + for using scientific sources. It seems 2 links relate to the masters thesis presenting the historical long term super storm frequency hypothesis in 2002 using proxy data from lake sediments. Not being a marine geologist, I do have one observation: In science, one causative effect doesn't necessarily cancel another, both may be operative. Here, an observed but unidentified causative factor seems to influence the long term cycles of super storm activities. That said, scientists have also observed the following(from cliffmass): """" As air warms it can """"hold"""" more water vapor, which can lead to heavier precipitation as the air enters a storm and rises.  In fact, more water vapor can also help rev up a storm as well, since when it condense it releases """"latent"""" heat."""" He agrees a 1 degree C temp increase in water results in a 7% increase in rainfall. He disagrees that the water was warm enough to be significant this time.
