0,"So, the columnist chooses a small, flat, close-knit village in Maine with a population of about a thousand and that is about 98 percent white English-speaking folks going back multiple generations and where the average driveway has two all-wheel drive SUVs with snow tires and chains...  ... he compares that village to a city of almost three million that has one of the most hilly and mountainous terrains of cities in the world, with multiple hundreds of feet of elevation differentials scattered everywhere, where people need buses to commute, and where a great many inhabitants have either nobody living in the house next door or, if there is someone living there, they do not speak the same language.  Hey, awesome comparison there, Mister Columnist. Maybe in your next column you could talk about the mind of a little cockroach in Maine and compare it to your mind there in Vancouver.

0,"Richard,  If you have spare time the best overview of the economic, social and environmental benefits of EV technology that I have seen is available at the link below.  https://ilsr.org/report-electric-vehicles/  Lots of statistics and graphs as well as a discussion of how increased EV adoption would stabilize the grid.

0,"Up until now Trump has been playing with other people's money when making bad decisions resulting in bankruptcies for investors and lenders, losses for suppliers he has screwed and no doubt lost careers for staff he has terminated over the years since he started to climb the greasy pole to the top.  Now his bad decisions will be paid for in human lives.  He is way out of his depth and a danger to the US and the world at large.
"
0,"Now let’s get this straightaway. None of you pay for these expenses out of pocket but you do pay out of pocket for Trump’s continual vacations on his properties and security at Trump Tower.  It costs you and I $1 miilion-a-day for Trump Tower and $400,000 a day every time Trump goes to Florida. Crocodile tears on the Donny Olsen expenses compared to what Trump costs you and me. Quit whining.

1,"It's """"Boipatong"""" and """"apologize."""" But be that as it may, another fine piece of manufactured leftard outrage. But I do have a solution for you: given that you are practically insanely outraged over apartheid (also just 1 p), why don't you sell all your assets and hand over the proceeds to black people, to show us how really, truly,  f...king sorry you are (wth apologies to Monty Python?) This includes, of course, the PC on which you so regularly spew your brain-dead bilge. That way, not only will some apartheid victims benefit, but we will all also be spared from having to read your nonsensical whingeing.

"
0,"Of course Canada's finances are worsening.  We have a completely unqualified PM.  Only the public sector would put an art teacher into a CEO type position.  Both Wynne and Trudeau are qualified to teach advanced finger painting, and both of them have destroyed their economies for years to come.  Not only do they not understand what a balanced budget is, but the Wynne taxes and Trudeau taxes just left everyone with no disposable income anymore, so even more businesses will go bankrupt.  Ah well, how successful would they have been with no light or heat in their offices.  As any smart financial advisor will tell people (or the clowns the Liberals hire for advice), spend your way out of debt, and make sure you spend it on depreciating assets like roads and buses.  And lets not forget about selling income producing assets like Hydro One, or Trudeau's plan of selling Canada's airports.

0,"In the 1950's I believe it was Baltimore Orioles who decided that it was degrading the National Anthem to play before every game.  I find that to be true, forget kneeling, how about those in the stands who do not remove their hats, stands, be quiet, drink beer, it is the same as kneeling.  Hell, the melody for the National Anthem is a drinking song from England that honors womanizing, boozing.

0,"There will be a major wealth redistribution among 1%. During Syria campaign US dropped 26,000 bombs. Global reported that Canadian bombs were around 250,000 -350,000 each. It means US have spent around $7.8 billion on bombs only. Let assume that the person who arrange the war in Syria ( Clinton, Obama ???)  will make a 15% of that, total  $1.17B. What American public got for that ? Nothing, many holes in Syria and possibly thousands ISIS fighters ready to come to US and Europe and do some damage. Lets assume that Trump is more corrupt and he will take 20% of say $10B construction budget. He will make $2B. What American public end up with? Airports, bridges, roads, new hospitals and schools. This is sum of all fears...Lets vote now.... For those who does not know, the war in Iraq cost to taxpayers around 3.8 trillions...
"
0,"I understand what you are saying here (and you forgot Mr. Landry's execrable  music in your list),  but there is also a horizontal aspect of the mass.  While we are, as you say witnesses to our redemption, that, in itself, is not the purpose of the mass.  So, just as you are speaking, in a limited way to one effect of the mass, so too the article's author was speaking, again in a limited way, of another effect of the mass.  Gihr, in The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, p.175 ff. provides a good summary of the fruits and purpose of the mass and neither your's nor the author's effects are mentioned.  Does this mean that neither are to be considered?  I would suggest that the """"both / and"""" approach applies rather than the """"either / or"""". Mass is that place where Earth and Heaven meet, for specific religious purpose, but it does not exclude the fact that both places exist, simultaneously, in one meeting nor that we can receive the grace, in that liturgy, to have our eyes opened in a new way.

0,"Sorry, you're correct, my faux pas... I listened to Ryan's response to McCain's request; apparently it wasn't enough for McCain, but was for Graham and others. The bill should never have been put up for vote. McConnell is either weak or doesn't have control. In any case he should be replaced. There are a lot of citizens in the U.S. who are very sad tonight. The ACA has put the screws to a lot of people and will inhibit the expansion of business. We're one step closer to a European form of government. If the medical device tax goes back into effect in 2018, it will create havoc in the medical device market. By the way, are you surprised that tort reform is not ever discussed? Also, as a result of tonight's vote, do you believe Dems will win seats in the midterms?
"
0,"The problem the Koreans and Chinese have, isn't with the Japanese citizen. It is with their government, which steadfastly refuses to acknowledge or accept responsibility for wartime atrocities (Rape of Nanking, Comfort Women, Unit 731 human experiments). Rather, they are waiting for the surviving victims to die off, and slowly change history by revising their textbooks to slowly (but gradually) wipe out the traces of the evil they committed.  For example, the Nanking Massacre/Rape of Nanking is reduced to a mere """"incident"""", and its (proven) veracity questioned.

"
0,"Globalization agreements in general have so far worked for the benefit of developing countries and the enrichment of capitalists and manufacturers.  These agreements have decimated manufacturing jobs in the US and caused the shrinking of the middle class.  As they stand, it does not look too good for the economic future of the country.  A country that does not produce will eventually go hungry.  New trade agreements should protect our country.
"
0,"It's true that BC was the only province to show a drop in fuel consumption (see Statscan) after the carbon tax was implemented, but I think there are many factors to explain it (cross border purchases when the dollar was at parity) other than the carbon tax.  Even at its current level of $30/tonne it amounts to 6.67 cemts per liter, which isn't enough to dissuade people.  Perhaps if it were $200/tonne it might drive people to look at alternatives.

0,"The book is The Second Church by Ramsay MacMullin and is of interest because it points out just how people on their own, apart from clerical directions, understood and practiced faith. It has a discussion of the archeology of the first known house church, in Dura, present-day Iraq. And a fascinating description of a cathedral built right over the cemetery places where people feasted together with their dead--pouring a bit in wine through an opening in the grave. We (perhaps just I) usually think of house churches as early, but this Second Church, right after the religion became official, offers a glimpse into a quite different landscape of practice. It also makes it easier to understand how people could have listened to Chrysostom's sermons about sex: they didn't, because the only people in his cathedral were upper class, and the elite men had complete license to do what they m might. The bulk of the people just were not there at all. We are all congregational in our beginnings.

"
0,"The Church has never really been a """"monolithic"""" institution.  American RCs may like to think this way, but the Catholic Church has always been a collection of Churches. To suggest that Vatican 2 (because I guess that is what you are referring to), was an effort by anybody to """"sow division"""" shows, to my way of looking at things, an incredible lack of knowledge about the history of Vatican 2. Vatican 2 was not an effort to fundamentally change the Church.  To suggest that it was is to distort historical facts.  And to blame those who tried to update Church structure to help it function better in the modern world for the ills from which the institution suffers is beyond disingenuous.

"
0,"Read all versions of the bill about 3 times.  """"2.  No lease can be longer than 65 years.""""  Absolutely false.  171-36(b) (1) specifically empowers the Board to modify the restrictions in 171-36(a), including 171-36(a)(1) which limits leases to 65 years.  Currently, 171-36(b) specifically allows for extensions or modifications of the lease period, as long as it does “not exceed sixty-five years.” HB1469 CD1 proposes to eliminate that cap, as long as the board approves a development agreement. This empowers the board to give out leases FOREVER, for almost ANY lands, not just for resorts, that supposedly need more than 65 years. This would specifically allow the Board to extend the Mauna Kea lease for another 50, 60, 100 years, binding the hands of Native Hawaiians and the public for multiple generations. Do you know how much can change in that time?  the CD1 would also allow for options for renewal, currently prohibited, which could result in leases longer than 65 years.

0,"Actually your belief might be very wrong.  Accuracy of the shooter improves dramatically with 1 shot per pull of trigger.  Much easier to control the muzzle.  If he would have sighted the AR10s that he owned with a good scope he could have killed a lot more people than he did.  At the same time the sound from the fired gun one at a time might not have been heard as easy.  The rat-a-tat of 50 rounds going off together is easier to hear.  Shooting with a bump stock makes shooting accuracy drop dramatically.  Question - are you as critical of the liquor industry?  People drive drunk and lots of people are killed each year due to alcohol.  My guess more so than with guns when you exclude drug/crime deaths and suicides.

0,"I spent several weeks in Burgundy this summer and met with many  wine producers. I asked if they had tried distributing in Canada. One fellow, who produced exquisite Chardonnays ranging from 15 Euro to 80 in price, said that given the import taxes, the bureaucracy and the divisions from province to province, it just wasn't worth it.  What a shame that more of these wonderful wines can't be found in Canada. On another note, we held a few wine tastings with friends while in Burgundy. One blind tasting was notable for featuring a Puligny Montrachet, a Merseault and a much, much cheaper Rully. The Rully """"won"""" for many of our group. We bought up all the bottles - priced at about 14 Euro (CAD 20) each, at the super market that week and felt very lucky for the experience.

0,"Yes, of course Israel has the right to respond to attacks. What Israel is prohibited from doing by the laws of war is responding in a disproportionate way to any military threat. """"Disproportionate"""" in the context of the laws of war refers to deaths and injuries caused to civilians.  It's clear that the rudimentary rockets from Gaza don't represent a serious threat to the nation of Israel. That means that Israel's military response to those rockets cannot lawfully harm large numbers of civilians. Nevertheless, Israeli military forces will kill over a thousand Gazan civilians in a single assault, over a threat that kills fewer than three Israelis a year. (Israel typically loses 100 times that many citizens to traffic fatalities every year.)

0,"Similar money can either give Scarborough: - 1 rapid-transit stop at STC, running underground separate from traffic, or - 24 rapid-transit stops spanning central/southwest/southeast Scarborough, running separate from traffic with signal priority.  It's clear which option brings more rapid transit to more neighbourhoods. And the STC subway's time savings evaporate when you include time wasted on the longer bus ride *to* rapid transit: the STC-Kennedy ride will be 8 minutes shorter, but riders will waste an average 6.8 minutes more on buses.  So we're spending $3.5 BILLION and counting to save 2,300 additional daily riders a single minute each.  Also, LRT greatly speeds up local trips (½ of Scarb. rides); that 6 km spent underground doesn't.  And you're questioning why those who champion the best use of transit funds to serve the most Scarborough residents want so desperately to bring more rapid transit to more Scarborough neighbourhoods and residents. *shaking head*

0,"So Trump spent the campaign and most of his days since the election criticizing China and Mexico for unfair trade practices and then his first trade hits are against Canada. He's conveniently picked long standing differences of opinion between us too - there really isn't anything very new in the debate.  When he came into office his first phone calls were to Taiwan, Pakistan and Nick Fage, not China, India or the EU. Then he meets Trudeau. The meeting goes swimmingly well. He'll tweak our relationship. Well, welcome to the tweak. It's disruption, Trumpism, at its best.  If there weren't so many livelihoods in the balance, I would bet if we rolled over on these issues he'd move on with victory in his sails for free and fair trade. Kicking Canada is mostly optics, he's sending a signal to everyone. """"I do this to my friends folks, imagine what it's going to be like when I turn my attention to you.""""  It's a negotiation tactic, it's a bully tactic, and it often works. Just read his book.

I truly hope that smaller retailers take the lead in offering a minimum $15.00/hr to their staff thanks in part to the lowering of CC fees. I know some people will expect retail prices to drop due to this HUGE reduction but most of us are trying to be good employers and continue to pay our bills and this will help us do that. People should patronize good retailers and good service providers. Thanks CFIB!

For if you did, you would realize that the questions I pose are real world problems with these panels. Try to answer them yourself, or do the research. These issues generally are not elaborated upon at a site that is invested in promoting solar panels, such as the one you reference here.

0,"""""It would result in more choices better quality and prices.""""  Not necessarily. What it will necessarily bring is an inability to control production, as is presently the case with grain, beef, pork, fruits & vegetables, etc. When prices are good, producers understandably want to increase production. When others (understandably) do the same, we have overproduction, price collapse, farmers who can't pay bills and bankruptcies for farmers and sometimes even creditors like local feed stores.  That could lead to a supply shortage (fewer choices), increased imports (often lower quality) and higher prices.  Food security is something we take for granted. Some day something will cross our path to remind us that a nation's food supply is really a matter of national security..

Imagine our surprise when we discovered he was right! (though some here still deny it) And after all, Saddam was our ally, and had no involvement in the 9/11 attacks.

0,"Patrick, As a defined benefit cop you are aware that cops in the last 3 years of their 20 year hitch required for retirement game the overtime. By that I mean overtime is awarded by seniority so having seniority in the last 3 years before retirement they work any and all the overtime they can. The amount of their retirement is based on 50% of their high 3 years averaged. With all that overtime they can double or very significantly increase the amount of their retirement checks. So say a cop goes to the academy at age 21. Then games the overtime the last 3 of 20 years. Now he can retire with conceivably $10,000.00 per month plus free medical for his family for life. He starts collecting at age 41. And you claim it costs the taxpayer no more for a newbie cop that has no pension at all. Somewhat disingenuous of you Patrick. But I know you will say the state did it to the newbies. Greed made it easy for the state to bust the public sector unions. To bad for the newbies huh Patrick.

A museum in Providence Rhode Island owned the artifact since 1810. Hui Malama claimed the museum never properly owned it, and that it was a religious object invested with the spirit of a warrior and still worshipped by ethnic Hawaiians. The NAGPRA law was invoked by Hui Malama to prevent the sale, and to force repatriation back to Hawai'i. The City of Providence filed a lawsuit against NAGPRA and Hui Malama and others, claiming that the artifact was merely a utilitarian object which the museum properly owned, and that the forced repatriation would constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property without fair compensation.

That is where real leadership resides - right in the story, in front, visible, giving hope, inspiring.

They demonstrated--through the ruling of Imam al-Khomeini (may Allah be pleased with him) their adherence to said rulings by REFUSING to respond in kind against Ba'athist Iraq when they used chemical WMD's which murdered nearly a million of their citizens.  The Zionist entity has, on the other hand, REPEATEDLY threatened their neighbors, the capitals of Europe, the Russians and by extension the WORLD with nuclear winter since at least 1973.

0,"Employees using paychecks, which become their property when issued, to buy pork or porn is a different matter than an employer being required to buy insurance that covers medications, devices or procedures that the employer finds to be against his moral or religious convictions. In effect the employer is buying the birth control pills or IUD through the mechanism of paying premiums to a third party, not the employee, on an insurance policy that will be used to directly purchase those items.  Employers were told by administrative directive that they have to purchase something that pays for meds or devices that they find objectionable. It is not in the ACA; therefore changing the directive is within the bounds of the law, by design. The lawsuits over this are similar to lawsuits on DACA - telling the executive branch they must do something no law says they have to do - a very odd thing to sue over.

What a lot of families are cheesed about is the fact that in a regular hospital they are usually not charged a per diem fee. In a Long-Term Care home, however, residents are charged. One way to deal with this problem is that absolutely everyone who is deemed ALC should be required to pay the per diem fee. Not $1100 per day - which may be what the daily rate is at that particular hospital (i.e., someone without OHIP would be charged this amount). The son needs to suck it up and either pay for 24 hour care for his dad or pay the per diem.

In the show the media blamed refugees in a camp for a crime spree and murder that took place and there was a period where racism and violence resulted in large part from the media coverage of the events. The acting was very good and the story line was quite credible given recent events.  Perhaps President Trump watched the show last night and didn't realize it was just a TV drama.

There's no shortage of workers. Only a shortage of employers willing to pay what they must to attract and retain the workers they need.

Yes, it's true, the state and local chambers of commerce does not support an income tax. So we have two choices, one protects a business that derives it income from free money-grants, and the other relies on spending by employed individuals. Which by the way there are over 6 thousand fewer private sector employees spending money in Alaska, while there has not been a single state or local f/t employee, furloughed or laid-of; yes, the state has cut unfilled and vacant positions.

He was factually acquitted. You might also note that 100% of the Democratic Senators voted not guilty while both guilty and not guilty verdicts were rendered by Republican Senators.

That intersection is definitely not designed with the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists in mind. Lanes and crossing distances are far too wide. Right turn on red after stopping at intersections was a rule invented on the West Coast to move traffic in low traffic conditions. As our cities and intersections see increasing traffic, we need to consider making them safer by banning right turn on red in certain areas. Most cities on the East Coast have no right on red by default. Obviously Issaquah is not the village it once was, and road design needs to keep up.

You contact them using a person from their realm of money and power.     An ex-President qualifies.  The Clinton foundation is pragmatic, they ask for donations from those who have the most descretionary wealth in the world.   If you want money, go to those who hold it.

And I suspect that when mueller goes after trump for treason, I suspect that either pence or ryan will pardon trump before a full conviction can occur. And yes, T will be gone before Xmas. The real question will be, who will replace him. If they go for treason, then Pence will be included, RIGHTLY and ryan will be president. If they go for obstruction, which I think is VERY likely, then pence will be president. Regardless, both will pardon at least T so as to avoid their party looking as bad as it is.

Population increase might be a primary driver of housing prices, but a lack of supply relative to the demand is the major other part of the equation, and there is way too much push-back against residential density in inner Portland neighborhoods (ironically by many people who also claim to be saddened by the lack of affordability for their fellow citizens).

I know people who left Eugene and moved to Springfield because nice housing and utilities (we have SUB not EWEB) are affordable.  We support our public safety services, our schools are good,  and, we have a good school board that works at improving education for all children of all economic means.  I lived in Eugene for several years and moved back to Springfield about twenty years ago, I haven't regretted that decision.  I got tired of Eugene's mayor and city councilors always being at odds with themselves and their constituents, this was before Kitty Piercy and the current council when Eugene had a Republican mayor, nothing changes in Eugene governance even when you change political parties in lead roles.  I like Springfield and foresee a positive growth forward for its populace.

How many didn't pursue it because it involves heavy doses of math and physics. That stuff is really hard. The truth is, the big companies - Google and friends - have actually opened offices in Canadian university towns just to snap up the graduating talent. There just isn't enough in certain fields.  And there's a difference between the skills required for start-ups vs. established companies. Start-ups can't afford to train and nurture. They need people with experience to get them moving on the right track. Hence the worldwide search for senior level talent.

A friend of mine who thought he had Lyme asked his doctor about Sleep Apnea and the doctor said to him """"Oh you don't look like you have Sleep Apnea"""" which is like saying """"Oh you don't look like you have Type O Blood.""""

Erdogan's policies reflect a belief that Turkey is the Middle East's premier regional power and, as a result, he has antagonized both the Arabs and the Europeans with his actions.  On multiple occasions, Erdogan has criticized the 1920 Treaty of Lausanne for leaving the country too small.  Turkey’s pro-government media regularly displays maps of Turkey with borders as they existed in October 1918. The maps reflect Turkey's territorial claims as defined in a document known as the National Pact. They include the Greek Aegean islands and a southern border from north of Aleppo in Syria to Kirkuk in Iraq.  In fact, Erdogan has suggested the Iraqi Primer Minister read it in order to understand Turkey's policy in Iraq and Syria. His actions in those countries suggest he's not bluffing.  I don't see the US or any other nation in the area supporting that type of agenda.  In fact, the Kurds seem to be the only people who can thwart Erdogan's regional ambitions.

(Ironically, the Orthodox Church, like the CC, doesn't even recognize Anglican orders, yet they complain, especially Russian Orthodox.) And Francis seems far more receptive to Anglican gay bishop/priest couples than the Orthodox since he commissioned pairs of  male Anglican and Catholic bishops to work and pray together in their home countries (though, as I said, there were no pairs of women bishops, gay or straight, commissioned). Anyway, ecumenism is in the ice age as far as I can tell, even with Francis' good will gestures.

We have evolved and succeeded without being subsumed by the most powerful country the world has ever seen next door and maintained our distinctive, respected place in the world. Much of this may be attributed to the sense of this country's founders, imperfect though they were. Schools named after Sir John may offend some who see our history as a slight and wish to sanitise the past as part of the penance they believe is due, but their view is mostly bunk to be rejected by those who recognise that righting past wrongs does not mean throwing the baby out with the bath water. Canadians of all stripes are generally fair minded and not given to extremes, which is why the proposal of this clique should fall on deaf ears.

Most of Anchorage's mental health facilities are at peak occupancy so unfortunately it is very difficult for all but the worst mental cases to end up admitted. I do not know if this was the case for the shooter or if he was truly found to be mentally stable.  Since the shooter was not deemed mentally unfit the FBI could not legally withhold his gun but for a short period of time.  The law is very lax regarding mental fitness and possession of firearms.  To me his domestic violence record coupled with his visit to the FBI should have been enough to remove his weapons for a much longer period of time.

Scientific evidence:  “Over the course of a full lunar day the temperature on the Moon can vary from around +390 to -320 degrees Fahrenheit.”  (NASA)  Without a “greenhouse” shield the Earth also would freeze at night and burn up during the day.

0,"The Age of Nuclear Waste is becoming a profit-making adventure at taxpayer's expense. Over a billion dollars has been spent retrieving and consolidating a $10 billion legacy of radioactive waste at Chalk River, Ontario. And now a consortium of multinational corporations, put in charge of Chalk River by the Harper government, wants to build a five-story mound of radioactive debris right beside the Ottawa River. The proposal seems motivated by cost-cutting and profit-taking rather than keeping radioactive poisons out of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat, for generations to come. The waste will be abandoned permanently, although some materials contained therein, including plutonium, remain dangerous for millennia. There is a policy vacuum -- no legislation exists governing the long term management of post-fission nuclear wastes except for used fuel.  Canadians should demand public consultations to lay down principles to protect public safety. Until then, desist.

In Professor Küng's case, he had already been canned, years before he published the criticism you refer to. (Although he wasn't exactly reticent with his criticism in his youth either.)  Professor Küng was retired from the faculty of Ecumenical Theology of the University of Tübingen. Criticizing churches is part of Ecumenical Theology. Weinandy was employed by the Catholic Church as a doctrinal purity inspector. Retired professors can't be fired; their pensions are paid by secular taxes. Speaking freely on controversial subjects is one of the things they are expected to do.  Weinandy is a member of a religious order. Küng is a diocesan priest in a diocese (Lucerne) which has a long-standing reputation for independence from Rome. It is not likely Küng's bishop had any objection to his letter.

I am surprised that the Speaker, Ryan, didn't ask for a unanimous declaration that the convention was for Trump. Donley was correct in demanding a recount, And the lawyers were right to declare all votes for Trump. Cruz's speech proved that he is not a team player and did not deserve any Alaska votes or any other state's votes either. He was part of the 17 that insisted that Trump sign a pledge to support the eventual nominee. Cruz signed that pledge and then refuses to honor it since Trump was the nominee. This shows that Cruz is not worthy and is not honorable to ever become a serious candidate for President in the future. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

If you catch your shoplifter all the police can do is write them a ticket.  secondly people usually cannot be held without bail for fairness purposes.  thirdly the girl who ran over the man committed nothing more than manslaughter and she had money.  Anyone in this country can (buy) their freedom in any state; as long as theyre influential enough.  the guy who ran over the 2 teen girls because he was drunk driving, still locked up and will be for another couple decades if not permanently.  Other killers convicted have also been sentenced to life and double life sentences with no chance for parole.  I agree with another poster perhaps you should actually ATTEND a few of these court cases.  Ive sat in on several cases and most """"violent"""" offenders do not end up back on the street, especially not people who have murdered someone.

0,"Gerald Capplan's criticism of Conservative Party of Canada seems somewhat shallow and meaningless considering the shape his party (NDP) finds itself. It's clear that Canadians as a whole have more confidence in the CPC despite the tragic choice of strategy at the mid-point in the election. The NDP have suffered a far great insult than the CPC. In fact the NDP is arguably running down the Leap Manifesto rabbit whole in - what one can only describe - as marijuana inspired environmental extreme left-wing Cumbaya. In fact Gerald Capplan should be more worried about the NPD's lack of ability to find an effective interim leadership candidate to replace the lame duck leader that is Thomas Mulcair. And this is not criticism of Tom's ability as a parliamentarian. In fact, it's arguable Thomas Mulcaire was probably one of the most effective parliamentarians when he was the official opposition. Clearly though - Canadians did not feel that the NDP's platform was the direction they wanted to go.

And Trump has agreed to increase military support for the Saudi's in their two year old war in Yemen-- the support requested by Prince Mohamed during his visit to the Whitehouse three weeks ago. He has spoken out against Iran.

Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon.

0,"My wife works on a barely-above-minimum wage.  A lot of debate around minimum wage ignore the other aspect of minimum-wage economy altogether: hours worked and hours commuted. Point is, businesses often respond to minimum wage increases by replacing full-time workers with part-time ones. Even worse, since businesses that employ minimum wage workers in the first place typically belong to the same industry, this means that entire industries reduce hours of their """"least valued"""" employees, which means that in practice employees have to accept this new schedule, because they have no choice. And, yes, it often means worse service for customers - who also accept it because there is no choice.  But even worse is the fact is that under this new minimum wage employees still need to commute the same amount of time, which creates a situation that for every paid hour you can spend another hour in a commute, which effectively halves your pay per hours spend on work. So everyone loses.

People still die from cirrhosis and drunk driving and ruin their lives and the lives of others.  It shows a staggering lack of acceptance of how addiction works to say that if opiates were legal somehow the problem would be solved, when all data about cigarettes and alcohol show otherwise. The cheaper and easier cigarettes are to get, the more places people can smoke them, the more likely they are to smoke, smoke more and die from smoking related illness. Same with alcohol.  Look these people are addicts. It's a highly addictive substance, that has a genetic competent to how individuals react to it that requires higher and higher doses over time to even maintain withdraw. The more accessible it is, the cheaper it is, the easier it is to take, the more people will become addicted and the more people will die.  Simple.

0,"Emmett, I think you are missing the slow but inexorable movement of Francis to implement in practice the collegiality of V2.  Think about it for a moment. If Francis or any pope were to use the universal jurisdiction granted the pope by V1 to impose a V2 collegial structure motu proprio, the act itself would belie the intent.  Francis, in stark contract to his post-V2 predecessors, formally invited the bishops at the two synods on the family to freely speak their minds, and they bloody well did. When it turned out that Francis did not get the 2/3 majority he required to implement his desired merciful revision of the law concerning remarriage, he dutifully wrote a document that reiterated the status quo, except for essentially a footnote reaffirming the internal forum process as a way out.  He did not impose his will. He allows himself to be constrained by the failed 2/3 majority (that is, even though more than 50% voted for change, he did not impose it.)

0,". They are crashes not accidents. Crashes are the result of operator errors. Like guns it is the operator not the vehicle that is the problem. When someone is killed or injured in car crash, most people respond with oh that is a shame. But if a gun is involved it's a whole different kind of reaction. Why? Car crashes kill around 40,000 people each year injure more than 600,000 and unless the killed or injured is someone we know it's usually a shrug and a thought glad it's not someone I know. If the gun control crowd spent as much time vaporing about unsafe drivers as about guns that would make much better sense. Not everyone should be allowed to drive. Every driver and passenger should be required to watch a video of  car crashes at least once a year just to remind people that speed limits and red lights require thought and action from drivers and passengers. Neither cars nor guns kill it's a people problem. If you have doubts watch traffic at W11th and Belt line. It's the drivers!!!!!

0,"Scott, very informative article.  It shows the difficulty in futures trading.  You need to get both the direction and the timing correct.  It looks to me that if the price is currently being driven by the futures market as you indicate, than this means that we should eventually see the price of oil increase to reflect supply/demand balance.  The investment in production has been much lower the past 2 years as the price of oil has been declining.  Eventually this will have a large impact on world production and with demand on a steady but slow upward climb, inventories will drop.  I see US shale being able to fill some of this void with fairly quick turnaround, but it won't be able to make up all production that is being lost, especially in those long time frame and expensive deep water wells.  This seems to me like a good opportunity to pick up some solid low cost, well financed producers that have seen stock prices driven down due to concern about the recent drop in oil prices.

0,"I agree, for the most part, with your stance in regard to pesticides, although properly applied, many are beneficial; some are, in fact, naturally-occurring in soil microbes. The problem arises when people who don't know what they're doing apply them improperly, ignorantly assuming that if a little is good, more is better. This is something that we've seen time and again with illegal marijuana grow-ops in the forests of the Emerald Triangle, for example, with the result that ecosystems are trashed with pesticides and rodenticides, thus contaminating waters and soils.  As for GMO labeling, I'm not exactly certain that we can trust government-approved labels (e.g., """"all natural!"""") - nobody even knows what that actually means, so there's a problem right there. As well, I find that companies are increasingly eager to label their products in order to increase consumer appeal; thus we find breads, for example, bearing a label touting that they're made with no high-fructose corn syrup.

0,"President Lincoln was very good with words, but it was he who started the violent uncivil and unconstitutional war against the South by calling up 75,000 armed men to invade the South which has seceded without any constitutional prohibition.  He started the first draft, obligating northerners to suffer and die as they fought against southern brothers.  Over 630,000 Americans died in that war that he started, more than all other US wars combined.  The total by today's proportion, 10 times the 31.4 million of 1861, would be over 6.3 million, and that is without counting the hundreds of thousands of wounded physically and psychologically as well as the hundreds of thousands or million or more of widows and orphans.  Lincoln was eloquent about his own suffering, but did he ever understand and repent of the horror, death, and destruction he brought about?

To say that anthropocentrism is... embedded in many modern human cultures seems self-explanatory... I can't think of a culture, present or past, that was not anthropocentric.  The reason is likely that, alone among the animals, man is capable of significantly greater acts of intellect and will - man is self-reflective in ways that other creatures, except perhaps the angelic, cannot be. cont.

0,"severe lack of fathers in modern society which is the number one reason women abort (Lack of familial/ spousal support )  That is exactly why women should be encouraged to use birth control when having sex with a man who may not stick around. It would prevent pregnancy in the first place. Only when she knows that her mate will stick around and support her that it is OK to become pregnant.  As for promiscuity, well, humans have been promiscuous for millions of years because it is in our genes that we have sex as often as we can in order to produce offsprings. That is why sex is very pleasurable - to encourage us to do it often. Sure, many people have the self-control to resist their desire for the pleasure but there are many who give in to it or are in danger of rape so they should have access to birth control just in case.

As far as NG goes, as I said, the science on neither your claim nor mine is  definitive.  One reason for this might be because monitoring the leaks requires the cooperation of NG producers who have every reason NOT to cooperate.

0,"I don't know about the balls being manipulated and if that has an impact.  One change I do note is that there are dozens and dozens of guys who throw 90+ and many 95+.  When Nolan Ryan was in his prime, he threw maybe 95 on occasion but was probably closer to lower 90s and he was an aberration.   Today, average everyday middle relievers throw 95+.  It's crazy.  If a hitter just connects with one of those, that ball is going a long distance.  What caused the outburst of HRs last night, I believe, was the pitchers being gassed.  The 2-3-2 setup along with the starters not lasting long caused overuse through the series of the relievers.  A 2-2-1-1-1 style would probably result in much fewer HRs.

That was a rare combination of talent at the direction of a very special QB.  Trevor (like most mortal QBs) will need a solid running game to take the pressure off of the passing game in order to be successful.  If the running game shines, Trevor and the passing game will probably be able to shine.  But if the running game struggles again, defenses are going to be all over Trevor (again).

Bullies don't back down when they're encouraged to go on bullying. The only proper way to handle situations where neo-Nazis and Antifa go head to head is to denounce BOTH of them for their violence.  The citizen journalist deserves some kudos, but he needs to be even handed in his coverage. It's not """"we can ignore the violence of this side because they have the right ideas."""" No, we can't! Both sides are wrong and both sides need to be condemned.  When whites or conservatives are violent toward blacks or leftist extremists like Antifa, they should also be condemned.

By doing so we allow some very wealthy families to continue to operate their businesses as if they were still the 100% shareholder and risk taker and this clearly does not benefit anybody except these families. The rest of us, if we invest in theses companies (either directly or through our pension plans and mutual funds) are simply being taken advantage of. The families can continue their own agendas with other people's money and this is not in the interests of the shareholders or the employees.

Tribes have the resources to work best  in finding relative or tribal homes. Many tribes have very good to excellent  social services available as well. They are over looked or ignored at times by some OCS case workers/offices for purely internal political reasons.

I did find this, though, from Consumer Reports:  http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/06/booking-a-hotel-these-cities-have-the-highest-hotel-taxes/index.htm  By that guard, Hawaii does not stand out one way or the other.  I suspect many people commenting here do so based on their pre-existing disposition for or against taxes, for or against government.

0,"Hmm, maybe, but not in Western Canada, where the reverse is true, these days.  Last week, home-grown Parmount Resources and Cardinal Energy snatched up deeds to a billion bucks worth of assets from U.S. company, Apache.  Others: Cenovus Energy picked up Conoco-Phillips assets and Canadian Natural Resources is poised to take Dutch Shell operations. We're talking BILLIONS on each deal.  In other news: """"Canada already leads in terms of doing deals in the crucial U.S. market. According to law firm Paul Weiss, Canadian companies and funds have completed more than $93-billion in U.S. mergers and acquisitions over the past 12 months, putting them ahead of both German and Chinese acquirers.""""  That whooshing sound? Canadian corps grabbing up the deals.  Reason is simple according to Mark Jamrozinski, Deloitte LLP: “When you’re struggling to generate growth internally, you have to go out and buy it.” (G&M Sept. 2017)  Puts the whine, """"selling off Canada,"""" into perspective, eh?

0,"The bond rating agencies would be the judge of whether the provincial finances are okay or not.  So far they have given good marks to the BC government.  BC has a good credit rating.  If John Horgan and the BC NDP were to run large deficits then the BC government could face a credit downgrade and end up having to pay more interest on their bonds.  If that happened then everyone in BC would have to pay more taxes just to pay the interest on the BC government bonds.  Increased bond issuance from having deficits every year along with having to pay higher interest rates due to a credit downgrade would mean more and more tax revenue would go just to paying interest on the provincial debt instead of going to pay for government programs and services.  So I would rather have Christy Clark win the election and continue to run balanced budgets instead of taking a chance on John Horgan and the NDP.  I don't believe the NDP platform can be put into effect without producing large deficits.

0,"Why, when the Rockies finally are having a great season do they have to be stuck in the division with 3 of the 4 best teams in baseball? I dread the idea of them having a 98 win season, but missing out on winning the division and a 162 game season coming down to ONE wild card game - despite very possibly having the 3rd best record in MLB. The Rockies lack the ace pitcher that either the D-Backs or Dodgers can trot out for a one game elimination. I hated the new wild card format when baseball announced it and hate it even more now. What we will end up with is the winner of the garbage central divisions making the division round of the playoffs while two far superior wild card teams will be eliminated. All pro sports should drop the division standings and just seed the top teams.

Career success will always provide the rewards of status and comfort, so people are naturally motivated to aspire to those things. In my opinion, indolence and laziness are more products of economic and social hopelessness than personal failings. Let the market provide it's own incentives to those who work hard, but provide a social security net that encourages people to actively participate in the system. A final note, IMO the greatest shortcoming with limited welfare schemes is the cut-off point - if people do better they lose their social security, encouraging them to stay out of the labour market in any meaningful sense. The right UBI scheme supplements other income to guarantee security while rewarding effort.

There were 155,000 people employed in mining and oil and gas in Alberta alone in 2015. Average wage was $41 per hr which is approximately $85k per year.  155,000 x 85,000 = $13.175 BILLION

One thing for sure...flipping the bird casually can be life- threatening (e.g., roadways) and definitely not life-saving.

0,"This bill will strengthen existing laws about stream/waterway maintenance. Some of our flood problems in the Manoa-Makiki and Ala Wai Canal area generally are due to a severe lack of stream maintenance. Most of Manoa stream and much of Palolo Stream is privately owned, and residents vary in their stream-care giving efforts. And stream maintenance in the state owned lands upstream of the urban areas is poor also. Poor maintenance is seen during heavy rains when trees and branches are swept downstream and block bridges. But, council members may not be aware that the City is not inspecting private stream properties to check the maintenance situation. Getting inspections of private streams should be on the Council's agenda. No inspections means no enforcement means continued flood and pollution problems. Just passing another bill really does not address the root problem which is no inspections and no enforcement of existing laws.

If I may add further, that once a potential refugee enters illegally, Canada then extends financial support whilst they are waiting for the results of their application, and the results of any subsequent appeals.  Financial support, plus free medical, and free schooling.  Should an applicant give birth in Canada, this may bolster their claims to refugee status, or give them an avenue for legal immigration in the future as a sponsored immigrant.  Not only are these advantages not extended to applicants outside of Canada, who follow the legal process, these advantages are so great that it could compel many more potential refugees to skip trying to enter Canada legally.  Our system is not just being undercut, we are enabling a collapse of our refugee system.

Clinton received much more detailed information and did nothing about that. Aircraft hijacking was offered as a possible way for Bin Ladin to conduct an attack, among other ways as well. Yes, I did comment about 9/11 first in my comments to you but not the first to bring up Bush in his comments section. No, you did not finish it. You are sounding a bit frustrated? Tired of facts making you look foolish? I am sorry about that but you seem to step in it a lot.

The Klein's actual reason was because their Christian beliefs require them to have nothing to do with promoting homosexual behavior, and they believed doing so could risk their immortal souls as well as the souls of the homosexual couple.  This is a protected First Amendment right. Any laws the State of Oregon may have that deny this right should be deemed unconstitutional. Whether our Supreme Court will do so without Justice Scalia remains to be seen.  Either way, the Kleins will choose their immortal souls and those of the gays over their business interests every time, guaranteed.

Those earning the median should be taxed about what they’re taxed now, 15% on income above $14k, or $2.6k on someone who earns the median. Then, increase the marginal rate by 7% for every multiple of the median income, so someone earning $217k would be paying 64% on any income above that.

0,"I wonder if anyone has noticed how things have turned around in this country when it comes to the issue of racism. Allegations become fact and the assumption is you are guilty until you can prove you are innocent. Even then the accusation will stick, as there will be widespread belief among those who believe the accusations that if a person or person is not found guilty, it is because of their lawyer or a cover-up. Perhaps the assumption here on the part of the accusers and their lawyer is that the government will settle, and make the whole thing go away. Certainly in light of recent events, if you were one of those making the claims against CSIS, you would have to be optimistic that you are in for a big pay day.

There's more, anyone interested could easily investigate.  How different this board is than other boards, Catholic or otherwise, who knows.  The Ministry of Ed in this province does not want to know.

When I came into office in July of 2009, I had several meetings with former employees on the construction job who had grave concerns about the quality of work.  We hired West Constructors to review the work and to demonstrate proper sheet pile installation.  Their conclusion was that a significant portion of the work, done under the Begich administration, would have to be torn out.  We also conducted an independent review of the geoseismic suitability of the design and the conclusion was it was insufficient.  We downsized the scope of the project, re-designed it and successfully obtained $100 million from the state to keep the project moving forward.   We filed lawsuits against all the parties involved, including MARAD, who were the project managers, not Governor Sheffield.  MARAD failed in all aspects of their responsibilities.

0,"Yes, I put the term 'misdemeanours' in single quotes, in order to alert the reader that I was using the term in a general sense.  The reasons why Ghomeshi was acquitted are irrelevant to my point.  Depending on the circumstances, pulling someone's hair without consent is either an assault, or sexual assault. Upon conviction, the latter charge carries at least double the maximum penalty of the former, as well as carrying an additional social stigma both inside and outside of prison.  Two identical acts, yet the context in which they happen brings very different legal consequences. The fact that some couples find hair-pulling during sex stimulating adds to the incongruence.

That property is all privately owned, and volunteer lawyers are stepping up to help every land owner fight Trump tooth and nail over the seizure of their land.  The appeals will never end.  Did any of you wonder why none of the border state congressional delegations support Trump's plan?  Because Trump will need to seize their constituents' land to do it.  Good luck with that.  Trump is a psychotic.  The sooner he is impeached or resigns the better.  Pence is no bargain, but at least he isn't insane.  The first 100 days days have been a complete failure.

One nailed a pigeon and ate sitting on top of a telephone pole as we watched.    Sad is when development is the culprit encroaching on wildlife, or endangered species. Sadly, the politicians who need money to stay in power are often owned by such concerns. That does need to be checked in my opinion. Lately, Colorado is for sale to huge developers, huge new communities of luxury homes going in on open land that will forever be gone.  But Rocky Flats? I think the eagles like the hawks introduced downtown Denver may also have a roll in this article, to what degree is anyone's guess. The article should have at least mentioned this, for that was big watching all those eagles being released years ago.

0,"Disagree.  Checked online and the Canary Islands has  Mount Teide with an elevation of 12,198 ft, just couple thousand feet lower than Mauna Kea, online pictures show that the mountain, like Mauna Kea Mount Teide has a gradual incline, meaning they can use roads to bring up building materials and ferry astronomers in/out of the new TMT telescope on Mt Teide.  Also the year round weather is pretty mild not that much rain, unlike some steep mountain in Nepal or Alaska always covered in snow or in a snowstorm.  Yes, shipping construction materials and workers to Canary to build the 30m TMT is much more difficult and expensive that building it in Hawaii and traveling US, Canadian, Japanese, etc. astronomers would have a much easier time traveling back and forth to Hawaii than to the Canary Islands across the Atlantic, but clear they cannot tolerate holding up the construction because of incompetence by those in charge in Hawaii and a small group of protestors.

When they picked on Our Lord when his apostles take grains of wheat and rubbing them in their hands on the Sabbath to eat them..etc.  In this Gospel passage (Luke 6), Our Lord so succinctly rebuffed them in like 3 or 4 points.  He used David's example of eating the bread of presence from the Temple (reserved for high priests) because the people were starving.  Here, Our Lord is teaching us a priority in different types of law, not an invalidation of the liturgical law.  He's saying that Natural Law (to seek food to preserve life) is of a higher order or priority than liturgical law.   He's not doing away with all liturgical law.  He is setting an order and giving a reminder.  He points out that the priests of the temple cooperated with David, concurring.  He corrects their understanding of the mercy of God, and he asserts His own authority as the Lord of the Sabbath.

Imagine Russian military installations on Cuba and in Venezuela - do you think our politicians would not cry foul at them? Please do not pretend that we are as white as angels' wings - and, as such, should not be feared. NATO's bombing former Yugoslavia into ashes showed that we are to be feared! What was that? What was the unprovoked invasion into Iraq? Who does have more rights to keep their military in Syria - Russians, invited to the country by the legal government, accepted by the UN, or NATO countries who just slammed into there? Yes, these are rhetoric questions ... but try to put yourself into Russians' shoes: they fear us - and rightfully so. The US was the major instigator of the Ukrainian political coup - so, it's just logical (for Russians) to act before the same scenario repeats again.

0,"The federal government estimated methane emissions at 15% of all Canadian GHG emissions in 2013. Since then, many reports says that the level of  methane emissions in Canada has been underestimated. But even at 15%, the level of methane emissions in Canada is very worrying. Methane emissions have an enhanced effect on climate change because methane has a """"climate forcing effect"""" 25 times grater on a 100 year basis than CO2 (72 times grater on a 20 year basis). Methane emissions from the oil and gas industries are the largest anthropogenic sources of Canadian CH4 emissions, according to Canada's latest submission to the UNFCCC in April 2016. Production of crude oil in the Alberta bitumen oil sands is a major source of CH4 emissions as more and more natural gas is used to extract and process bitumen. It is estimated that around 20% of all the natural gas extracted in Canada goes to process bitumen. Most of this gas is """"fracked gas"""" which is in itself a large source of CH4 emissions.

In the pipeline days the state (and Native Corps) could have published a slew of these books - but chose not to.  2.

0,"The mature view is that the US, on the one hand, and Mexico and Canada, on the other, benefit from NAFTA and would benefit further from updates reflecting the needs of economies that have evolved over the past 3 decades. Likewise, all would suffer a brutal transition and loss of many long term benefits if NAFTA was terminated.  These will be tough negotiations and may be punctuated by one side or the other suspending negotiations or threatening to terminate NAFTA.  However, there are good reasons to believe that after prolonged negotiations a viable compromise solution will emerge.  The key is for Canada and Mexico to remain steadfast and reasonable and not allow themselves to become overawed or bullied into accepting unreasonable concessions to the US or into foregoing reasonable US concessions as part of the final bargain.

I know there are folks who use the plates or placards for illegitimate purposes - example...having a disabled family member for whom the plate was intended not in the car and still parking in handicapped spots. It pisses me off, particularly in the winter, when walking becomes extremely difficult for me. However, I would resent having to produce papers on demand to prove I am disabled. My life has enough daily challenges without having to hand over papers. It would be a gross violation of my rights as a person with a disability.

No, attacking Libya was unnecessary and worse, a predictable disaster, after Afghanistan and iraq.

When the DA offers up a 3 -6 mo time served sentence when the suspect was originally charged with M11 8 yrs + serve everyday charges then 1 of 2 things have happened: 1) they were overcharged to start with and 2) They likely didn't do it and opted to take the deal and the felony instead of rolling the big dice that could have effectively ended their lives.

In this example (to be simplistic), at the highest level is some question on whether the USA can or must benefit from free-ish trade or at another level, whether the USA has any vested interest in trade when it can pretty well make anything it wants domestically (more or less) and if so, under what set of circumstances.... And the answers to these higher-general-principle issues lead to more detailed or adjacent ones like, if you are going to trade does that have any relationship to your other foreign policy priorities and does that in turn relate to how much you can afford to pay (literally) to """"buy American"""" as an absolute and then when you answer that and find that you probably cannot pay for regressive trade practices AND all the other things you have promised or conceived, how much of the protectionism can you afford and with respect to what and so on.

Whether you support or reject soviet-style communism - you have to admit it's not a threat to the free world - it never was much of one (at it's worst it only took a cold war to keep it at bay). Nazism on the other hand set out to conquer the entire world into Hitler's """"empire of a thousand years"""" - and came damn close to succeeding.  Communists today tend to advocate democratic rather than revolutionary change. Nazis still advocate change by genocide.  Nazism arose in a free country.

We have a high quality of healcare available to us here in the U.S. but many other countries have as good or better care. The difference is that the COST of care here (including prescriptions) is several times more expensive than anywhere else.

Because Trump is so uneducated that he doesn't """"believe"""" in climate change--even grade-schoolers have the intelligence to understand it!  Because Trump has shot our standing in the world full of holes, to name a few reasons, and because some people still support him when he only wants to make his billionaire friends even richer and throw everyone else--including his supporters and their aging parents--under the bus.

Seismic work is where they lay out geophones and use vibosize trucks that vibrate the ground at various frequencies and the geophones pick up these and records the returns in a truck with electronics. It's not cheap and it's cold dark work in the middle of the winter. Also worked well logging and many other aspects of production and transport of oil all the way to Valdez and it all cost money.

He said he told his superiors that he had had sexual contact with the teenagers, asked his bishop for psychological counseling, and asked that he never again be assigned to work with children.""""  """"Instead, he said, he was assigned to a job that put him in regular contact with minors, and he stayed in public ministry -- first in youth work and later in hospitals -- another 18 years.""""  """"Last year, Aube turned himself in again. He went to the New Hampshire attorney general's office and, in exchange for limited immunity from prosecution, became a key witness in a state investigation of the church's mishandling of clerical sex abuse cases.""""  """"I'm willing to die for the church,"""" Aube said in an interview. """"But I had a moral responsibility, as the church teaches, to cooperate. I had a moral responsibility to participate with the civil authorities, and that's what I did.""""

0,"That may be fine for idealism, Rob in Calgary, but I don't think that eliminating identifiable groups eliminates poverty, hate, violence, and fear. Many people have shown that, if we focus on eliminating child poverty, then we will eliminate poverty. If we focus on improving female literacy, then we eliminate the highest rates of death among children. If we eliminate male violence, then we will have violence eliminated.  You will say, Just focus on violence, child mortality, and poverty. But the character of many of our challenges is shaped by the ways they are tangled with identifiable groups. Start with those groups, and our strategies then have a hope of being effective.

0,"Well, while domestic abuse rates in Alaska are inarguably high, and far more important; the rates of dog ownership, truck ownership, parenthood, and gun ownership are far higher---The fact that more people are drawn into a discussion on a public forum about the briar's nest of how to get along with your neighbor when he shoots your dog, than can relate to tragic and horrible acts of child abuse, is not necessarily a statement of the jadedness or twistedness of our society, racism not withstanding, as much as a desire to talk about something more people can relate to.  I am aware of racist and classist gestures towards pets and even game animals as being more important than people---I just don't think that's an element of this particular story or its contrast with the other, more horrible tragedy of neglected children; other than the fact that the man chose to kill a dog in defense of his child, thereby making a value judgement in favor of the child.

A genocidal murderer is one who seeks to annihilate a specific group, defined by inherent characteristics (race, tribe, language, etc.) or belief (political, religious, etc.).

They are to be killed on sight, whenever possible.. Every day such regimes exist, they murder.  Those, who stand by, while such murders occur, are complicit. The U.S. and the Russian Federation have been complicit in the murders committed by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

The vibe given off by Mr Razo, whether intended or not, is that there is an unfair target of this demographic group. While this may be the case, it is more likely that there truly is a higher offense rate per ratio of native vs non-native. Be it substance abuse, assault, theft of whatever, if the crime is committed, the time will be served. The deeper issue is identifying and working to resolve the environments or conditions that set the stage for the charges levied to occur. Mr Razo is tending to make this a race issue when in reality it is a social issue. The latter provides the means to look for solutions, the former promotes further division. I agree with """"Me"""" who encouraged more native corporation focus and resources to aid those whom they are suppose to be caring about. There is much work to be done, working in unity is the key.

If the throne speech fails, the LG most likely will agree to let the NDP govern even if they didn't have an agreement with the Greens (it's convention that if a government falls in the first six months you ask the opposition to attempt it), the deal is only done to dramatically lower the risk of her agreeing to a new election.  Clark can ask for a new election after losing the throne speech, and the LG will likely deny it.  Her only hope of staying on is hope someone is unexpectedly absent for the throne speech and budget as once she gets those two passed then any future defeat will result in an election or convince one NDP member to cross the floor giving her a majority, but those two are both hypotheticals that have almost no chance of happening.

Violence in Downtown and on the 'Loop' have closed and damaged small businesses.  Cancellation of the U2 Concert lost income for Businesses and workers who were laid off because of no work.  Same for the Ed Sheeran Concert.  Meanwhile, Many Businesses are also repairing Windows and facing losses - impacting  their income and wages for employees. 2) The violence associated with the protests.  Those causing violence need to held accountable, but people in the protest are not coming forward to report and/or turn-in those who are attacking police of causing damage.  This passivity to the violence is no better than the tolerance of the public and leaders to hold the Police responsible for their actions of unnecessary violence.

Sadly arrogance and amateurism amongst underqualified senior officers killed both the officers at Mayerthorpe and Moncton and the presence of rifles is secondary.

As long as the recruitment, education, development and promotion of leadership is mediocre or outright incompetent incidents like this are unavoidable.

Hypocritically, he's one of those Tier 1 recipients - so he must have been in on the """"con,"""" correct?  Also, he lies when he says that judges, democratic politicians, and unions refuse to change the PERS funding issue, because he conveniently leaves out that Tier 2, and then in 2003, Tier 3 were created to greatly REDUCE benefits and increase retirement ages for newer workers.  He's nothing but a loudmouth rabble-rouser, selectively choosing Tier 1 to talk about (whose benefits are a contract and can't be retroactively changed as upheld by Oregon Supreme Court) because talking about Tier 3 and the greatly reduced benefits for the newer gov't workers doesn't fit his anti-liberal and anti-Union world view.

However, the state has poured vast amounts of money into worthless projects like Port Mackenzie, the Anchorage fish processing plant , KABATA, the black hole port of Anchorage and more while making piecemeal improvements to the Seward Highway.  Half the population of Alaska drives on that dangerous outdated highway. A death today, two deaths a month later, another three months later. Individually they do not garner attention. Cumulatively it is outrageous yet tolerated by our citizens and politicians alike. It is not a traffic enforcement problem. The Autobahn in Germany allows three times the posted speed of the Seward Highway without the carnage.  Fundamentally, the problem is the Seward Highway is a two lane country road, with gawking tourists and people anxious to get to Seward and the Kenai. The highway operates at over capacity with an assortment of heavy, slow and fast vehicles of all shapes and sizes.

It is EXTREMELY dangerous in the FACT it CAN and DOES manipulate earth's ionosphere - causing massive weather disasters - and yes, it can affect human because humans are frequencies like any other living being on this planet.  Disturb those frequencies and watch out.  It is TERRIFYING what HAARP can do.  Based on Nikola Tesla's technology, by the way.

And I promise you: people my age would GLADLY give up that child care benefit and other programs that boomers didn't have if it meant returning to a time where a single household income could put a roof over your head, feed your family, etc.  What's needed is empathy on all sides and a willingness to accept less.

There are a few scenarios.  BBD will not ship to Delta until tariffs are dropped (unless Delta is willing to pay them) which means shuffling its delivery schedule and finding other buyers. I understand the latter is in the works.  Canada will launch NAFTA and WTO challenges. The US will prolong a WTO process for years. The US will not agree to dispute resolution under NAFTA arguing technicalities.  The tariffs may be part of a NAFTA deal bit I doubt it. Canada will resist its use as a bargaining chip. The US is unlikely to drop it without concessions.  The US will eventually reduce but not eliminate the duties. BBD will not ship to the US, ever, since it can sell to the world instead.

Between ongoing battles with the city council over pay and benefit issues, and morale issues since Aragon became chief, many officers not in a position to jeopardize their retirement have left. I have to wonder if Brandt was promoted more due to attrition than due to merit.

Roy was the main reason why we only had 48 points last year and why everyone underachieved. After he damaged the young psyches the two years after that playoff run, he just dropped an already fragile team without a care.  That was the straw that broke this team last year. Roy is mostly responsible for ruining this team. Now Joe is finally stocking the kitty after 15 years of complete barrenness. He has dumped the old dead weight and gotten younger. He has made several smart pickups and good small trades that have reinvigorated the team and lockerrom. We were stale since '03 and Roy spent what little we had and had got a little success which ran out after 1 year. In 1 year Joe has stocked the Kitty, drafted good, set an identity and a direction with a future. Since '03 we had none of those.

This means there were 22 million non-citizens living in this country in 2013.  Now, let's consider the prison population in 2013.  Yes, 5% of the prison population were non-citizens.  But non-citizens represented nearly 7% of the total US population.  So, with 7% of the total population but just 5% of the prison population, it turns out non-citizens are more likely to be law abiding than US citizens.  It is US citizens who are over-represented in state and federal prisons,.  Non-citizens are actually under-represented.

The theistic evolutionary faith is dishonest, confusing and finally useless. Evolution is a cynical theory of death, and I would not accept it even I were convinced that it is true. It deserves our hate. And a God who created by evolution deserves our deep hate. I cannot see any possible harmony between the Bible and evolution. There is a strong conceptual incompatibility between the two. The SDA Church will never become an evolutionist community. Better the whole world be put on fire, than the Church who was designed to uphold the Biblical colors abandon some day her message and mission.

0,"When citizens demand the same enrollment rules, the same eligibility, and equal funding levels across all schools in an area, everyone wins. This includes demanding a rigorous auditing of the school's academics and student performance. The choice option ensures there will be have and have nots in the  public education system and we already have a significant issue in our society with the poor suffering from a lack of healthcare and basic living standards. A good education is something we should be proud to offer all our kids and that starts with good schools for everyone.  Instead of providing vouchers to move kids, why not fix what is wrong with the school in their area so all of the kids succeed as opposed to the few.

They probably blamed it on what they always had , lightening strikes and unattended camp fires. Or in some cases intentionally set to create work. The Fort Mac fire was determined to caused by someone, and not accidental.Times have changed and ever weather event is now climate change, rather then simply weather.Who knew that although change is all round us and is constant, weather must remain exactly the same otherwise it falls under the category of climate change. Although if you altered it slightly it would make sense, climate changes, we have no control of that , but somehow we think we do.

That was etched into my memory and created a deep hatred of racism as I saw the reaction of my black friends, classmates and teammates.  Racism is a scourge in this nation and anything we can do to reduce it makes our nation greater.

The Dead Seas Scrolls were hidden away in a cave 80 years after the Crucifixion to keep them from the Romans.  While they include many Old Testament scriptures, they make no mention of the existence of Jesus.  Not that good ideas can't come out of fiction.  I buy into most, but not all, of the moral code and I think it's necessary for a moral society.  I just don't buy the premise.  If there is  a God/Creator, the Laws of Nature must be His laws.

As most interventions by the developed world have proven, there is nothing that can be done militarily or politically to provide the level of stability and peace these regions require to have their populations stay in place. The notion, however, that the current outflow can be managed by the developed world is just as futile as past efforts have been to give hungry and suppressed people relief in their own countries. Western democracies simply do not have the political will or resources to deal with the mass abandonment of the third world by it's inhabitants. The absorption rate is reaching it's maximum and tolerance is fast diminishing.

Trevor came back from his shoulder injury last year and had some solid games.  Plus, he's more mobile than a lot of people give him credit for.  So far this season, I've been quite pleased.  Trevor is working under a new offensive system, but he's more of a take charge guy.  Also, the Broncos' offensive line is better than it was last year, which means that Trevor won't be spending as much time flat on his butt.  If he keeps playing the way he has the first couple of games, I wouldn't be surprised if he represents the AFC in the Pro Bowl.

I mean seriously, half of the left wing pundits on MSNBC and PBS expressed doubts about the accuracy of the mainstream media in the days after this election, in mea culpas, over expectations of polling.  In the second place, even if we take your interpretation, sorry, but only about a hundred million voters vote in the typical American election, so about fifty million actually is about half of about a hundred million.

You get paid to to lead, to play the most effective players/lineups, and get this team prepared, both mentally and physically. I saw more 'coaching' by Jefferson on the bench. Malone seems to think that 'coaching' is memorizing the stats and opposing player's names so he sounds like he has a clue during the post game. The 1 win that you have this season, you win the game because of Faried's energy off the bench. In your 3 losses, he's barely sniffed the court. I'm not saying Faried's the answer, but he and Beasley at least play hard. A real 'coach' would bench players, (Chandler), for careless turnovers and for playing w no energy/effort.

0,"If you contributed 9 or even 12% of gross compensation then you VASTLY underfunded the pension plan if it is remotely similar to any pension plan available today.  This is not uncommon, most pension plans, particularly public sector pension plans, were VASTLY underfunded for a long time, then a stock market boom made them briefly flush with cash in the 1990's, only to see them underfunded again in the 2000's.  One could reasonably argue that the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan is one the best run plan in the country, if not the world.  In order to keep up with benefits they require 26% of gross compensation to go into the pension plan (13% """"employer"""" and 13% """"employee"""", though the money comes from the same place and goes to the same place so the distinction is purely academic).

To become an enduring force in BC politics, the Greens need a change to proportional representation and to show the public that our parliamentary system can work well in the BC context when no Party has the majority of MLAs. This will require the current accord to operate effectively for at least 2 years.  Likewise, the NDP wants to break the historic pattern whereunder they are with rare exception always the Loyal Opposition and their rare opportunities as Government are short and end badly (and constant dust-ups with the Greens will not promote this objective).  The key is for both Parties to show the public through their conduct that they can have differences but manage these difference in ways that allow ongoing good administration and progress in BC's affairs.

Therefore incidents of conflict between eagles and other species deemed a threat (such as ourselves) are more likely to occur.  I have a photo of an eagle from very close up--he'd lost an eye in an aerial battle with another eagle and was perched on the wheelhouse railing of a long-liner, unable to fly because of his loss of depth perception.  Probably didn't turn out well for him.  But I hold them in special esteem--no just because they're related to T. rex, but because they prey on domesticated cats.  """"Nature fights back.""""

I will live in fear of what health issues could do to eradicate them.  The fact that I ended up with a modest pension in the mix was a fortunate accident as I initially signed on with no promise of that.  Pensions promised, however, are part of a contractual agreement.  They are going the wayside because other options are more sustainable.  Pensions earned, if they are not honored, constitute a breach of contract. Mine is thru a private corporation.  The government should be equally able to honor their commitments.

Unfortunately, given the intransigence of the last 1700 years there will be no hierarchical movement to change this during our lifetimes.  Judging from the past, the future will simply bring more of the same as more and more of the laity feel that their spiritual needs have been minimized by a Church seeking to continue its grasp on sacerdotal control under the guise of the questionable """"holiness"""" of celibacy as opposed to the """"holiness"""" matrimony.  The unspoken and unbroken barricade is not celibacy, because there are married priests. IT IS CONTROL and the refusal and lack of faith and trust in the Spirit to let go just a little of it.

If Rubio had been nominated he likely would have tapped Nikki Haley as his running mate (the two are close friends) and the Democrats would have lost the ability to charge the Republicans with being racist, misogynist and anti-immigrant.  But no, Republican voters wanted the racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant blowhard with zero viable policy proposals and nothing to offer but visceral hatred of the majority of this country's citizens (and if you hate your fellow citizens, then by default you hate your country).

Harsh was the paradise of Indians from Point Hope to Cape Horn. Columbus was a harsh toward the Indians but he was in reality, no different then anyone else of that time period.

No one is better off, in any significant way, because the state of Oregon has approved their union. Blacks on the other hand, are vastly better off after the civil rights movement. By the way, no one is accusing the church or Jules of being anti-minority.

In my own parish we have a Local Safeguarding person (a women), all persons - paid and volunteers - must have a 'working with children check' - a card from the governement (some a national police check)  if working with children and / or vulnerable adults, and specialised training which is repeated every three years. Will this fix things and it will never happen again? No, but I hope it will reduce the risk. So without the Australian government instituted Royal Commission this would NEVER have happened and as quickly. I have a bit of a thing about Bishops apologising publically and I know that saying sorry may just be words.

It has long been recognized as the most important section of that publication and most skydivers will tell you it is the first section they read.  That is because everyone acknowledges that the information contained in those reports may very well be responsible for saving their own life.

They want to go home to their family at the end of the shift. Survival instinct takes over. Vision narrows. It's fight or flight time. And they have the professional training to fight and win. You must use your brain for something besides a paper weight. Stay in the car. Both hands on the top of the steering wheel. Yes sir and no sir. Clearly and calmly tell them you have a weapon in the vehicle. Do not try to show it to them. They will call for back-up. And  if you do as described, you will be fine. Our country didn't used to be this way. But it sure as heck is now and you'all better get some smarts and manners. I don't want to see anyone get hurt, neither you or the law enforcement officer. They feel the same way. Act accordingly.

You can't even learn English from your school age children because they're TAUGHT in Spanish!  Secondly, I don't know what makes these people so darn special that we have to bend over backwards for them. Nothing special was done for the Germans, Poles, Lithuanians, Italians, Latvians, Swedes, etc, etc, that immigrated here from Europe.

This misses the point---nowadays not uncommon for our Governor it seems.    Increasing interest rates won't affect the ability and willingness of speculators to borrow money. However, even if speculators are now often selling to their fellow speculators and driving prices up,  these speculators must feel confident that ultimately there are enough Joe and Josephine Blows out there who aren't speculators and who are willing and able to buy. Once they stop feeling confident about that, their willingness to speculate decreases.  Raising interest rates does make a difference to Joe and Josephine Blow's ability and and willingness to borrow and purchase.

0,"During the dying days of the Spanish Empire in America by the end of the 19th century, the U.S. government decided to become a replacement empire. Having conquered the American natives. Why not take the Caribbean too?  So it conducted a 'false flag' operation to fake an attack incident on its navy ship anchored close to Cuba. (Thus began many such false flags in the 20th century.) The ship went down and the invasion of the Spanish Empire was on! It was an easy job. The U.S. took Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Philippines. And while at it why not take Hawaii too, which it did. No thoughts were given on the consequences of this grab and plunder so typical of European empires.  Consequences: Cuba rebelled and became enemy. Puerto Rico utterly bankrupt, 100,000 left the island packed with defeated people. Hawaii is a huge military base and locals do not call themselves Americans. Philippines went independent after attacked by Japan in WW2 as part of the U.S. military empire.

Bellevue's existing neighborhoods are feeling ignored and thrown under the bus by the current council in favor of big money developers, special interests, and the council's pet projects.

One issue seldom mentioned is that almost all of the traffic damage caused to Canadian roads is due to trucks. The damage caused by trucks increases exponentially with their weight/mass. Thus, a loaded semi causes 9,600 times as much damage as the average car.  Car owners are clearly subsidizing truck owners. A lot of truck usage is essentially but much could be avoided, saving Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars.  https://www.vabike.org/vehicle-weight-and-road-damage/

To the best of my knowledge there were not 2 grids, one for males and one for females. All these accusations of men getting paid more to do the same job seem rather apocryphal.

Since he is not taking an out and proud tone, I suspect he might be an Ace, which can also make someone appear effeminent. Cardinal Burke certainly has such traits as well. Aces have a certain gentleness and niceness to them, but not the empathy to realize that everyone is not like them - especially those who are unaware that they are not simply chaste heterosexuals. As for Ebes64, I cannot say. Whether one is gentle or not does not come through on posts. You can be Ace and still come across as a hetero doctrinaire bully online.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service has no statutory responsibility or authority to deal with drugs, robberies and gun related crimes committed within the municipality of Anchorage. That duty under the Constitution falls to local government (the Anchorage PD) with assistance as necessary from State troopers. The USFWS role by statute is limited to enforcement of violations of Federal laws that address the protection of fish and wildlife; that's """"their job"""". If you believe in State's Rights and are concerned about rising crime rates within the Municipality of Anchorage, contact the APD, the mayor, the Governor and/or the Troopers.

That was before Trump began working to weaken it by spewing his dung, threatening to stop payments and eliminating funding for getting the word out for enrollment at the end of the year.  The net effect of the REPUBLICAN actions on the ACA was to instill uncertainty into the market and the insurance companies have responded with another big jump in rates. It wasn't Republican lies so much as Republicans usual complaining that government is the problem and then making it the problem.  Now that the GOP is in charge of all three branches of government it's their job to make it work and they seem incapable of anything other than messing it up.

Looking at the budget I see that some buildings were built without planning for expansion; Example Panther Lake.  New buildings are maxed at student growth and we are adding portibles w/o support? This was done after the law passed.

Unfortunately our business and civic leaders continue to look in the rear view mirror to determine where we should go in the future.  We need strong and visionary leaders that can lead us in a new world and not try to determine our future by looking at the past. There is no future in the past. We in Port Angeles have come to accept that this is the way it is and we should be satisfied with it...this is not the way it could and should be. With a vibrant and strong business economy, Port Angeles would improve everyone's quality of living and our children would want to live here rather than move away.

It is their responsibility to hear our voices and respond by taking appropriate action. In this case that action needs to include passing policy that will create an incentive for our economy to shift away from fossil fuels and transition toward renewables.  That will not happen if legislators keep opening doors for the oil industry to profit. Where will the line be drawn? When will they say """"Okay oil, you've made us enough money to transition so now we're shutting you down."""" It just won't happen that way.

There's a pretty major chicken and egg scenario going on here between workers and employers.  All the talent lives in the big cities, all the jobs suitable for top tier talent are in the cities. If you're """"top tier talent"""" you may find yourself in a very specialized niche which may not even exist in a smaller city, or if it does, there's one or two jobs - so maintaining access to a large talent or job pool becomes crucial to keep the employment market liquid.  In theory, the midlevel stuff can be decentralized, but that brings with it its own problems - decentralized, scattered offices are quite inefficient and hard to manage.  The bottom rung stuff for the most part is decentralized already.

When  families making six figures can't afford a three bedroom townhouse, or they pay $3000 a month in rent, the term """"low income housing"""" takes on a new meaning.  Meanwhile, Clark has made absolutely no attempt to appeal to young people, families or anyone else really except for those boomers who won the housing lottery.

Some of the negative effects will not be felt for another year or two given the budget cycle but ultimately PERS will demand substantially greater contributions from participating employers (public agencies) which will reduce the amount of money they spend on direct provision of services.  Benefits will consume an ever increasing proportion of agency budgets over the next 20-30 years.

Without having facts and data, this discussion is nothing but subjective speculation or fear-mongering - depending on which side you're on.  I'm not seeing it.

0,"That's right. After WWII, there was a powerful demand for liberalization to liberate the common folks from poverty. The boomer generation was the most radically liberal generation in history. Led by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Eric Burdon and the Animals, and many more working class rock stars and artists,  they brought about a great democratization in Britain, Canada, the US, and everywhere else. Unfortunately, once the boomers got married and had kids, the Reagan-Mulroney-Thatcher trio, with the religious evangelists, rolled back most of the democratic changes and for 35 years we've been pushed relentlessly down the muddy slope of the right wing. The Cameron government tripled the cost of university fees as part of the post-2008 austerity policy. The British Empire dissolved, but we are now burdened by a world-wide multinational corporate empire, richer, more cruel, more covert. less caring about democracy, sovereignty, and people. Class war is their modus operandi.

The U.N. has sat on its hands while all types of atrocities are committed in the Middle East, saving all their condemnation for Israel, not just now but for years.

Their value added taxes raise the revenue necessary for this, which is why the GOP resists such a tax so vehemently. The pain capable argument is valid as the fetus reacts to the procedure, which is rare, even if it cannot perceive the pain. This argues for requiring anasthesia or maybe induction, not a mandate to continue the pregnancy. Few have an abortion that late because they simply decide that they don’t want a child.  I suspect the hierarchy is on the wrong side of the gerrymandering case because of right to life movement coalition politics. Sadly, that does not include passing a VAT and a higher child tax credit.

Her experience is that methadone is used as a stopgap to the next fix.  So give these hard core users clean drugs and at least stop the crime, the overdoses and the drug ghettos.  Also, the brothers young son, just turned 13, is now also an addict.

We have a mean spirited man who has spurned all traditions and generally made a mockery of the position.  By tradition, all public speeches and written correspondence by a President has to be carefully preserved by historians for future generations to ponder. Now these historians have to preserve his tweets full of grammar and spelling mistakes. SAD!  Donald Trump went to Washington declaring war on its bureaucrats and politicians. I predict his presidential address will be similar to his inaugural speech full of anger. I also predict he will denounce the media as his bitter opponents.

You probably enjoy a nice piece of baby cow. You know, calves that are ripped from their mothers at birth & killed 4-6 months later so you can eat veal.  Aside from all that, the planet is already overpopulated with humans. I guess you think we should all be like the Duggers and just breed, breed, breed.  Hypocricy at its finest.

In Hawai'i's case the Hawaii Admissions Act (HHA), (the Statehood Act), unconstitutionally created a US state from a foreign nation, Hawaii. The unconstitutionality of the HHA is based on the FACT that the US NEVER legally annexed Hawai'i, a FACT supported by the 1989 US DOJ investigation into the legality of the US' claim of legal annexation.  Since the 1893 illegal takeover of Hawai'i by 13 white supremacists led by Lowell Thurston many ali'i trusts have been raided by their trustees and boards of directors in violation of their fiduciary responsibility including the Crown Trust by the """"State"""".

Not everything has to be wildly profitable or in some cases, at all profitable. That's what government is for: To implement those constitutional guarantees that cannot be implemented individually or which private business will not provide.   Healthcare is one of those. And since we are the united states, a portion of all of our taxes should go to pay for those who cannot care for themselves, just as we all pay for our military. Last but certainly not least, providing universal healthcare is the ethical and moral thing to do.

Putting a question mark after someone's birth or death date simply says that the date is unknown. It should not surprise anyone that birth records from 4th century Egypt don't exist.  Cyril's life and character are both well known. As a young man, he participated in the railroading of John Chyrsostom, to distract people from charges of fiscal mismanagement by his uncle Theophilus. He deliberately misstated the views of Nestorius, and did not give Nestorius a proper chance to defend himself at Ephesus (and excluded John of Antioch for coming a day late to the council). He expelled the Jews from Alexandria. He incited the mob who lynched Hypatia, the head of the Neo-Platonist school.  All of these are well known to anyone who has studied Church history.

0,"This article is yet another example of the Globe & Mail's anti-Palestinian bias.  The article states that the US """"broke with past practice"""" in allowing the SC to condemn Israel's settlements, and it identifies no instance in which this previously occurred. This creates the impression that the US has not previously allowed the SC to condemn Israel's settlements, but that is false. For example, under George W. Bush, 6 similar resolutions passed, while under the elder Bush, 9 passed.  More importantly, the article fails to disclose that there is near-universal agreement that the settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention. Indeed, the International Court of Justice so ruled - unanimously - in 2004.  Thus, the SC is clearly correct to describe the settlements as a """"flagrant violation"""" of international law, but one would never know this from reading this article.  It's high time that the Globe & Mail report accurately on Israel's abuses of the rights of the Palestinian people.

Currently, the number of STEM jobs going to India and China is staggering-- not because there is no one to fill the position-- but because the STEM education in Asia/South Asia is of higher quality and the wages are significantly lower.  The STEM kids are being raised in an incredibly competitive atmosphere as well, because US colleges are accepting a higher rate of international students who are generally more prepared in terms of test scores.  But what US students still have as an advantage is a creative spirit and a particular kind of work ethic that will take those who do well, far.

The old Ontario Hydro played the """"deferral game"""".  They took expenses and deferred them to future years as if they were assets.  When new management came in (appointed by the Harris government), they looked carefully at all of Hydro's assets, and wrote off billions of dollars of  worthless """"deferred"""" costs --- but the borrowed money used to finance those costs still needed to be repaid from somewhere.

You're making the assumption that the US studies are universally applicable to all environments, irrespective of other economic factors.  As there is no Canadian/Ontario precedent -- any discussion for or against is academic at this point.  It is far from proven.  3.  In the US, Federal minimum wage in real dollars (e.g. adjusted for inflation) is substantially below what it once was -- minimum wage earners have taken a pay cut over time.  Or expressed another way, the value of minimum wage work is not being fully paid for by the employers.  So increasing it somewhat, but still below historic purchasing power, means that the wages are still paid at a discount.  Conversely, in Ontario, minimum wage, in real dollars, is already about 40% higher than historical norms -- even before the proposed $15/hr increase.  Different starting points may drive a very different outcome than the US.

This was a micro snap of the way in which Clark and her colleagues react to the many serious and life threatening issues facing British Columbians. Our staggering poverty rate, 2nd highest poverty rate of children in this country, the housing crisis,  the fentanyl/ opiod crisis, the never ending scandals within this government, environmental issues including the Site C damn which will cost British Columbians millions and is not needed according to experts, our legal aid cuts, our over-flowing prisons........perhaps you get my point.

Mostly """"loud"""" and boomy because that is the """"in"""" thing and permits cheaper reproductive technology.. Ultimately vinyl cannot maintain play-back quality. The original digital music file preserves the recording quality ad infinitum. To obtain true reproductive fidelity stay digital, use a good quality digital amp, and spend lots of money on speakers - and NOT the usual boom boxes. The reason you don't see real specifications of speaker systems is that they are usually abysmal. Also do not fall into the amplifier wattage trap - the real criteria are linearity and harmonic distortion.  Finally - attend a real live concert - especially classical - to get a feeling what original performances sound like.

Pay is often set to the minimum level necessary to keep the faculty member in the face of competitive offers from other institutions.

A winner of prestigious national or international awards, for example, might expect a higher compensation than a faculty member who has no awards or lesser awards.

Also Chase Stout, in the link you offered it says the last time the ice was this small was in 1987, With the massive increase in CO2 in the last 30 years, over 33% increase and CO2 being the cause of the melting, how come the ice got bigger all these years instead of continually shrinking?  I know it's melting, I get that. I have some trouble with the culprit, CO2, and the cure, financially raping the west. In part because CO2 and the melting  does not seem to follow the path presented so many times and the east is building coal fired power plants daily with not a complaint from us.

This is true even of Islamic State in Mosul, where all the fighting against IS is currently taking place. They haven't even started on Islamic State in Syria yet, which is likely to be an even tougher nut to crack. Islamic State is also active in Yemen and across North Africa. So it's not like IS if going to furlough all its jihadis any time soon.  Second, Islamic State is a banned entity under Canadian law.

When Norway launched their fund their oil production was lower and their pool of known reserves was lower than Alaska's production and our pool of reserves.    Norway has managed to increase their production while Alaska's has declined, with oil companies telling us that they can't operate here because we can't expect to tax them.  Their production is achieved with Norway taxing oil at rates much higher than ours.  Norway's fund was launched in 1990, today it is the largest in the world at about 885 billion.  Alaska's fund was launched in 1976 and stands at maybe 57 billion. 15 times less.  Alaska 25 billion barrels  Norway, you say, 29 billion.  Here's the key difference.  In Norway, the public sector has captured the vast majority of rent associated with resource extraction.  In Alaska, the lion’s share has gone to the private sector.

0,"Requiring Tier 1 Unit 13 caribou hunters to only hunt moose in 13 was a step in the right direction. The previous system rewarded the oldest and best liars for creatively crafting prevarications asserting lifelong dependence on the areas resources in order to survive the cruel Alaska winters. As Craig Medred pointed out in countless columns, each fall a legion of urban residents towed their 10K ATVs on their 5K trailers with their 100K RVs up the Denali Highway in a desperate attempt to avoid starvation. The only new entrants were their children.  Many former Tier 1 permit holders refused to limit their moose hunting to unit 13; it would have ended their trips all over the state for other game animals. This allowed new entrants to the hunt, like me, to participate.  There's plenty of room for improvement - the community hunts are too prone to abuse; refine the requirements or lose them. But the next solution shouldn't repeat the problems of the past.

Also, some roads WERE designed with an anti-cycling bias:  have you had to wait at any red lights where the signal doesn't even know you're there?  What about roads that have rumble bars on the shoulders, so you have to ride in the (only, non-passing) lane?  I've seen them all over the country.  Also, your claim about  roads being designed before """"bikes were so prevalent"""" means what, exactly???  Do you realize there were bicycles for decades before cars?

The budget passed, and now signed, could be called a compromise of sorts, but it does nothing to address the State's dire financial crisis. I'm not agreeing with one side or the other as far as 'fixes' are concerned, but I'm just pointing out that it took to impending disaster (opinion) of state shutdown to bring a budget to the governor. This seems grim. However, I have some faith yet that people of all persuasions can and will do what's right when the time comes. Americans have reliably done so for 200 years (minus that 1860 incident) and I trust they will into the future.

I think there's a long history of sports figures doing so. I don't doubt his sincerity based on what I've heard. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues. If nothing else, what he's done is he's generated more conversation about some topics that need to be talked about.""""

0,"The Salk vaccine for polio became available in 1954 or 1955.  Unfortunately, I contracted both paralytic and bulbar polio in 1948.  Out of all the children who suffered from both viruses of polio, ONLY 10% SURVIVED.  The rest, 90% DIED!!  I was one of the lucky ones.  However, I have been using a power wheel chair for much of my mobility for the past 15 years. When I read of people who refuse to vaccinate their children, for various excuses and none of them medical, I have to question their parenting.  There is no way that I would risk my children's lives to an easily preventable disease by refusing the vaccination.  To me, that is definitely negligent!  With all the allergies out today, there are so many children who are unable to be vaccinated.  Those children rely on herd immunity.  To intentionally reduce the effectiveness of the 'herd immunity' because of a paranoia of big Pharma makes no sense.  Would those same people refuse penicillin because of the same paranoia?

Yes, it is worthy of the front page for multiple reasons: - the rescue of over a third of a million trained troops from almost certain capture was a pivotal moment in the Second World War. Had it failed, the war would almost certainly have taken a different, much darker turn. - this Canadian, serving as the lone, non-stop piermaster, ushered the majority of the evacuees onto larger vessels. - Clouston, until the past few weeks, remained virtually unknown and is still unrecognized in a formal sense. Some evacuees who passed by him on their way to safety said that he should have received the Victoria Cross for his courage under fire and his persistence over 5 days & nights. Clouston received no medal. - Bottom line: that a Canadian played such a sustained & significant role during a history-altering event, with no recognition at all in his homeland is a story in itself (how did this guy get missed?). It is certainly worthy of front page coverage.

Surely, in the “Land of the Free,” all adult citizens with adequate mental capacity should be able to make decisions affecting themselves as long as they don’t harm other people.  Death with Dignity allows those who have six months or less to live due to a terminal illness -- and who have the capacity to make their own health care decisions -- to obtain medications that would end their lives painlessly.  Death with Dignity is humane and compassionate because it reduces suffering.

Women led the attack against booze.  This time, maybe men should lead the attack.  Back to Prohibition, perhaps, to protect both men--from criminal charges--and women--from themselves.

With 300% import duties (300%, sounds familiar).  From this standpoint, it's not Canada's interests the Liberals are defending, it's their chances of re-election in Quebec in particular that are their bottom line, just as Trump's depend on support in Wisconsin. It was a famous Canadian who once put the case this way: """"WHO SPEAKS FOR CANADA?"""". We are defending our cows at all costs. So are the dairy farmers from the Badger State.

Quite the opposite - we are pleaded with by our priests to all come together & have parish vocation meetings so that we can pray to have more men to ordain because ordination is so important.  If lay people don't fight bad things like optional celibacy being offered to men for priesthood while we are not ordaining women priests we have no one to blame but ourselves for gender segregation, and the sacramental slavery of women by men in our church.  Nothing starts or continues in a church without at least the cooperation or complacency of the majority of the people.  Women are voiceless because we do not demand equality, & therefore women are also to blame and are partakers, in the sexism, our church brings to the world which ends in poverty, violence, rape and physical slavery.

If one follows the principle of Eccl. 9:10, it won't matter whether or not one has a title; work will be done; the Gospel will advance; the Spirit will lead.  During the great Advent Awakening in the 1800's, sometimes children got up and preached when adults were forbidden to do so.  God's work will go forward, with or without WO.  So, rather than agitating for it, why not just do the work close by, and, if the Lord wants women to be ordained, He will engineer it in His own time and way.   He doesn't need our help in that department.  He only needs willing hands, no ordination necessary.  If we are willing, there is no limit to the potential of the church to fulfill its mission.

President Trump's situaion is a bit more confused, because he is clearly profiteering in his personal business, using his political position to leverage profits at his properties.   He's also hiding all financial information that might show prejudice in his political decisions that would enrich his private estate.

0,"Trump Economics 101  One thing that we can all agree to; is that globalization has brought westerners a greater number of products at cheaper prices.  Moving production back to the US will increase prices, so if Americans want to maintain the same standard of living, they will have to pay more for the same; but in theory, increased prices will be offset by lower taxes.  So the US is the most indebted country in the world, and if taxes are cut in half, and military spending doubles, what will that do to the US debt?

It has nothing to do with the NEA, MOA, ASD Admin, etc. 2) The only time any portion of physical plant bond debt is not used specifically for the allocated project is if the project is completed under budget. These funds may be transferred to another maintenance project & DO NOT revert back to anything else. (see #1 above). 3) The roofs on this bond are pre-90's which means there are hazardous material abatement costs & building code compliance upgrades involved. There is also ancillary damage caused by water infiltration (electrical, ceiling, wall & floor damage, etc) 4) Maintenance is generally 3% of structure value. ASD's Maintenance budget is approx. 1/3 of that. Therefore, the life/safety issues are priority, the remaining issues become """"deferred Maintenance"""".

0,"I can't see the married priest argument having credibility. The argument for married priests as the solution for decline in vocations has already been proven as baseless by the Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church ordains anyone willing to serve. Search for “The State of the Clergy 2012: A Report for The Episcopal Church” produced by """"Church Pension Group, Office of Research"""" for the details. In the “Key Findings” section on Page 2, the report states, “Ordinations overall have fallen by 26 percent in the past six years. Ordinations to the priesthood have fallen by 31 percent and permanent deacons now make up 30 percent of all ordinations.” “Retirements are outpacing ordinations by 43 percent.” “Male clergy make up 62 percent of recently ordained employed clergy and 66 percent of all employed clergy.” The problem is simply one of how to encourage vocations, not at all whether or not one is married. The findings clearly show that married or LGBT tolerance is void of any solution value.

Given that Everett Public Schools envisions a track, baseball diamond, etc. on the rural eminent domain properties, the current zoning does not appear to be an obstacle to building the proposed school. However, it's worth noting that Northshore has a pending request to rezone the rural part of the North Creek campus as urban (as I understand it, for consistency and to smooth the way for any future building activities). The County Council is likely to vote next week on whether to grant Northshore's request, which county planners have recommended for approval.

Impose property transfer tax of 10% on non residents (who are not citizens or permanent residents of Cda) who buy and sell property.  Again, charge it coming and going.  I love that.  I don't agree with any of the above but I just wanted to point out that the LIBs still have lots of ways to stick it to the rich.

Even if each statement is true on its own, the cost and effects of implementing universal coverage will be more complex than some simple combination thereof. For example, think about improvements to health outcomes: what are the extra costs (i.e. more health problems) of people who can't currently afford their prescriptions, and how much will the healthcare system save when they can? Then there are savings to provincial government plans. In BC, PharmaCare covers some or all pharma costs for low income residents. If those costs go down under a universal program, BC saves money. That's just two considerations off the top of my head. There are plenty more. So yeah, it is complicated. (Also, I disagree that pharma companies won't sell to a federal program for less.

Re-Injecting gas at 10,000 psi is at the outer limit of technology and this is why the compressors Exxon purchased have been difficult to keep operating. But the biggest issue is that the Settlement Agreement pushed by the State assumed that a Major Gas Sale (MGS) would have occurred before 2016.  It didn't and there is little chance despite Meyers rhetoric that there will be.  The Settlement Agreement only allows increased liquid production at Point Thomson and a gas line to Prudhoe Bay to support the MGS.  That has been the pipe dream of every Administration since Knowles.  There are other options for Point Thomson that can dramatically increase condensate (oil) production but the Settlement Agreement won't allow that.

And those manipulative tactics worked somewhat for a while, until people started noticing:  1. House prices in Vancouver reached dozens of times the average annual local income. 2. In one generation, elementary schools went from less than 5% to over 75% students with facial features consistent with Chinese ancestry. 3. Those schools were in places (west side Vancouver, Richmond, South Surrey) where houses are most expensive, about two million dollars.  So good luck with your tactics, Scott. We've seen it before.

Khan refuses to support implementing any of the common sense measures such as refusing entry to Britain to those who support Sharia Law or have fought for Daesh in Syria.  Khan also has no problem with the practices of Islamic segregation in Britain -- e.g. special sections of libraries and airports reserved for Muslims.  Imagine if there were special sections of public places reserved for Catholics or Jews.  Khan's approach is one of creative appeasement.  He claims to have post-facto sleepless nights, but he is not identifying and dealing with the Salman Abedi's, Khalid Masood's, Khuram Shazads, et al.  As was the case with Chamberlain, appeasement toward those who would destroy you is disastrous.  And that's exactly the problem with Khan's approach.

0,"Senator Corker is not running for election, and now can freely speak his mind. In speaking freely his opinion of President Trump he is unburdening his conscience, he knows Trump is an unstable 10 year old spoiled brat trapped in a 70 year old body and wants to disassociate himself.   Now Republican Senator Flake has called it quits as well and is publicly calling Trump a liar saying """"Trump has a flagrant disregard for the truth"""", and that Trump is undermining our democracy.  So conservatives worried about being painted with the Trump LOONY brush are starting to do the right thing and bail.  I am so happy, as the USA is the laughing stock of the world with Trump as president, maybe he will declare victory and resign.

If not Crevasse-Morraine, some other trail system that is designated as off-leash.

0,"First of all, I call BS on the $5 per barrel cost of production-even in Iraq. Second, oil companies have reduced production because there isn't enough profit in it. Certainly, even you have a set annual salary or hourly wage for which you will work and won't take a job that pays less. Same with companies big and small. If the pay isn't there, they aren't going to do the job. Third, Cononco Philips laid off 10% of its work force last November, and there is another, similar-sized round coming in September. That's a reduction in company staff; add to that the massive layoffs by oil field service industry companies cause by the postponement or cancellation of capital projects by the big three, and you have massive cuts-especially compared to our bloated state government. So tell me, what cuts did Walker make? Oh yeah, he hired his buddies for state jobs at wages HIGHER than their incumbents.

0,"The Perkins Loan program, formerly the National Defense Student Loan program was established in 1958 and the stories of those who benefitted form the then 3% student loan interest level are historic.  Mostly used for those going in to the profession of teaching, they had their doors of opportunity opened.  Over the many year the loan interest remained low and rose to a 5% level but with such benefits as teaching in low income areas would provide offsets for the payment of the loan.  That program ws manageable and operated AT the Offices of Financial Aid.  It was a revolving fund and worked well, and default rates were again guarded well by the colleges.  Yes, the economy has changed  but the concept of student aid managed by the institution always worked well and reviews were conducted by the feds to ensure the same.  All concerned need to look at the continuation of this Perkins Loan program for indeed it """"did make a diffenrce.""""  I know, for I was one of the aid officers.

I didn't respond to these negative comments. I smiled, kept my mouth shut and held my head high. As I cast my ballot, it was in complete silence.

0,"The Bundy gang seized the Malheur Refuge and occupied it with guns.  Ammon mad a direct threat, saying """"any attempt to remove us will be met with resistance.""""  When an armed individual makes such a threat, the obvious conclusion is the resistance will involve the firearms they are carrying.  Remember, at the confrontation in Nevada, the Bundys and their buddies had weapons and those on the bridge were targeting federal officials (check the many video records of this action if you like).  The federal officials """"backed down"""" to avoid a shoot-out.  Cliven and his supporters whoengaged in this action are now charged with the many federal and state violations they were witnessed committing.  They have not ben convicted, so those remain """"alleged"""" violations and the alleged perpetrators will have their day in court.  I presume you also consider the federal officials who retreated rather than engage in a gun battle cowards as well.  Sorry, but this is not the """"old west"""" of the 1870s....

0,"When the Joseph Boyden scandal broke there were many people who seemed to think native identity was a matter of choice. That one could self-identify. Some compared it to gender identity without any understanding of how complex that is.  There's the Indian Act and how it assigns Status to certain people. Then there's the individual nations and how they decide who is or isn't one of them. Again, it's complex. But at no time can one just say """"I'm indigenous"""" without being able to say what nation you belong to and have that nation actually claim you.  It's a racist myth to claim that non-indigenous people can claim to be Indian in order to get free tuition. That's not how it works. And non-indigenous people can't pretend to be indigenous to avoid restrictions on hunting or fishing. Again, that's not how it works.  There's a vibrant First Nations culture in this country. They know who they are. And it really isn't up to outsiders to decide. Respect is key.

The American government spends $38 billion each year to subsidize the meat and dairy industries, but only 0.04 percent of that (i.e., $17 million) each year to subsidize fruits and vegetables.
