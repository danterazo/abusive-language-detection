0,"As much as it pains me to say it, Wiley is bang on in calling my Canucks mediocre. The Sedins are game, but have lost a full step. On other teams they would be a very effective 2nd line but they do not match up well as a 1st line. Sutter was supposedly brought into provide offense but he is and always has been a checking centre with goals being a bonus. And they use Horvat (their most skilled forward) on the 4th line as a checker.  Time to scrap the game plan and plan for the future. Play the kids. That is the only way they will learn.

0,"Giving this legislature more money doesn't mean they will use it wisely.  For instance, the legislature cut funding for local Legislative Information Offices, which is the real purpose for LIOs.  But they had no problem buying a new building for $11 million after people complained about the one they bought for $30 million.  They cut senior benefits for very little savings, then waste $$ on whatever they want. This crisis is not about providing state services.  The reason people are angry, is that the amount Walker vetoed is being spent on tax credits, not state services.  Walker even went further to suggest using our Permanent Fund to 'invest' in buying and selling tax credits.  If you give this legislature/governor more money, they will waste that too.  They are either incredibly stupid or arrogantly corrupt. Either way, we should not blindly follow people that are obviously not working for us.  Adults stand up and fight for what is right to protect our state for future generations.

All the while City Hall officially sits again on the deeded County Property after getting kicked off of it by the Lane County Commissioners Court long ago for Skinner deed violation.

Mr. Trump is a racist bully who has used underworld associations to 'succeed' in his real estate projects; has perpetrated fraud on real estate and educational schemes; has blamed whole religious and ethnic groups for things they have not done; has intimidated decent people and mocked the disabled; has threatened the media and the right of free speech; has announced he must consult with the NRA on whether to limit sales of automatic military weapons that have killed children and hundreds of Americans.

And Medicare, being the largest of the """"groups"""" has the most negotiating power with the healthcare industry and thus the ideal program for these people.  And after all, if they live long enough, they'll be Medicare beneficiaries anyway.  So build on what you've got already working (and has been for over 50 years).

0,"What else would Cosby claim?  He could I guess lie and say no sex at all happened.  That would be the Clinton route. The reality is the burden of proof rests on PROVING that a rape (sexual contact without consent) happened.  That is rather hard to prove under most circumstances.  But even the accusation of rape with no proof has terrible consequences for most men regardless of the outcome at trial.  Whether or not Cosby and his dates ate 'advertised aphrodisiacs' or drank or did drugs of any number of varieties is completely immaterial to accusations of rape.  Especially if it was taken knowingly with consent.  Proving that it wasn't is again a hard burden in court.  As for why would these women wait so long.  Well that's a damn good question.  I would think that as serious as the charge is most women would report it fairly quickly since so much of the evidence needed for a conviction goes away fast.  But it is easier for a shakedown to wait until there is no contradicting evidence.

For this reason, giving them a charter option seems wise and fair.  Many anti-charter folks seem angry that DPS sometimes closes underperforming schools.  But if a school has underperformed for years, and then continues to underperform while on probation, how many second chances should it get?  If it keeps getting unlimited """"second"""" chances, is that fair to the kids who have to suffer a bad education there?  On the other hand, it's true that starting a charter school near a traditional school may """"steal"""" some of its students and thus leave it with less money, hurting it even more.

0,"Whistleblower laws being broken are difficult to prove and people don't want to lose/risk their jobs only to try to fight them in the courts for 1-2 years or longer with money they don't have. Unions help employees from being fired in the first place and are much more effective at helping employees feel empowered to speak up.  The GOP does not want empowered public employees which is why they're trying so hard to break unions. They want employees afraid to speak up while corporate interests fill the ranks and unethical behavior runs unchecked.

0,"Here are some facts for you. The Muslim population of Canada is doubling approximately every 7-10 years. Their numbers were at 3.2% in the last census but by the next one, in 5 years, those numbers will likely be over 7%. Ten years later it will be 14%. By way of comparison Jews are well under 1% and natives are 4.2%. And the children of Muslim immigrants are not becoming more secular and 'Canadian' but more religious (see Pew Survey). The number of Muslim women in Canada choosing to identify with fundamentalist Islam and the culture of the Middle East by wearing Hijabs continues to rise, going from 42% to 53% over ten years. The number wearing Burquas is small but tripled. The Muslim religion is also a political ideology, governing every aspect of government, criminal and family law. It is extremely and violently hostile to Jews and gays, and regards women as, at best, second class citizens in the care of their father or husband.

For the most part, teams that run the ball well are led by very good running backs; guys who are a threat to bust off long runs any time they touch the ball. Not guys like CJ who might bust off a 20-yard run once out of every 50 carries or so. A top notch running back will also help the line and in turn the passing game.  I personally like CJ and I think he runs hard but I think he'd be much better as a complementary back. What I'd love to see is Denver with a top notch back like Barkley who is complemented by a guy like CJ as well as a speed back like Charles.  Denver wants to grind teams out on the ground but that is never going to happen with the current stable of backs, regardless of the talent or lack of on the offensive line.

0,"I'm willing to give Cardinal DiNardo's first statement a pass.  Yes, it is general and somewhat vague, but it was issued on Saturday, the day these sad events took place.  I have no idea at what time it was posted.  It is possible the desire was to get a statement out quickly, but because not all the facts were known they kept it general.  His joint statement with Bishop Dewane came out the following afternoon when they had a clearer idea of what transpired.  I note that Cardinal Cupich's tweet was sent at 10:34 pm and Archbishop Chaput's fine statement was issued the following day.  Again, these later two statements were issued after the facts were better understood.  I don't think the person who issued DiNardo's first statement should be fired.  For what cause, exactly?  Getting out ahead of the story with a statement that condemns racial violence, hatred, and standing with those who are oppressed by an evil ideology, is not a bad thing. The second statement strengthens the first.

The people and the state and the legislature got screwed (although the legislature never felt it as it was the state and people's money.)  So, basically, the guy that screwed us now wants to sell the building to the state.  The legislators like the building, they underestimate the lasting hate of what it represents, and they think it will go away with time.  And they still trust the owners that screwed us all.  It would be nice if they paid no more rent on the lease that no really doesn't exist and got the hell out of the building, AND went after what was stolen.  And the building would have to face the free market, free from an easy, illegal lease and free from payments by government, at any level.  Then we'll see what the real lease rates are, and what the building is really worth, without the corruption.  Mr. Walker sees it with the appropriate objectivity.

0,"I would vote no. The city needs thousands more low cost rentals for very low income people, and this project, on the Obie side,  would supply none. This city really doesn't need more housing for the well off. The HACSA project has merit on its own. Now, if the Obie project would promise that 10% of his rentals would be available for HACSA's Section 8 low income housing, that would be different. It would help the very poor. Lane County's Housing Authority needs to form partnerships with builders and the city, but this isn't a good project for HACSA residents. It feels like a deception to say that HACSA and Obie are in a partnership. If the city isn't getting taxes, why build the project? Just a reminder...there are seven HACSA Board members, and five of them are the Lane County Commissioners. I do wonder how that vote would go, would the commissioners not vote because of the conflict of interest, leaving the vote to the two resident members to vote? Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon

0,"Question for you Mark.  Let us agree for a minute that carbon taxes will reduce coal and hydrocarbon consumption, lowering carbon dioxide emissions and saving the planet.  The carbon tax as implemented in BC and Alberta exempt lower income people from making that adjustment. 60% of Alberta households are expected to receive a full rebate. Assume the 40% that do not receive the full rebate do everything practically possible to reduce their carbon footprint. They will never be able to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions to zero. Do you really think this tax will have any meaningful impact when 60% of people have no incentive to change their behaviour?  It is no different on a global scale. How can 40% of Canadians reducing their CO2 emissions offset India and China and the developing world increasing their emissions?  Carbon taxes are about wealth redistribution, not saving the planet.

The same records also indicate that the earth has warmed as much as 6C to 8C in as few as 13 years in the distant past.  What is occurring now is taking place with only about a 1C degree rise in global temperatures.  We will see 2C in the very near future.

But it has it's perks, you don't have to put any money down, but you pay a funding fee which is like paying points. And you don't pay mortgage insurance, because the VA guarantees the lender of the loan.

0,"I'm one of those people who has benefited enormously from the ACA. Prior to its existence, my family paid just short of $8000 per year for what amounted to a one-use insurance policy. If any of us had become seriously ill, it would have covered us until the end of the year, and then we would have been dropped and uninsurable. Under the ACA, there are no exclusions for pre-existing conditions, no lifetime caps and an annual out-of-pocket cap. I'm embarrassed to say what we pay today, but it's a lot less.  Is it perfect? Of course not, but it's a whole lot better than things would be without the ACA. We need to implement a public option, we need to increase the tax for skipping insurance and we need larger penalties for smoking. Perhaps we even need to let insurers write policies across state lines.  We also need to get rid of the loss of subsidies for people who earn too little, which is a problem even in states that accepted the Medicaid extension.

0,"There is good news.  Dr. Bruce Anderson of the DLNR, Division of Aquatics is taking a look at this situation.  No better man for the job.  Thank you Director Susanne Case.  The first question to be asked is did Immigration Customs Enforcement or Customs Boarder Protection ever state that these smuggled individuals had the right to fish or even to work in the United States.  That is ICE/CBP's call.  Smugglers are getting special accommodation to obtain fishing licenses for those that are trafficked. Immigration authorities need to approve that.  A work permit issued by Immigration should be required before a Hawaii State fishing license is issued.  I do not believe that ICE/CBP will issue such a permit.  Then there is the issue of the influence of Dan Inouye's desire to make this accommodation.  Not right.  Not legal. But Dan Inouye still speaks from the grave.  Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono speak for the living.  Human trafficking for labor is a crime.  Law must be enforced.

It should be well understood that the first amendment (Freedom of speech) is for protecting unpopular speech, so any attempt to legislate it would  essentially be an absurdity, as anybody wanting to suppress your speech will simply spin it as though you did not exercise your proper responsibility to it. Hence the nonsense that is Senate bill 5064. On a side note, some of our framers made a  similar argument for not even wanting to include a bill of rights to the Constitution because they believed to do so would give government the power to restrict and or revoke said rights through the same legislative process that the Constitution provided to protect those rights in the first place.

They took diametrically opposed position when they sued Khadr's father's estate. The USA seized as much of Ahmed Khadr's financial accounts as possible.  Morris and Speer imagined they contained millions, when they might have merely contained pennies.  Anyhow, they argued then that the USA should release all those funds to them, because Omar was nothing more than a pawn of his father, with no autonomy.  Then, years later, when they realized he might get a settlement, they argued Omar was totally autonomous, without regard to being only fifteen.

The current party in power when first elected about a decade ago did indeed develop the economy, and country's position in Europe and around the world. Then something went wrong and the leader decided that he wanted to become 'emperor for life'. By methodically weakening and destroying the democratic and independent institutions he has almost completed the process of installing himself on the throne. Trump is following the blueprint for installing himself 'emperors for life' set out by Erdogan and Putin.

0,"No one in this story, or in regulated hunting is killing """"the very essence of wild nature"""". The essence of nature is life, death, and rebirth. And guess what? We all participate, even vegetarians, even the purist vegans, as the holiest of vegetarians call themselves. Most meat eaters, including anti-hunters, pay someone else to kill their animals. Vegetarians? They also pay others to kill animals, as do we, in the service of their lives. Think one can grow, process, and transport plant matter without killing animals? Think again. How about the production of hydrocarbons to fuel your car and warm your home? Then there is the matter of running those cars and trucks and other vehicles over living beings, particularly on warm, rainy nights. And on and on. Our living means death to other animals. Continually.  The essence wild nature is being killed not by hunting, but by the destruction of habitat by unrestrained human population growth and industrialization. We're in denial about that.

The NDP self-destructed in what has to be one of the more bizarre campaigns in its history, with Mulcair trying to position himself essentially as a fiscal Thatcherite or even a Harperite, of all things.

At some point, the state, feds, Native Corporations, for and not-for-profit organizations across the state are going to have to insist that a Rural Alaska Marshall plan be developed and employed to provide the basic infrastructure that Remote and Rural Alaska needs to develop robust economies.

Says the same things about Comey's over zealous pursuit of Clinton. No way that is Trump's true reason. The real reason was that Trump did not like Comey's aggressively pursuing the investigation of his advisors and himself. The day after firing Comey, Trump's spokesperson was saying the investigation should be stopped. If this is the motive for getting rid of Comey as it appears, then Trump is impeding a Federal investigation, a felony crime.

As a result, the US alone has lost about a third of its topsoil from factors that include livestock agriculture...More than 70 percent of the earth’s fresh water is used in agriculture of plants and animals: it takes 100 to 200 times more water to produce a pound of beef than it does to grow a pound of plant foods. Plus, the United Nations has reported that the livestock sector is most likely the largest source of water pollution. So, skipping the meat may have more of a positive planetary impact than turning off the water while brushing your teeth or taking a shorter shower! Consuming seafood is also an issue, as we face problems with overfishing, habitat damage, and species endangerment...a Cornell study found that producing animal-based protein requires eight times more fossil-fuel energy than creating plant-based protein.

0,"If the roofs had a return on investment of 6.2 years (as claimed above), why would developers not install them? A return on investment of 6.2 years would be a 16.1% return on their money (roughly). Even developers that """"flip"""" the property would be interested in incorporating technology/designs that yield such a return. Future buyers would reward them for incorporating technology that reduces expenses and provides the yield claimed above. Zeppelin understands cap rates and understands that the spread between a 16.1% return (if it were true) and market cap rates (5% to 6.5%) would be enough to incentivize ALL developers to incorporate green roofs without a mandate. Therefore, I do not think the 6.2 year (16.1%) return on their investment is accurate.  Will the authors of this article please provide the math they used to determine that the green roofs have a return on investment of 6.2 years?

It's intelligent to mitigate risks when possible. We can't stop an earthquake (natural) or an oil spill (human errors), both happen regularly, but we can make the effort to better deal with them when they happen. The long-term failure to make the effort to do a better job at cleaning up oil spills is what has to change, and can change, but only if the public demands it. Government and industry have failed on this file for the last 50 years and there is no sign that things are about to change for the better. For example, there have been no changes since BP's DWH cleanup fiasco in 2010 when they only recovered 3% (three) of the oil and toxified the environment, to this day, with chemical dispersant (the oil did not """"go away""""as it was supposed to).

South Waterfront provides all these alternatives to the max. But recent studies shows that less than 7% of all trips are by these modes.

0,"The proposal is to enhance the taxation of investment income in a corporation by eliminating the refundable element of the corporate investment tax.  Basically, when a corporation earns business income it will pay a low rate of tax, so it will start out with more to invest than would a shareholder if the income was issued as a dividend and invested. When the corporation earns investment income, however, this income is taxed at a special high rate (not the regular corporate rate) that is designed to be the same tax rate that an individual would pay on the same investment income.  The way the law works currently is that a part of this special high tax is refunded when a corporation pays dividends to shareholders. The proposed change is to eliminate the refund, so this income will essentially be taxed twice (once at the high corporate rate and then again as a dividend in the shareholder's hands) which should mimic what would have happened if the shareholder invested it personally.

And the worst part was that if in a period the funds were not there and the group simply cut infrastructure, then the next year, the group got only what they had last year.  These things are DISASTERS. So, no, it was NOT about tax consent.

I observe also that had Judge Molloy been male, she would've been excoriated both for those comments and her verdict.  Canadian society is being swept by a current of reverse sexism. It's not sufficient that women are equal in every way in Canadian society. Instead, there's a train of thought alleging that women must be more equal than men. Women must have special protections and dispensations, even if it means attacking fundamental legal principles and the male judges who apply them.  Too many feminists aren't seeking an egalitarian society. Rather, they want to replace a patriarchy with a matriarchy.

Millions of ordinary Catholics witnessed what their parents went through, as outlined by justmaybe above.

They saw the damage they inflicted on their parents and grandparents. They feel utterly betrayed by a succession of Popes and spineless Cardinals over the abuse crisis.  The conservatives love to blame the VII clergy for the abuse. (It wasn't.) But the one thing that cannot be denied is that the cover up was perpetrated by JPII / Benedict's men. Every single one of them was appointed by those two.  The thought that the People of God will accept a return to that is risible.  Cardinals and Bishops would do well to wisen up soon.

As for Pete Kelly assuming that the per diem is compensation perhaps he needs to look it up, it is designed to cover ones additional costs for working away from their home. It is why long-term per diem and short term per diem is different, but since he sees it as compensation then it should be considered on his income tax forms. If not then he is guilty of tax evasion. The reality is the house passed it knowing full well the senate will reject it, it makes a good headline but that is all it is.

It seems to me that major religious based schools of theology have been stuck in arguing why old arguments MUST be adhered to - by rigorists, Traditionalists, religious institutions who exact a penalty for theologians who stray out of the permitted boundaries.  As for causes which move forward politically without a developed Christian anthropology, I believe that has been happening for a while - how about the advance of democracy, the emancipation of women, acceptance of modern medicine miracles like IVF, the realization now that slavery is sinful.

He chose to hand the hot potato of an apology to a cabinet minister rather than have the words soil his own mouth. He chose to treat Khadr as a hero rather than a traitor, and he chose to make the payment quickly and secretly so that the American medic's family could not collect on compensation they have legally been awarded in a USA court of law. Lastly, it was all done before the summer break so that no-one can be held accountable. He can't blame Harper, or Martin, or Cretien, all of whom had a very different viewpoint on the issue of Khadr.

The idea of locking a cell phone that you get as part of a contract (""""free"""" or at a reduced price) is that you cannot use that same phone with a different cellular provider for the duration of the contract. But once the contract is over the phone is your property, period. Charging for unlocking a phone that you already own so that you can use it with any carrier you want is simply unethical and to me just plain robbery, but that is what cellular providers have been and are still doing. I definitely welcome this long overdue CRTC decision, but it's a shame it does not include mandatory reimbursement of charges made until now by cellular providers to customers for unlocking a cell phone the customers rightfully own.

Those lucky enough to keep their jobs up north saw pay cuts wages- 15-40% pay cuts. The credit cards they gave workers dried up. Hitches lengthened out so they'd have fewer flights which means less costs. Taxing the oil company will absolutely be a lesson in trickle down economics- The tax will trickle down to the employed. They will see more pay cuts and more lay offs and they will take business elsewhere. Bring in actuaries and go through all state programs first.

One of its main remits was to look at solving the problem of providing the Eucharist for millions of Catholics around the world who did not have regular access to it. The ordination of women or of married men would have solved the problem (and many others) over night. Benedict made it clear that such solutions were NOT up for discussion.  The Bishops stayed in Rome in the plush 5star St Marthas 'hotel'. They mooted the possibility of reopening Junior Seminaries (!!) but eventually agreed on the status quo, no change.  On the last day they gathered for a sumptuous meal to close the Synod. The Tablet published the menu which involved three different wines, one a champagne, to go with each course.

To my knowledge, Israel hasn't followed any one of them. Israel will not likely abide by the recent UN resolution about settlements in the West Bank.  If the UN doesn't think Israel should build settlements on the West Bank land, why doesn't the UN organize soldiers from many countries to head into the West Bank to control that land?

The NRC was created by an act of Congress and it will take Congress to reign it is.  That is not likely to happen even with Republicans in the majority.  Congress is controlled by special interest groups.  The producers of natural gas, the petroleum industry, is a lobby more powerful than any other and they do not want to compete with nuclear on a level playing field.   Prior to the creation of the NRC the U.S. built close to 100 nuclear power plants in about 15 years.  The coal industry was the only significant organization opposed to nuclear at that time.   Now the petroleum industry will ensure the NRC continues its work.

0,"I don't think it works with $50 oil.  The article says $7 to $18/bbl.  I presume $7 is best case cost to Montreal.  And I saw an estimate of $15 when the pipeline was announced.  I think $15 is a fair estimate to NB.  Could be $18.  I don't trust TransCanada to tell the plain truth because of their propaganda that Energy East was for domestic use and would replace all the imported oil in eastern Canada.  They left out the part about the refineries needing to spend multiple billions on upgrades first so they could refine heavy oil.  And by the way, how is it unethical when eastern Canada imports oil but ethical when Alberta and Saskatchewan do?  As Prentice advised, look in the mirror.  I also remember Alberta wanted a pipeline to Quebec, so Trudeau v.1 built line 9B with federal guarantees.  WTI ended up priced higher than Brent, Alberta producers abandoned the line to sell oil to the US, and all of Canada had to pay for it.  Once burned, twice shy.

You would think that a central police state would be all """"command and control"""" but that is not the reality.  So let's wait and see if the announcement translates to reality.  All the existing plants are supposed to be using pollution abatement (scrubbing, etc...) by central government regulation but very few do and the government is not enforcing those regulations.  Words are easy - wait for actions.  India is not building any more coal-fired plants AFTER 2022 because they forecast an energy surplus.  Forecasts can be wrong and plans can change.  Ontario has surplus generation capacity partially because a shortage was forecast.

Faced with political structure than openly despises her and builds strategy around her not the nations needs.  A little empathy from Mr. Brooks might be enlightening too.   Not all people complete the circle of self-actualization.  Some are beaten so badly they never heal.

Of the top people involved in the party, many are conservative, but you have some like Mike McDonald and Laura Miller who are federal Liberals.  It's probably around 2/3 conservative and 1/3 liberal in membership never mind they include many swing voters.  The Tories federally got 46% in BC in 2011 while 30% in 2015 so of the 16% who switched most will probably stay BC Liberal or not vote at all.  Now if the NDP-Liberal switchers or progressive Liberals they definitely will go NDP or maybe Greens, but not BC Liberal.

Trudeau, Morneau, McKenna, Butts, Wynne, Notley, Horgan, Moonbeam - Canada deserves each other: uncontrolled spending, bloated unions, higher taxes, hostility to resource sectors - real economic winners...

0,"For higher end vehicles, it is better to lease with 0 down, never pay cash, that money must be invested in high quality stocks not in a depreciating asset, for cheaper vehicles, if you can, pay cash on a 2-3 year old vehicle, this is when most of the depreciation occurs, maintain it, and drive it for a number of years. Never buy a used German car, you will pay through the nose in maintaining it, lease them only if you must indulge. On many BMWs a simple exercise like changing the battery means a trip to the dealer because it will trigger all kinds of warning lights to come on. Never be so stupid as to carry negative equity into a new loan or lease, you will be paying for 2 vehicles while driving 1.

0,"I think you misunderstand what I wrote.  The many people who receive food from the food bank are an indication of a large pool of potential homeless here.  The implication is that we're unlikely to solve the homeless problem simply by helping the 5,000 to 15,000 currently sleeping rough.  The well-documented trend is the increasing disparities of wealth and incomes.  A good source for this is Piketty's book, Capitalism in the Twenty-First Century.  *I* won't accomplish a lessening of disparities in wealth and income.  If *we* in Hawai`i or the US manage to do this it will be because there is widespread recognition that the disparities are related to social ills such as homelessness, followed by appropriate political action.  So, it is not that the details are too complicated.  Rather, the future is contingent and inherently difficult to predict.  Ultimately, it comes down to how much we care for our homeless neighbors.

To remove funding from Catholic elementary schools would be a bonus, despite the fact that it was enshrined in the British North America Act.  My son played rep basketball about fifteen years ago.  The out of town tournaments were held almost exclusively in Catholic high schools.  These were veritable palaces compared to his midtown public high school, which more resembled a gothic horror movie set than a learning institution, with its falling acoustic ceiling tiles, broken lockers and bathroom cubicles with missing doors. Why did this happen?  Because after 1985 so much money was siphoned out of the public school system to fund Catholic high schools and the parallel administration to the public high schools.

There is also the Opposition's particular stance on certain issues to be considered. If for instance as has happened government approves pipelines, they will get Opposition support. In the case of Khadr the Conservatives have been very clear, as have a great many Canadians who don't vote Conservative that they object to the large payment. They don't object to the Charter, they are not anti-law, but perhaps anti large settlement. It is not the role of the Liberals to tell the Conservatives what they can an can not object to.

But governments still have an imperative duty to challenge initiatives  that appear to violate law. Ours did, and the courts ruled for the city. That decision is no less valid for the split vote, and the initiative was no more valid for the number of signatures.  Initiative and referendum are fine tools when used wisely. A referendum, for instance, could have overturned the fireworks ordinance; but no one petitioned for one. There is definitely no authority for a second-class city to use these powers. It would be foolish to throw that tool out because someone couldn't use it, when someone else may know the way.

However, all candidates must raise funds in order to mount a campaign. From whom will these funds come? I believe that only contributions from real human beings should be accepted by a candidate and those contributions should be limited, i.e. capped, in order to prevent such candidates from being beholden to special interests. I was a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders and one of the most compelling reasons for my support of his candidacy was his rejection of funds from the rich or corporations. Because of that, I was encouraged that he would represent the PEOPLE and not special interests. An auditor candidate should do the same. THAT would be true independence.

In the 1970s and 1980s banks wouldn't consider you for a mortgage  unless you had 20-25% down, and the maximum mortgage term was 25 years, with 20 years encouraged. Also, Mr Mason ignores interest rates of 10-20% in the 1980s and early 1990s in assessing the true cost of housing then. I bought my first house in 1977 (700 sq ft) for $57000 with 20% down and mortgage  payments of $600 per month, selling it 10 years later for $67000 with equity of about $24000.

Fishing in the lagoons was rare and the swamp taro pits were abandoned.  People ate rice and canned meat, which they bought with money relatives had earned working for one of the US funded government agencies.  Working age people were all at the urban centers.  My understanding at the time was that the subsistence lifestyle changed when US funds began to arrive after WWII.  Micronesia was first settled about 2000 years ago, and the islands and atolls have continuous cultural sequences since then.  It is sad to see their sustainable former lifestyle replaced by poverty and hopelessness.

They are seeing reduced feeding success due to declining Chinook salmon stocks, are having problems hunting, communicating or resting due to increasing levels of noise in the marine environment, experiencing high morbidity among calves, have high levels of contaminants (e.g., PCBs) and many females that are at breeding age are not calving. A major oil spill event, that impacted the food web in our local waters for 10 years, could conceivably take them below a population threshold that could recover.  Currently the population is at 80+/- up from 67 whales in 1971. The numbers have biologists worried that the population will not survive.

There is nothing fair about a progressive income tax where almost half of the country pays little or nothing of our federal income tax. Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels supported a progressive income tax in their Communist Manifesto. The Founding Fathers of our country did not believe or support a direct tax on individuals because it is detrimental to private property rights and the liberty of the people. They favoured a consumption tax. A flat sales tax is a consumption tax. There is more freedom to choose when you choose to pay the tax with a purchase. With a sales tax, everyone is involved in paying for the bills of the state, not just half of the people like under an income tax.

Many of his opponents are not much better but their weapons are not as lethal as his and so they come across as more benign. Some of his opponents are secular and progressive people but many are really blood-thirsty jihadists many of whom are not Syrians. The percentages of each group are debatable. Many of Assad's followers are Alawites, Shiites, Christians, and other minorities who have suffered at the hands of jihadists and are very fearful of these jihadists among Assad's opponents. Think of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 Russia where many elements were against the Czar but eventually the most blood-thirsty group, the Bolsheviks, ended up on top.  The violence on BOTH sides needs to be condemned and an inclusive comprehensive political solution is the only answer.

0,"I've wondered this too. But what is the alternative? Would it have saved any wages to not have as many firefighters show up? Those six firefighters were on the clock in case a really serious event takes place. As you may know, this is called """"sunk costs"""". Seems to me it is best to have them all show up - at least for training purposes - since there was not a greater emergency at that time. As a coach, you likely know that parents second-guess your decisions. I think that even though I might disagree with the call by the fire department, I'll first trust in their decision since they're the experts and I am not. And keep up the work helping kids make the right decisions.

It's hunters and fisherman, not generally liberal, that should feel most protective about waterways and the species those streams and rivers support.

No matter how we fish here in Hawaii that doesn't change the fact that Hawaii's demand for fish is skyrocketing and is only going to grow. In fact, globally the demand for seafood has quadrupled since the 1960's. This is a large problem even if Hawaii is fishing 'sustainably'. Even so, we export a large amount of our catch outside Hawaii compounding the problem. 63% of the seafood we eat here in Hawaii is Haole/foreign and who knows the quality. Case in point the recent Hep A outbreak from Indonesian Ahi cubes.  My main point is that we should be valuing and prioritizing our natural capital over our own selfish means. We actually get more in return by practicing this value. Our current growth economy isn't working. You don't need to have a PHD and 20 years working as an economist to figure that one out.

It's what the thrust of colonialism was all about. The consequences of fraudulent religion are tragically with us. If the objective of religion is to witness to and teach what Godlikeness means, then, a radical overhaul of religion is needed. Authentic religion is about authentic relationship. If we don't understand how we all belong in and to nature in the same way, then, our religion needs a lot of overhauling. If we don't end the fictitious presumptions of religion we live by, we will continue our habits of self-arrogation and sacrileging the Living Sacrament we all belong to in the same way.

For the vast majority of bills that are signed into law, it is relatively unimportant.  However, on the big issues that greatly affect us all it can be extremely important.  What we can't or should never do, is to simply erase law without having the proper 'fix' in place to correct for what we believe to be bad law.  The reason is simple, it is called government gridlock.  In the case of Health Care,  Numbers would indicate that one-half of voters are opposed to Obama Care, slightly less than one-half seem to favor it, and the balance is undecided.  The problem is that neither side right now can come up with a solution to the problem.  If we simply repeal the existing law with out working out the correct solution, millions of our citizens will end up being without health care again.  This would be horrible for the US.

The state is better educated that most, (mostly true of primary education), because of their past experience they can better judge, (might be true, skills do improve and the caucus system is very focused an active participation).  But what goes unsaid, is that Iowa is very much a white culture complete with a strong protestant work ethic and above average Christian participation.   In other words, it's the prototype of the American dream for White America.  It also means Iowa has few solutions or empathy for urban poverty, immigrant culture (although they famously employed thousands of illegal immigrants in meat processing plants). or racial animosity.   This is the quiet racial prejudice that Charles feels, but other do not.  Iowa and New Hampshire don't deserve privilege.

How about hiring or giving employees enough hours to make ends meet, instead of keeping their hours below 30 per week to hit artificial expenditure targets that Managers have to meet, or they don't get their Quarterly Bonus Payout? How about REDUCING massive wages of CEO's that are 100x what a floor worker makes? Stop paying the 1%'ers so much cashola & you can hire more bottom-end workers to better staff your stores. Ever been to a Lowe's? Or a Home Depot? Ever had to search the whole store to find a single harried employee wearing 4 different hats, to try getting some help? The CEO of Home Depot makes 10.2 *million dollars* per year total compensation, $900,000.00 *in cash*, every year....  but sometimes you walk in the store, and you've got maybe 6 employees in the whole place, & 3 are cashiers.

Ancient teachings of morality are all well and good, but out bishops must do what is necessary to defend the church against all enemies, real or otherwise.  To that end, they have told us to support Mr. Trump.  That is the end of the question.  Remember, these great men were selected by God himself to lead the church.  Who are we to question them.

This left the city unprotected for a time because of this one incident and the crowd of people threatening to interfere or riot.  This is not acceptable. I don't want this type of crowd incident to happen again. I hate to suggest increasing the number of laws we have on the books, but if there are no laws which discourage what the crowd did, there should be. Any time a crowd of people interfere with an arrest by police officers and require additional officers to respond, the people involved should be cited and fined heavily. Perhaps an ordinance is needed requiring people to maintain a certain distance and decorum when an arrest is being made.  Also, perhaps citizen education is needed, since some seem to believe they can do whatever they want in Eugene without consequence.

0,"I actually think the real problem is that Canada has lost a heavyweight.  Most of Trudeau's team is astonishingly callow, including the PM himself.  The lack of experience in life, in actually running things is painful to witness.  People are gushing over our new Foreign Affairs Minister by noting she's a journalist who has lived abroad as if that's all you need.  It's pathetic.  A journalist has the background to be a FA Minister!  Others at the table are even more hopeless with many of them still to win their spurs in any field.  Andrew Coyne's article in the NP hit a home run on this issue in comparing the cabinet selection process between the USA and ourselves.  However, he did concede that our cabinet ministers, by and large, simply do what the PMO requires and do so with gratitude.  Heavy hitters, for the most part, they are not.  Dion was of a different order and he will be missed across the country.

Per your theory, the government will eventually take your whole paycheck (sounds like a particular grocery store chain), yet the problems will not have been solved.

Parents of Ainsworth Spanish Immersion kids are against changing the Spanish immersion program because it’s regarded as one of the best SI programs in the city. It’s in high demand.  It's a winning formula. The school gets great results.  Success stories in education are hard to find & we need more of them. We should be looking at how to create more 'Ainsworths' in other locations, instead of dismantling them & spreading the resources wafer thin.

In 1990 the average health insurance policy generated 10% profit. 90% was paid out one way or another. By 2016; the pure profit has jumped to 20%. If we could buy drugs from Canada that were manufactured in the USA legally they would be cheaper in some cases. The Republicans under Bush 2 eliminated free trade in this case. And they refused to allow the government to negotiate lower drug prices with the manufacturers. It is no wonder drug prices are through the roof and taking profits with them. Most all non profit hospitals have several employees making well over a million dollars a year on the payroll. Over 10% of what the government pays out for medicare and medicaid is fraudulent yet prosecutions are at an all time low.  Name any other industry that has a monopoly that is allowed to make such outrageous return on investment. The whole system is broken and corrupt with no hope.

0,"TD, having actually taught Econ 101 for the University of Maryland, I think I can say for sure that Trump and the GOP's hatred for ACA is a primary reason ACA has not been more successful.  Actually with all ACA's economic flaws, it has been a successful program.  The major flaw is it's lack of control mechanism for actual medical costs, thus increased insurance company premiums.  The Medical industry lobbyist have been very good at insuring their representative medical companies have remained free of cost controls.  Germany has a medical system that works, it's an excellent model that insures everyone, includes the private insurers in the process and actually provides better medical care for a lower GDP cost to the taxpayers.  There are many other good national programs, like Medicare and VA, we simply lack the political leadership to correct the medical care industry in this country.  ACA is a political problem, not an economic one.

0,"The notion of rights as inherent in human nature is a philosophical concept. Rights in law, individual rights enshrined in the laws of this or that land, is a very different conception of the same word.  The question whether healthcare is construed as a philosophic right depends on the philosophy adopted. Adopt as one's core philosophy the tenets of laissez faire capitalism, and one might conclude no such right exists. Adopt as one's core philosophy the tenets of Christianity, and depending on your version of Christianity, the notion that healthcare as a right can be derived without great effort from the golden rule.  In the current context, the question properly put is whether Americans ought to adopt healthcare as a legal right? If they answer in the affirmative, and if they elect lawmakers who actualize that affirmation in law, then ipso fact healthcare becomes a right in the US; just as it is in virtually all other first world countries.  American's decide if it is a legal right.

And when multiple people make allegations against the same person, it’s harder to see it as a coordinated hit job and easier to see a sexual predator revealed. Jail, public shame, lost business… that all kind of depends on the strength and severity of the allegations.  Re: Moore, this isn’t Rolling Stone relying on one witness and her close friends for a story. It’s the Washington Post relying on multiple, unaffiliated sources.

Jains are less than 0.1 percent. At what stage does the minority religion become significant? 5 percent? 10 percent?  As for the public efficiency part, an economic fallout of Christmas is that all shops have to be closed (except pharmacies,maybe?). In India, when one religion is celebrating their festival, the stores and businesses of the other religion's traders and workers remain open. Why is the holiday enforced in such an anti-business way? After all, one should be free to decide whether to work that day or not. I believe that Boxing Day is also a required holiday for stores.

0,"What is needed Dan is balance between conservative and liberal forces. Too much of either isn't good.  Unbalanced conservatism gives us """"robber barons"""" and unbridled capitalism, where regulations for workplace safety, child labor, sweat shops and other worker abusive concepts are removed. The same is true for environmental regulations which would also be tossed aside.  Too much liberalism would lead to an oppressive regulatory state with top down control of all things including transportation, industry, the military, schools, health care and all aspects of the economy.  Today, the concern isn't too much liberalism so much as too much conservatism, with conservative control of all three branches of government.

0,"The projected revenue in tax for the 1st year(2016), $3.5 million dollars, the 2nd year(2017) $12.5 million dollars for the state of Alaska. Alaska consumes the 4th largest amount in Cannabis between medical and recreational use in the US. That figure for consumption is in tonnage. Simple math, if there is a $50 per oz tax, 1lb of Cannabis nets $800 per lb. 100 pounds at $800 is $80,000. So, if ONE facility grows 100lbs. every cycle, getting four cycles a year, that's $320,000. That is only the excise tax. Add anywhere from 5%-8% at the retail tax level, and the amount grows even higher, Now imagine, 100 cultivation and 100 retail businesses contributing to that collective amount. So, YES, millions of dollars are being lost every 3/4 months they stall.  I am a small business, I plan to hire 10 people. Simple math, if 100 businesses hire 10 people, that is 1000 jobs.

Cats left outdoors to fend for themselves die in horrific ways--they are torn apart by dogs, tortured  to death by sadistic people, their body parts rot off from disease, they suffocate on their own mucous from upper respiratory infections, they're hit by cars and die slowly along the side of the road from blood loss or trauma, they freeze to death or lose appendages because of frostbite, and the list goes on and on. Euthanasia is more humane. Those who are made hysterical by the thought of euthanasia should work on preventing cat homelessness in the first place, by lobbying for laws that require cat owners to keep their animals indoors, and sterilize and microchip them.

0,"The reason that this article reads like a bunch of random text from monkeys typing on type-writers is simple enough: Donald Trump, as described in the article, has nothing to do with Canadian real estate.  You might as well try to write an article about the effect, on Canadian real estate, of the brightness of the dark side of the moon, or of the popularity of mango juice in Liverpool.  Vancouver and Toronto real estate prices, raised in the article, involve overseas money flooding in, mainly from China in the case of Vancouver, and much from China in Toronto with a mix from places such as Russia and elsewhere.  It is overseas money that gets house prices to skyrocket to dozens of times the average annual local income.  And so unless you are going to connect (which you do not) Donald Trump to the spending habits of millionaires working in Shanghai and Hong Kong and Beijing and Chongqing and Moscow, you might as well write about mango juice and moon rocks...

Its intimidating to walk through that and risk activating or disturbing those defiantly blocking use of the sidewalks as well as the Plaza and other places.  There SHOULD be someplace to go and to group together if that's what they want.  However, wholesale hostile overrun of public space by folks whose entire end destination is there or nowhere, and won't engage anything else, changes its use.  If the space was meant to be used this way its design would be different.  The Plaza wasn't designed for groups of 25-35 clogging things. Either you engage the people themselves and deal with their individual needs and create an attractive alternative, IE find out what besides camping on the sidewalk will solve this, ...or you reconstruct the law or the space to accommodate or reject the presence.

In Western Canada we have vocational schools that teach trade skills through grade 10-12.  They consist of college-level classes that are graded and count towards a high school diploma.  Some programs are: welding, auto mechanics, electrical technology, computer systems, and cosmetology.  The problem is that not all provinces accept these credential to allow one to start their apprenticeship.  Ontario is notorious for this as they want people to apply for """"pre-apprenticeship"""" programs that can run 1-2 years at various colleges for thousands of dollars.  And THEN one can try to APPLY for an apprenticeship with NO guarantees.  It's pathetic.

0,"The tax on large ticket items like automobiles--bought from companies that have more than 25 million dollars in sales and have narrow profit margins--is a legitimate concern. If the profit margins are too narrow, then pretty clearly the companies will have to pass through a larger portion of the 2.5% tax. This will tend to affect wealthier consumers more than others. The market will work out the prices here. And I'm sure that there will be future lobbying for special considerations in these cases.  But put this in perspective. Try buying a car in Washington or California. The additional 2.5% or less that some purchasers of cars will pay in Oregon is a small fraction of what our neighbors pay in sales tax. And yet plenty of cars--more than plenty--still get sold in Washington and California. The market usually knows how to price things effectively.  The need for Measure 97 is here. We should pass it and work through the problems. There is always fine tuning in the process.

And you might not be aware that the tax code will not tax me for the gain in my house so that is a factor in deciding to move and not , as you claim, a reason for staying.

There is a thickness of mind to someone who uses the Hindu religion as his Commentator pen name whilst constantly attacking Christianity and the West (the historically Christian West being where he presumably chose to live) while defending Islam which, being the national religion of Pakistan - I'm sure Hind is aware of the history as he has regaled us with his """"Fractured Fairy Tales"""" version of it ad nauseam - is neither positively viewed nor much-tolerated in modern India.  Gives new meaning to, """"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.""""  In Hind's case, the phrase would more accurately be reframed as, """"My hosts, the targets of my enemy... are therefore also my enemy!!!"""" Doesn't make much sense, does it.  But imagine Hind crouched in front as Celest gazes up into the nether heavens and all will become clear as the stars in an overcast sky.

Some stats show tobacco's MORE addictive than opioids. Keith Richards and Jimmy Page both quit heavy heroin habits - but both are still smoking cigs. There are many more like them, ex -junkies committing slow suicide by cigarette. Alcohol & tobacco cause numerous deadly diseases dreaded opioids do not.  .Spain&Portugal have decriminalized possession of opioids&cocaine and incidence of their use DID NOT rise, contrary to your theory. Prohibition doesn't work.

Because states had generally modeled their civil court processes on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the role of guardian ad litem was well established. But now, states began moving toward stronger legislation of their own. By the 1990s, many states had enacted laws specifying the guardians' qualifications, duties, and authority.

Non-Profits/Private [i.e. WCLT) ownership  = 617.2 acres. inexplicably, the Comp Plan inventory omits Trillium Woods. Adding that in gives a county total of about 1,297 acres, not """"thousands of acres"""", and that's for the county as a whole. WCLT also holds conservation easements, but these are not necessarily open to the public or dedicated to habitat conversation (i.e. ag/forest land conservation easements).  PS: Your statement that """"Another 40 acre acquisition of expensive, mature forest land will be far more expensive than a public swimming pool"""" is ludicrous.

Remember that the VAST majority of people in Galilee and Judea rejected Jesus and His teaching, and that, even today, more people globally are not Christian; therefore, using your logic, that means that His Gospel is false and invalid.  Peter denied Jesus, Thomas doubted Him.  All but John ran away in cowardice when He was arrested and crucified.  By the logic of your comment, because of their history in this, the Apostles should have """"shut up"""" on all matters of the Gospel.

0,"That was the claim, based on the carrying capacity estimate.  It has taken a long time to fully appreciate the scale of traditional Hawaiian agriculture.  When the first detailed land records were developed during the mahele in the mid nineteenth century, the Hawaiian population was down to about 80,000, which was a fraction of its pre-contact size.  Consequently, those records yield a picture of a substantially diminished agricultural base.  Recently, however, collaborative teams of farmers, soil scientists, and archaeologists have developed GIS models that do a good job of predicting where old agricultural fields will be found.  In my experience as an archaeologist, the models catch the larger fields, but miss some of the smaller ones, so they are likely to yield """"conservative"""" carrying capacity estimates.  At this point, I think the claim is plausible that traditional agriculture might support 90% of our current food requirements.

This was likely done with a standard single shot rifle designed for long distance shooting. Don't be blinded as to making drastic assumptions based upon the garbage fed to you by mainstream media.  Additionally, the gun control measures you speak of would have done nothing to stop this incident from happening. The true issue here is the intent of the people that tragically decided to take the lives of the officers as a means of revenge that they """"unfactually"""" justified (as we don't know the facts behind either of the two officer involved shootings yet).  People need to start focusing on the problems causing these issues and stop trying to turn the situation into something that fits their agenda (ie. Gun Control). The issue here is the same as with Orlando and that is intent. Whether it is a bomb or a gun, both incidents still happen as the intent to harm is present.

0,"Mefloquine and its relationship to mood disturbances has been researched to the nth degree in the past.  The bottomline is that if you come into the military with mental health issues, and there are a lot, then put a soldier through a war you are only going to exacerbate those problems to the point one will see depression and suicide even without taking mefloquine.  If there is poor access to mental health resources as there was in the past then one will easily blame the pill rather than the tour of war.  Mefloquine is still used for malaria protection IF the person has no previous history of mental health issues such as depression.  The drug can worsen symptoms of depression, but if the soldiers who use the drug are screened appropriately it is a very safe drug.  We don't need another inquiry into a drug we know inside out.  Was it prescribed in appropriately in the past,...likely but in most cases once stopped the symptoms resolved.

Al Franken did not take his seat until June 30 2009, because Republicans were contesting his election.  In May of 2009  Arlen Specter switched parties, giving the Dems the 60 votes they needed to pass legislation, provided they could get 58 Democrats and two independents to agree.  In August Ted Kennedy died, and his seat was won in a special election by Scott Brown, who took his seat in February 4, 2010.  So the Democrats had the 60 vote supermajority from June 30, 2009 to February 4, 2010  In addition to the ACA, they passed the Stimulus Bill, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, the Consumer Protection Act of 2010, repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” reformed the student loan program, ratified the Salt Treaty, and confirmed a justice to the Supreme court, in spite of Republican obstruction every step of the way.

Aside from the effective """"lightning strike"""" odds of getting picked by a serial killer, the rest of the killings match what is typical; people victimized by associates with histories of violence, typically involving gang or drug activity or ongoing domestic violence relationships. If none of that is part of your life your risk approaches zero.  Every study on the subject bears out that ones associations are the biggest factor in risk of being victimized. Papachristos in Chicago (and Boston), the CDC in Wilmington, MD, the King County ER study, etc, etc. If you don't have violent people in your first or second degrees of separation, your risk of being victimized is astonishingly low.

From my perspective these were the two most flawed nominees I have faced in my life as a voter.  At times I planned to leave blank the top of the ballot.  Unfortunately, I do believe and reject much of what Secretary Clinton said.  I have not been impressed with her record on foreign policy and believe her health care ideas are well intended, but seriously flawed.  On the death penalty I agree with Clinton.  On immigration, she is clearly more morale, but seemed unlikely to accomplish much in terms of positive change.  Thus, in answering the NCR's call for dialogue, I sought to explain the dilemma as I saw it.   Perhaps answering that call was for honest dialogue was my mistake?

0,"There is a huge amount of room between the efficient market cost and the black market cost. Illegal grows focus on concealability rather than economic efficiency, and so their costs of production are VERY high. In addition, the black market has a risk premium built in to every stage of the distribution chain, resulting in very high markups being added on to the very high cost of production.  In a legal market with sensible producer regulation, the cost of production will be in the range of dollars, at most tens of dollars, per kilogram, which is to say at most a few cents per gram. Given the markups and handling costs typical of a legal distribution system, I would expect retail prices before taxes to be in the range of five to ten cents per gram. Given that the current black market prices run five to ten dollars per gram, the government can capture a lot of taxes while still substantially undercutting the black market.

No point in fighting progress if the new procedures are better and cheaper,may as well reflect that in allowable billing fees.  Extra Money for GPs sounds good, especially if it helps them have longer and more flexible work hours.  Not sure about the clawbacks on the high billing amounts. Seems if a doctor does their job properly and can bill that much, they deserve it. Would rather we audited and investigated more poor practising doctors instead.  Also it seems we could increase medical school enrollment significantly (at least +50%) to increase the supply of doctors. This would help provide better coverage and stop too much high billings.

In my opinion the Girdwood Fire Department has no right to go outside of our Service Area to provide EMS service for the MOA.

0,"I suggest you do some reading about what is actually occurring in Catholic churches in different parts of the world---even in Europe.  There are not enough ordained priests [some are in their late 80's and early 90's in age] to minister to the people, and Parish Life Coordinators [most often nuns or lay women] actually run the parishes.  In parts of Central Europe, there is only one elderly priest for three or four parishes [and the priest doesn't life close-by].  The parish life coordinator hires and fires staff, holds week-end Communion services [the three weeks that the priest isn't at the church], holds funerals, and since most of the time, there is no priest to administer the Sacrament of Penance to those ill [who may be in danger of dying], a service is held---guiding the ill person to make an act of contrition.  Your comments about women are one sided.  Women have been doing this for some time, now. More women are prepared to be priests than there are now seminarians in the U.S.

0,"You're still injecting a lot of fantasy. I base my opinion about conservatives being more likely to press the trigger on, again, on my own anecdotal observations. Specifically, conservatives (not necessarily politicians, though) tend to do that which is necessary even if distasteful, arduous, repugnant, or painful. Progressives tend to shirk those sorts of tasks by any and all means available. So when the situation calls for a well-aimed trigger press, a progressive is likely to want to negotiate while a conservative is likely to press the trigger. Read more carefully here. I have never said progressives do not have guns. I stated and supported the position that conservatives have MORE guns. Your illogic about me not being able to shoot an idea therefore makes me feel entitled to shoot a person, is remarkable and consistent with the nature of your earlier posts on this thread. As to who I think I am, do you really want to know or is the question merely rhetoric for a put down?

A left-wing or non-white accused would be likely to feel he wouldn't get a fair trial in front of a judge with a Trump hat.  On the other hand, we seem to be in agreement that what he did was wrong, but that it doesn't justify removal from office.  So that's good.

0,"The growth of societal adaptation to legal marijuana is as complicated as was the question of alcohol, though being compressed over a far shorter time period.  In the 1800s there were virtually no laws regulating the sale of alcohol other than paying for a city license;  Eugene's newspapers  frequently complained of the number of saloons, and drunks, to be found downtown. Finally in 1920 Americans were fed up with the problems of alcohol and passed prohibition.  But that didn't stop drinking, which led to speakeasies, bootleggers, backwoods revenuers  and eventually violent gangs. Finally in 1933 Americans became fed up with prohibition, but then followed a more gradual reintroduction with stricter laws.  We had local option to preserve choice; when I was young Oregon still didn't have """"liquor by the drink"""" which meant you carried an OLCC card and your own bottle. I imagine as the world of legal marijuana evolves we'll develop similar problems, and solutions, along the way.

To them the defeat of the Japanese Empire, Cold War, Vietnam, the Korean War are not relevant to the present peace and prosperity in Asia; it is history, old,obsolete. But in reality,  the US (like most nations) for the purposes of dominance in war and trade. Has created, over time, a web of entangled trade/aid/defense agreements that have exchanged trade concessions, development assistance, and arms sales for say... resource rights, missile silos and military bases in foreign countries. The Americans bribe as often as the bully, to get what they want. There has been plenty of bullying and bad dealing by the US as well. Powerful and rich America has utterly dominated geopolitics for 60 years . It has committed and abetted numerous atrocities in Asia and lost a couple of disastrous hot wars with impunity. Of course that is inconvenient to Trump's """"America as victim"""" narrative.

0,"It can easily be a self-funding program. No cost to taxpayers. On the other hand, renting in old age generally means an added cost of $5,000 per senior per year to government services, in today's dollars. That's up to $150,000 per senior. Or, we could chose home ownership for all, at no cost to taxpayers, and save that $150K per senior.  It's no secret that many mean-spirited Canadians love to hold people down and maintain poverty, but doing the right thing today is far less expensive for taxpayers. Greedy mean-spirited profiteers who prey on modest earners in the rental market, are plainly wrong.  All rental traps can be tomorrow's condos and co-ops. We must phase out renting asap. and let everyone prosper and enjoy life. There's no good reason not to.

Then in order to at least pretend to achieve a balanced budget for the first time in his tenure. Harper starved programs  for funding and sold off government assets at fire sale rates. The phony savings - layoffs and lack of training in the Phoenix pay system and Shared Services IT systems will cost the Canadian  taxpayer millions more than necessary to fix the resultant problems..  In fact in his desperation to finally produce the appearance of a  balanced budget, Harper short changed many government programs. He fussed far more about appearance than reality and as a result his government provided  the worst financial management in recent  Canadian history.

In my opinion, it is this set of attitudes -- love equals rules, Jesus doesn't know how to summarize His own leadership and emotions, Church hierarchical rules equal perfection in faith, parents are incorrigible so bypass the family to create a new perfect generation of our own vision -- that has emptied our churches.  To address the topic of the article, I represented my parish in our diocesan synod about eight years ago.  The diocesan newspaper tells us each year what a great success it was.  I'll shorten a long story to simply say that when parishes and deaneries dialogued about the mandates, the powers that are accepted exactly zero changes to an already perfect document.  That is not hyperbole  -- zero changes.  I don't place hope in synods anymore.  Just another plaintive cry of """"Why won't people obey my wonderful humble faithfulness?""""

0,"Darrel Galera is a proven leader in Hawaii's Education landscape.  I may not agree with all of his ideas, but I think he's probably the most qualified candidate for the position of State Superintendent.  He also made a logical candidate for last minute appointee when Jim Williams resigned last summer.   He was a major driving force behind the formation of the Education Institute of Hawaii which has hosted three annual conferences to date.  I've attended them all.  My favorite was the first one with Pasi Sahlberg and Diane Ravitch as speakers.  We need a strong leader with a proven track record of at least *trying* to reform the bogged down state DOE bureaucracy and reducing teacher paperwork.  Mr. Galera is the only person I can think of in Hawaii who fits that criteria.  I am often the first person to suspect a DOE hinky conspiracy, but in this case, I think Mr. Galera would be good for Hawaii.  In fact, I think he's such a shoe-in I don't think anyone else should waste time applying.

Trump's jingoistic tough guy act was celebrated by the cable news outlets that inform Trump's world view as if he had just been anointed homecoming king, much as they fawned over Bush's """"Mission Accomplished"""" puppet show. However Trump and his novice foreign affairs team don't fully appreciate that the war in Syria is not a simplistic, binary conflict. It's a multilateral conflict that is lacking a simplistic good-guys-vs-bad-guys framework that Trump might understand. Instead, the players are all bad, and many of the players and their motives are the predicted fallout of the Iraq War (in which Iran was the biggest geopolitical winner). Perhaps the only upside of this mess is that Steve Bannon and the white nationalist fringe seem to have lost some of their White House power.

0,"I fully support the farming renaissance that is underway in Hawaii. HFUU is doing terrific things to promote sustainable ag. Some points: - One reason ag has declined in Hawaii is that imported food is so cheap. Higher prices won't make shoppers happy, but they would do a lot for farmers. - For many people here, the staple food is spam and rice. How is Hawaii going to produce that? - Maui has 36,000 acres that just came out of cane. If there ever was an opportunity to grow farming for food, it is now. - If we want to feed Hawaii, thinking in terms of 1-2 acre farms is a hard way to proceed. We need to supply COSTCO, Safeway and Walmart. They require huge volumes. - The article talks about water shortages. From what I can see, the move is to """"indoor"""" farming, using optimal lighting (powered by PV) that saves 98% of the water used in conventional ag. Crops grow 24x7 with no pesticides/herbicides/fertilizer. """"Fields"""" can be stacked vertically, saving land. Can this work for Hawaii?

0,"It is called """"Pro LIFE"""".  Lots of families are on waiting lists for adopting a baby or child, why are their taxes paying for abortions?  Sounds like throwing away money, especially with the aging population it would be good to encourage young women to give the gift of life and share this gift with those parents that cannot have children for whatever reason.  I think that the Pro Life people make some very valid points and it is pretty disgusting to see a slaughtered feotus, much rather see pictures of families with their adoptive child(ren).  Also, it is very hard on women to go through an abortion, there is a psychological cost, an emotional cost to abortion.  If you support abortion you should also support cutting taxes because there is not enough young people to pay for the current babyboomer generation that brought upon us our current expensive government and social programs.

I'm reminded of that because I suspect these """"serves him right for having attitude"""" commenters  - have never been in a situation where they could face arrest or detention for doing absolutely nothing wrong.

Your Governor Brown can help by joining California and getting out of the USA and starting their own country or better yet join up with Mexico. That should be easy as California is mostly populated with their citizens already. Then they can build a wall and keep the rest of us out.

0,"By putting ballots in the hands of a third party, the Postal Service, and doing that twice for most people, you're increasing the odds for human error. Throw in a fourth party for some ballots that are retrieved or delivered by a spouse or other relative who may not have the voter's best voting interest in mind, or may just forget to retrieve or drop off the ballot in time. Address changes and deaths add complexity to the issue. And then by putting the election three weeks ahead of time for some people, encouraged to vote early by articles in the Register-Guard about voter turnout, you're changing the dynamics inappropriately.

0,"When looking at open interest on futures exchanges by accounts that are registered as speculators as opposed to hedgers, it is important to look at trailing 1 to 200 day momentum.  The vast majority of speculators are  trend followers that trade based on laddered models of priced declines in this case.  The large ones are well knows such as Winton or AHL, but there are literally thousands of such players.  One Deutsche Bank platform gives investors access to over 150 trend followers alone.  They use leverage, build covaraince based risk systems to use leverage and may be as big as $500 billion in assets now.  This means that there in not much information in the open interest number, except as reminder we were at 76 cents last summer.  Sure, there are some macro funds that may have a position, and some small cowboys too.  But the history of trading CAD on fundamentals is not good.  Further, it is a risk on trade meaning it is a trade associated with good news, so not very diversifying.

Both Alaska’s senators voted in support.  Repeal of the ACA begins the process of dismantling Medicaid.  Neither Murkowksi nor Sullivan are making public pronouncements promising to protect Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.

0,"All types of investments go up in the long run for a simple reason - the value of money has been constantly decreasing for centuries.  This is simply because some level of inflation is normal and healthy for an economy (deflation is far worse).  So it should not surprise that house prices increase in the long run, but being fairly low risk investments they usually do not do much better than inflation (recent bubble excluded) for the simple reason that their intrinsic value generally does not increase (a single family home built in 1920 still houses a single family in 2020).  However compare what 100% ownership in Apple would be worth to you in 1980 vs what it would be worth to you today.  The intrinsic value of stocks increases more rapidly than homes in the long run as companies produce things and grow in value.  Yes they swing up and down more with fear and confidence is assessing value and profitability, but in the long run they grow the most.

Politicians and judges are bought and paid for by the rich. Voter turnout is at record lows and yet, the Trump got elected with almost three million fewer votes than Clinton. Police practice brutal systemic discrimination. Governments run unsustainable deficits and yet public infrastructure is woefully inadequate. Trumps behavior is disgraceful. But, American civil society is in such a state of degradation that one in three Americans think Donald Trump is a good President. That is the real story. It too hard to imagine the U.S. ever coming back from this sorry state. The election of Donald Trump means the end of the United States, perhaps not as a country, not yet anyway, but certainly as a world power. Nature abhors a vacuum. The demise of the U.S. creates and global power vacuum and substantial instability for everyone.

It would be perfectly sensible for Canadians to have a republican form of government but we don't.  It would be perfectly sensible if we had to have to have a monarchy that we at least have a home grown one.  But history has created other realities and untangling them to allow a more perfect, logical, sensible system of a US, France etc., as M Boisvert points out, can't and won't happen.  Many in Quebec (French Canada if you prefer) choose to obsess about it while many in English speaking Canada recognise the curiosity of what history has handed out and, as we grow up, become indifferent about it. Some of us even find it satisfying that our constitutional monarchy, as weird as it is, has created a pretty decent country when compared to more logical expressions elsewhere.

0,"Toast  The issue wasn't that they discovered or disciplined the brokers involved immediately.  In fact, they did.  The issue is that they didn't immediately disclose that fact. Actually, if you read their 2014 year end statement and the MD&A that was released in Feb of 2015 they blamed the drop in 'originations' on seasonality, the weather etc.  This in fact was not true and the board knew this as they were in the process of severing ties with brokers that had falsified documents.  National Instrument 51-102, 'Continuous Disclosure Obligations', Section 7 clearly spells out what the board's obligations were.  As soon as a material change occurred, the board had to immediately release that information publicly and fill out a 'material change report' and file it with the OSC.  They did not do this ergo the issue with the OSC.  The OSC wasn't informed until one of the board members went to the OSC later that year.  My question is, why did it take the OSC two years to lay charges?

On the one hand, women certainly appear perfectly capable of filling the role, better than men in some aspects of the job. On the other hand, there appear to be clear biblical restrictions against women teaching men in that setting.  The OT has an example of a woman who was the Judge of Israel (Deborah in Judges 4 and 5) at one point in their existence. There aren't any negative references to her ability to do the job. On the contrary, she seems to perform admirably in the role.  Are the NT injunctions against female pastors and overseers purely a remnant of a social restriction that is now redundant? Or do the still obvious personality differences between women and men indicate that we should still adhere to the biblical admonition? I don't know how to add it all up, Nora!

You claim that the left """"sells the tents of their politics as the gospel of modern morality"""" but fail to admit that conservatives sell their politics as the gospel of status quo or golden age (the past through rose colored glasses) morality. The term """"progressive"""" is also an apt description of the lefts social views, where conservative social views tend to, again, have a status quo or golden age (regressive) orientation. As for the branding of conservative positions as """"racist"""", well, sometimes they actually are racist, but it's true that sometimes it's used to shut down debate, but conservatives use fear of change the same way.

It would be interesting to consult a canonist, but it seems that he holds the view that there are specific, defined impediments to contracting Matrimony, and specific processes for litigating those impediments, outside of which there can be no remedy -- especially what Pope Francis calls a pastoral remedy -- precisely because there are no defined criteria unless there is a formal process.  I think the whole business is Byzantine (apologies to the Byzantines in our midst), but it appears Burke sublimates the pastoral to the juridical -- which, unfortunately, is what Canon Law has done for many centuries.

As harsh as that sounds, it's hard to imagine men of good heart    not wishing to embrace accountability, given the damage the refusal to do so has and CONTINUES to do to the church.  The sad truth is that the longer this goes on, the harder it is to see a path forward for the church towards any kind of a future where it would be relevant in the world.

0,"""""Uttering Threats"""" is clearly defined as a criminal offence according to the Criminal Code of Canada with a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. Which means our justice system does indeed police speech and has for a long time. It is a crime because a threat in itself creates fear in the victim and is therefore a harmful act. Hate speech is is an implied threat to do harm and has the same effect on its victims as a direct threat. Therefore universities and other institutions have a right and responsibility to control such speech, even if it becomes difficult and complicated at times.

Sentence two: """"Well this is awesomely excellent, house prices are skyrocketing and wow, with so many billions still to be spent by businessmen working overseas and wanting to buy here, the government should do something to quickly increase the number of new houses being built so we can sell more and get even more rich on commissions"""".`  Gee, guess which sentence they picked?

0,"Hello ArtEndsemble,  Wrong, I did not change my thesis. My thesis was about fanciful works of fiction, and I named two: Works by Atwood and Clancy. And when another post writer brought out works of non-fictional material (e.g. assassinating Bin Laden in a Pakistan hideout), I stepped forward to emphasize that my thesis was about fanciful works of fiction. It was pretty clear, though, in my original post, given that I was talking about writers choosing villain types from a menu of possibilities.  Your comment is not compelling, about Clancy's fiction having an authentic feel, since Jurassic Park and Avatar also have authentic feels. Good fiction is like that, grounded in real-world concerns like profit and environmentalism and what have you. The functionally important feature, though, is that as a fiction writer you decide if your environment villain will be an outer space mining company, or a dinosaur genetic engineer industrialist, or a radical Christian, or a radical Muslim.

0,"Many state lotteries (WA lottery included) have never been dedicated solely to education funding. Many people (myself included) thought that the WA lottery was created to fund education, but the bills that were proposed in the 1970's in the WA legislature, did not pass. The first successful move toward dedicating lottery funds for education came on Nov. 7, 2000 when Initiative 728 was approved. This measure redirected part of the lottery revenue to the Student Achievement Fund, which was created by the initiative to reduce class sizes. There have been diversions of those lottery funds to the state's general fund due to projected and real budget short-falls.  Is it possible that the WA State Lottery could be used to fully fund or even have a major impact on education funding in our state? The answer is a resounding """"No""""!

MX is finally eating into 60-200K market as well, and it appears that M3 will destroy the 30k sedan market and above. As to solar, SC has 1/3 of the solar market AND is now producing their own solar panels that are cheaper than anything on the market ( and that was before China is hit for dumping ).

The """"Sanctuary City"""" concept is one adopted and embraced by law enforcement, for the purpose of enhancing law enforcement capabilities.  The theory goes, if elements of the community are hesitant to call on law enforcement, report crime, or simply engage due to fears of immigration related consequences, law enforcement becomes ineffective as to a portion of the population.   The policy makes sense.  Give the police the ability to police effectively.  Let ICE and Homeland security deal with the immigration issues.  policies that cut off ANY sector of the community from local police are foolish.

0,"A few corrections needed.92% of the Hospital District Tax provides a fund to help islanders pay their hospital bills. This was set up in a early amendment to the contract between the district and PIMC to help islanders. The $50,000 recently carved out from the hospital tax is also to be used for islander needs per the Third Amendment to the Subsidy Agreement. Women's reproductive care is currently provided by PIMC contracted providers, San Juan Healthcare, our County Health Department and PP. No deficits in women's healthcare are identified in our community. Abortion can not be safely performed in our rural community so take it out of the equation. There are however other healthcare needs in our community that are not provided by PIMC and therefore do not conflict with the Hospital District Contract with PIMC. Don't be misled by Commissioner Williams' shell game used to confuse us as to which  community health programs need our tax dollars. Look around, we know better.

I've been biking on trails around Lane County and Oregon for 30 plus years, many of them multiple times a year. I haven't seen degradation.  I have witnessed hundreds of miles of trails being maintained by bicyclists who love and respect them and work to improve instead of demish their integrity. Access to biking on wilderness trails would bring resources to the wilderness area trail systems. Also, these trails are tough and only the strongest, most disiplined, respectful bicyclists would frequent them. Opening these trails up would bring financial resources to the local economy through increased tourism. Opening up wilderness trails for the people is the right thing to do providing that we stick to the intent of the original 1964 law. Thanks the opportunity to share my personal view on this matter. I believe that Kenedy nailed it with his space on fear. The only thing...

It is pretty interesting that APHA ans Safari Club have such big dogs in this fight. Hardly subsistence user advocates.  I have lived here a long time, Nate. The balance is not there, the fair chase is waning...back in times of true subsistence there were no bag limits, no seasons. We are now in modern times. Rules are needed, something you understand fully as a member of BoG.  I see no way anyone goes hungry without the banned practices.

China is an exception because their economy is not open.  There is actually no reason to treat Mexico in this manner.

0,"IRT kuroiwaj, I see no contradiction between the two paragraphs.  The first paragraph points out that the professionals that Trump has hired are bound by a code of ethics to be confidential with Trump's tax information.  Because they are hired by Trump they will present Trump in the best light possible.  Confidentiality also means you cannot reveal questionable dealings or transaction (squeal) to the authorities unless of course your client wants you to.  So in other words these professional have a conflict of interest because they are being paid to represent Trump.  So their assurances are kind of meaningless.  Got it?  The second paragraph is pretty self explanatory.  Trump promised to release his returns and he says there is nothing wrong with them.  If so then why not release them?

Her fellow officials from other towns are on record that she has not been involved in meetings to coordinate with FEMA, and she admitted it to Stephanopoulos.  Assuming Puerto Ricans are lazy? I never said anything such thing. Maybe you should wait to get facts behind the Trump tweet before making assumptions. That's what I recommended in asking what you know about what is going on.

We also knew that those people, unfortunate enough to belong to another Church (all heretical) would be condemned to hell, no matter how exemplary the lives they lived.  On one hand, there is a loving God who loves us, cares for us, and wants heaven for us, but on the other hand, that same God would send people to hell because they belonged to the wrong club.  What if our own parents were Lutheran, or Reformed, or belonged to any other Church?  We would be condemned simply because we took the faith of our parents.  Our individual theology was skewed to justify our observance of the """"right"""" way.  Many people leave the RCC because they are disillusioned with their childhood Church.

I think we should send China a notice before we do anything: if you are not able to rein in your thug; we will do it for you. One thing I am sure is China will not start a war with us. Militarily, they are still way behind us and they know it. Another reason is that more than 50% of their top leaders' 2nd generation is living in the U.S. with their wealth. Moreover, we are still their biggest market where majority of their wealth comes from. Anyway, NK is considered a cancerous tumor by most of the free world, it should be no problem diplomatically if we take them out.

You seem to think there's little to no cost involved. About 5000 migrants arrive in Cape Town a month, poor and seeking jobs and social services, most from the EC where it does not exist or failed. The city/province has long complained it's importing other province's problems and needs more national funds but the ANC wants to 'punish' the DA and leaves allocations unchanged. (Gauteng has similar problems, though.) No city anywhere, incl in the developing world, can accommodate migration like this and the consequent demands for jobs and services.

Amazing but not surprising, the very people who were most in favor of the old formula """"Rome has spoken, the matter is settled"""" were the ones who questioned it loudest. Things really had changed in the Church. These voices for Church authority wanted a little democracy.  And they were right. In my diocese, there was no effort to get ready, no study of the thinking behind the changes, no patient listening to objections. The priests were given no guideline. We simply turned the altar around and began to celebrate in English, some of us in the same rapid-fire """"celebration"""" that we had performed in Latin.

Jesus called himself the Good Shepherd, the Way, the Truth and the Life.  He permitted himself to be called Rabbi/Teacher.  But he never called himself a Priest.  Nor did he ordain his followers as such.  If one studies early Church history---one sees that the people elected/chose their bishops, their popes, and their presbyters for the liturgy.  This lasted until just after the Edict of Milan in 311 AD.  When the church became acceptable to the Roman emperor [Constantine] and a state religion, the liturgy was moved out of the home, into a church---and a clergy [male] was developed.

Reviving the PCs is not a viable option.

The reason he will be the President is because of the incompetence of the previous administration - and the downward spiral of America's economy and its place in the world. Trump is full of himself and full of bluster.......but the issues are clear and he has tapped into them. Illegal immigration is a perfect example. Too many come in and don't leave - some commit crimes and they should be booted. Will he build a wall? Of course not - but he WILL address the ISSUE! When you want to move three steps forward - go overboard and  say you're taking 10 steps so the media shout that the sky is falling (like right now).. Then those three steps don't look so bad at all - and you've addressed the ISSUE! Trump is crazy like a fox - a master at misdirection. Forget about how much you might not like him - and concentrate on the ISSUES.

1,"The tactical part about using the media, and turning the public against the media, that's just a small part of why he came out on top.  I think he tapped a nerve in american sentiment.  Particularly, the whole election can be summarized in what happened in 5 states.   Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa.  All other states he won were more or less leaning republican, even Florida, North Carolina, we could see that most years, they do have a republican bias.  Trump hammered the same message to those 5 states repeatedly in his rallies.  The media refused to acknowledge that he had any message, and only covered the choice awkward or un-PC soundbites.  And hence he was able to show his crowd that the media was against him.  Viewed from a worldwide view, Trump is part of a global wave that is pushing back against inept leaderships in western democracies.  It is a backlash against the economic injustice that arose after globalism outsourced factory jobs and killed their towns.

Reducing Canada's contribution to GHG's emissions are almost completely symbolic and the real cost to the lives of Canadians is massive.  Very few people will object to initiatives that will reduce emissions and improve our air quality. However, a carbon tax is not nearly the only possible solution.  A very large majority of people do not agree that our economy can withstand the tremendous cost of the proposed carbon tax.

Feeling entitled has been her history from cattle futures, to replacing employees at the Washington Travel office with cronies, and the list goes on to what helped her lose the election....an illegal private server....and she even felt entitled to lie about the whole thing.  The choice of evils is that we now have another """"entitled"""" person in the White House. And our politicians in Washington have long entitled themselves to perks above and beyond......

I like to be compassionate to those who are struggling honestly to improve their lives. To say there is a sigma around taking drugs is to belittle the issuse. Drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and even alchol, if taken too much, are dangerous. Persons addicted to a drug are sick persons, and they are on a downward path. I would hope each person is given a couple of opportunities to honestly face his issues, and to turn around his life. But, the answer is not more government policy. It is religion. These persons need to find God, or a 12 step program, or a psychology in which they begin to take responsibility for their lives. It is a  dangerous world we live in. And, what is the purpose of the high number of deaths? It is a warning to other addicts, that there is danger about. Those I feel sorry for, are parents hearing of a death of a child

The toxic materials were described as bitumen, naphthenic acids, cyanide and heavy metals.  That's why ducks who land on those ponds tend to die. Clean-up technology may be evolving, but real issues do exist there.  There are costs and benefits to any industry, and we have to be realistic about difficult issues and clean-up costs.

1,"Donald Trump’s speech in Poland may have attempted to camouflage its Fascist undertones with some Nazi-bashing, but no one will be fooled. The speech was probably shaped by alt-Neo-Nazi Steve Bannon, White House strategist and enabler of the white supremacist roll of toilet paper known as Breitbart.  Like all Fascist speeches, it configured the Fatherland as weak and a laughingstock, threatened imminently with being wiped out. It is this paranoia and poor self-image that drives Fascist aggression.  Above all, Trump upholds the values of fear, timidity and paranoia. A small radical fringe in the Muslim world cannot menace America’s civilization. But a far right white nationalist president with serious mental issues can.

0,"Criminals are never responsible for their actions according to liberals.  Liberals believe we would not have criminals if there was no poverty.  Thus--the fault of criminal behavior is never the criminal--it is everyone else.  The ironic thing is that liberals hate the police, but they realize we need them to enforce the liberal policies they come up with.  Thus, when police officer cites someone for standing 10 feet near a building and smoking, that is a good police officer.  When an officer cites someone for leaving their car run, that is a good police officer.  When an officer shoots someone because they have a knife and refuse to drop it--then start running towards the officer, that is a bad police officer.  When police officer shoots someone who refuses to drop a gun and points it that them, that is a bad police officer.  They are doing that because there is poverty and climate change.  The police should arrest us, not them--for allowing poverty and climate change.

The report of their meeting notes: """"The obscurity of the Bank of Canada’s new 'CPI-common' measure of core inflation bothered several members, especially given its recent weak readings."""" So while Dave was not upset by the replacement of the CPIX measure of core inflation with this much inferior measure, it is obvious that some members of the Monetary Policy Council were.  For November, CPI-common's 1.3% inflation rate was not only the lowest of any of the Bank's core inflation rates, but it represented the lowest inflation rate for the CPI-common series since March 1995.

One could argue that many of the advances in our society are a direct result of the masculine behaviour of taking risks in the pursuit of knowledge or other gain.  There are certainly some men that exhibit extremely anti-social behaviour, such as described in the article.  To then generalize by stating that all masculine behaviours are anti-social is demeaning to all men who behave themselves.
