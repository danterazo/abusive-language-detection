0,"The project can continue--just under a new government in 2019-one that avoids Quebec and their back stabbing ways mixed with sewage dumping and goes through Maine to Saint John and Eastport Maine. We need access to the Atlantic to sell our oil and supply Atlantic Canada. Trans Mountain will likely be dragged out in the courts by the BC NDP and Liberal free spending drive up the deficits to many more billions. I think we need Brad Wall--does not speak French- not important anymore and the Conservatives can get a majority without Quebec- who can leave any time they want with 25 % of Canada's debt and Coderre can become the Joker King of the republic of Quebec with his Mafia buddies.

0,"Les Gara and the rest of Alaska's Far Left wants an Alaska future with just tourism and government, they want to kill the mining and forest industry with excessive regulation, they want to tax the oil and gas industry into oblivion, they want to tax working Alaskans with a punitive state income tax until we leave the state.  In the Far Left's Alaska we will have a huge state government with public union employees living off the Permanent Fund earnings and a regulated tourism industry with everyone living in a high-rise apartment building downtown.  Les Gara and his Far Left friends want to destroy the Alaska we love.  They cannot stand the independent Alaskan, but has a need to control everyone around them to live the life they decide.

0,"IRT Stanislous, wow, $150 drop per month?  How much do you pay?  Our total electric cost is at $100 per month without solar.  And, I've been pushing mini-nuclear power plants for an Island State as is Hawaii for years following a number of Metal Trades Conferences with the Energy Dept. discussing mini-nuclear power plants.  The State of Hawaii must move in the mini-nuclear power plant direction to get the State of Hawaii off fossil fuel and in the direction of clean energy at under $0.10 per Kwh.  Thanks for sharing.

0,"Under the morality umbrella that Homer-Dixon uses, is it moral for political leaders to enact tax that they will never have to answer for in their lifetime. or ours ? Is it moral that the poor being the most vulnerable, will pay, and we then tell them that they won't see the benefits, but that it is the right thing to do ? Is it moral to tell everyone that this is the right thing to do, when there is no evidence that it is ? Is it moral to adversely label everyone who questions the validity of using money, as the answer to changing the world's climate ? Finally where is the humility in accepting that the earth and its climate is bigger then all if us, and is not subject to the ultimate arrogance of man, that although there are many things we can't do, somehow we have the ability to control the world's climate. Decades from now this will probably be the central theme when they write about this period, how man thought he had climbed so far, that he had the power to control the world.

0,"It shouldn't.  The expense and time alone would make complaints prohibitive.  Not to mention trial judges not experienced in human rights law (think about the Justice Robin Camp experience for what happens with judges not familiar with the context.)  Hard to imagine in what respect your friend thinks courts would be better.  Human rights tribunals have changed immensely, in Ontario almost 10 years ago. They now operate in quite a similar matter to courts.  In Quebec, human rights cases are heard by a panel of three, one of whom is a judge of the Quebec Court who acts full-time on the Human Rights Tribunal.  The other two are not judges, but lawyers.  By the way, the vast majority of legal cases in Canada are heard by tribunals, not courts.

0,"My daughter has been at EWS for 3 years and it has been a really positive experience.  While limiting screen time is encouraged, I know there are families with screen policies across the spectrum at EWS. Some families have no screen time at all while others go see movies regularly and have iPads for their kids. Parents are trusted to make the best decisions they can for their families. My daughter uses black crayons at home (because sometimes you just need to draw a black cat or a spider!) and reads chapter books (she's 8 years old). She has celebrated Rosh Hashanah before because a couple students in her class are Jewish and the parents wanted to bring in latkes for everyone, and it's really a very multicultural and tolerant place where all the world's faith traditions are learned about. In my experience it is very forward-thinking in that regard. Our daughter is happy there and learning lots—intellectually, socially, physically. It's a good place :)

0,"Mahalo Ian Lind for the catch of another illegal Hawai'i State Government without a Treaty of Annexation able to sneak into the legislation HB Bill 1469 to continue to find ways to steal the promised Crown Lands for the native Hawaiians. Because UH did not follow the permit laws and the supreme court ruled UH  need to revisit and apply for a new TMT permit. The law makers have figured out to amend the laws to allow the state to find a process to own the Crown Land someday.  Hawai'i State Government from day one continues to destroy and desecrate for the greed. These are the times Poli'ahu and Pele need to send a ho'ailona, confirmation sign, these lands are Kapu.  The IHSG received license to steal when the illegal occupier USA turned over the control of Hawaiian Crown Lands in 1959 when Hawai'i became an Illegal State.  USA Government prior to statehood protected the Crown Lands. USA established the perfect process to steal more land by approving Hawai'i Statehood.  Sad!

0,"Thank you, Bob for your article.  There are definite gaps in how the system is suppose to work.  Schools need to report, period.  It is not their job to investigate.  Leave investigation to police and CPS.  Schools must assure parents and children that the environment is safe.  When a complaint of sex abuse is made against a teacher...it is automatic suspension with leave from the campus, and no contact with students.  Things get murky when schools try to render a judgement as to whether a complaint is credible or not, avoid calling in the police and end up protecting the teacher-employee over the safety of students.  Despite criminal background checks that may not tell the whole story...we need to teach children boundaries (physical and emotional) from authority figures.  Authority figures never have the right to invade your personal space.  Parents need to be aware when  teachers or other authority figures give special attention that could be """"grooming"""" for sexual abuse.

It's a hard lesson learned every day by stranded motorists and victims of accidents or crimes forced to wait, wait, wait on lonely Oregon roads for the arrival of what over 30 years has become something of an endangered species—a state police trooper. It's time to admit to and fix the mistake made in 1980, when Oregon voters cut the state police from the gas tax. If it made sense then, before the property tax limitation Measure 5 dumped responsibility for schools onto the state's general fund, it sure doesn't now."""" http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/02/put_state_troopers_back_on_the.html

How is Trump's nativism any different than Bibi's? Netanyahu privately has said there will never be two states. For the record, I wish I could vote for Bernie for President. I would love to see that Jewish man in the White House. My comment isn't anti-Jewish, but is instead anti-hypocrisy.

He """"knew better"""" what to do and he would do it as soon as he got into the Oval Office.  But it's been two months and all he's done is to ask the generals to give him their plan.  Okay, let's unpick that, along with his reported statements during the campaign about using nuclear weapons.  I'd say the """"secret plan"""" was a surprise nuclear attack on Raqqa, where the ISIS leadership is holed up.  I'd say he wanted to order that attack in his first week on the job, but the generals told him it would be a war crime that would kill hundreds of thousands of civilians, and they wouldn't do it.  But now Trump has suffered humiliation. Maybe his diminished political capital won't let him build his wall or cut taxes.  He needs a big success.  And there's Frank with the nuclear football.

This is just another example of what is wrong in this country we fight to raise the debt limit but do nothing to work together making sure any increase in the debt limit is smaller the next because we have proposed and actually cut government spending. I doubt there will ever be a real immigration reform. No conservative, if they want to be reelected, is going to vote for an amnesty first with empty promises of border security in the future Maybe!

0,"For those reserving the exact same spot, as in a public space fronting one's home, I believe a case can be made of this as it will be easy to prove. As far as the ones who reserve spaces in varying locations from day to day, I doubt HPD has the manpower to investigate each and every single incident of this nor do I think our courts should be overburdened with parking violations at the taxpayers expense if it comes down to fines, as it will be difficult to prove unless a policeman witnesses such a person reserving the space with cones, then removing the cones and parking in the space and finally testifying in court about it. So I'm wondering, if it's illegal to use cones etc. to cone of spaces, what if such items are simply treated as litter, and thus be discarded by city crews? That would be a pretty good deterrent as a 28"""" traffic cone retails for around $20.00, so a scofflaw using two or more of these cones to privatize a public space ain't cheap if they get discarded often.

And why, because we reward people on assistance when they have more children.   All you have to do is look around in ANY town or city in Canada to know this is true. And what happens, the children have learned off the parents.  So by all means change the constitution if that is what it takes to end this unfairness; btw 1982, so 34 years ago and that was considered over due..but since then, new kids, new generations and they get the free ride why?

Certainly, Cali's economy is huge, and feeds so many people, and is a beacon of progress and people that live there are constantly innovating.   Why people in that state count less than people in Wyoming for choosing a POTUS is a historical accident, if you ask me. Wyoming already gets two senators, this should be enough.

0,"That's twice that Rich Hill has almost pitched a perfect game as a Dodger, and both times Dodger fans have been left with a sick feeling over it. Last night, however, I would give some credit to the Pirates, who made the plays the when they needed to, their pitcher getting out of trouble several times.  That said, a memo to Dodgers manager Dave Roberts: when you pitcher is pitching a perfect game and the score is 0-0, and you have the league's leading hitter sitting on the bench, maybe use him as a pinch hitter, especially when there are runners in scoring position, inning after inning. Then put him on the field, at 3rd base, so that his backup doesn't make an error in the 9th and kill the perfect game.  The good reverberation for Rich Hill is that he increased (and perhaps dramatically) his chances of getting a postseason start, if everyone else is healthy.  There is clearly a dogfight there.

0,"Loren, I wonder if you're being a bit melodramatic in suggesting that our non-combatancy stance is firmly rooted in scripture. And what a fundamentalistic false choice! - patriotism vs God's Word.  The social justice gospel depends upon coercion, by gunpoint if necessary. Do you just want non-Adventists to do the dirty work of enforcing justice? While Jesus eschewed the use of force to advance the Kingdom while He was on earth, He also seems to foresee a time when He will be gone, and His followers will need to use force to defend themselves. He tells Pilate, """"If my Kingdom was of this world, my servants would fight."""" Could He be suggesting that in the kingdoms of the world, where we must render to Caesar, combatancy may be a necessary evil?  It strikes me that those who find no Biblical support for a doctrine of male headship or creation literalism should be careful about reading their own biases into scripture. If our SDA uniqueness depends on our doctrines, we're in big trouble.

If these priests weren't gay, then guess what?   There likely wouldn't have been a clerical sex abuse scandal of anywhere near the scope of what actually transpired.  But NCR and other progressives are determined to imply that the fault lies elsewhere.   The cardinals, the bishops, the Vatican, the committees, while pretending that homosexual priests weren't the principle cause of the scandal.

But the point I was making is that the West and East Coasts export a surplus of money, and that the South and the flyover states get that surplus, thus are welfare states overall. Considering that, it would be painfully ironic if the federal government refused to return funds that originated primarily in the productive states that subsidize the rest of the country.

0,"One common misconception regarding college algebra is that you learn the basic arithmetic mentioned by the author in that class. As a college math professor for ten years, who has taught college algebra countless times, I am very familiar with the standard curriculum of a college algebra course. The course revolves around learning different families of functions, such as exponential, rational, logarithmic, etc. A quality course will spend a lot of time on modeling using each of these function families. For a more informed understanding of the current college algebra curriculum and the change in it's direction, read articles on """"a modeling approach to college algebra"""". Regarding the alternative courses that are taught, these cover many applicable topics in math that very few people are exposed to, such as financial math, logic, and graph theory. My opinion is that these topics are just as important as those taught in college algebra and should be considered as a viable math alternative.

We have a University system that we cannot afford, we have an education system that is far too expensive and needs to be reigned in, and there are some additional cuts to State Government that can and should be made.  That said, I am in agreement that we cannot simply cut our way out of our problem. The PFD checks should end or be reduced to a level that we can afford, and we should allow the Permanent Fund to continue to increase in size until it can support State Government going forward. If it takes an income tax in addition to deleting the PFD to get there then I am fine with that.

Man can use the world's resources and at the same time maintain the environment - these goals are not mutually exclusive as most hard core environmentalists would make us believe. Priorities need to be established with regards to projects such as the pipeline East. Do we as Canadians prefer to buy oil for our East coast refinery from Saudi Arabia (blood oil) or would we prefer that Eastern Canada buy Alberta's oil therefore providing jobs and prosperity to Albertans as well as to all of Canada. Common sense and reason would dictate that Eastern Canada use Alberta's oil, unfortunately most environmentalists would disagree, for reasons I could never hope to understand.

Your proposal is stupidly punitive, singling out a group whose actions benefit our society and automobile drivers.  3) Colorado's image as an outdoor recreation Mecca, which includes being a cycling friendly state, is a huge economic draw.

Oh, and if Trump imposes tariffs on anyone, wages and the cost of living in the US are going to rise a heck of a lot faster in that country than in Canada.

0,"The """"Pay yourself first"""" model as it is explained in this article is only effective if any of your debts are not interest-bearing or you simply don't have any debts at all.  As soon as  you have interest-bearing debt like mortgages, car payments, and *especially* if you're getting charged monthly interest fees on your credit card you are actually ripping yourself off if you put aside ANY money before paying off those loans.  And the reason for that is because there's no 'savings' that earns anything near what even the outstanding balance on a mortgage is costing.  If you want to put aside money for emergencies (only!) that's one thing.  But if you think you're 'paying yourself first' by putting money into hyper-low savings accounts when you have ANY outstanding interest-bearing loans then you've got it completely opposite of what it really is that's going on.

Tom indicated that both the Australian and American bishops had been """"retired"""" (stood-down) and that Archbishop Diarmuid Martin was the only man left in place.  Diarmuid Martin had a diplomatic career and was the Vatican's rep at the U.N. when he was returned to Dublin, to replace Cardinal Desmond Connell ; who as an ultra conservative,  had mishandled the clerical abuse scandal.  The Judicial Review Report into the Dublin Diocese was extremely critical of him. He was the Cardinal who defined the """"Mental Reservation"""" tool, to the Judicial Review.

0,"The CBO essentially is repeating the comments it had for the previous version by trying to scare us by saying """"24 million"""" would lose coverage.  Compared to what you ask?  Well, Obamacare started with the """"assumption"""" that there were """"47 million"""" people who had no health insurance.  Obamacare """"covered"""" about """"27 million"""" by expanding Medicaid to pay cover them and raised taxes to pay for this additional cost of around $10 billion.  However, when organized labor (like the ILWU) found out that Obamacare was going to impose a """"Cadillac Tax"""" on their generous union healthcare benefits starting at 40%, the proverbial kukai hit the fan.  So now, the taxes are not being collected to pay for Obamacare and only the Federal deficit is getting bigger.  So what is the solution?  The GOP plan may not be great, but at least is being realistic about the situation.  Meanwhile, the Democrats are starting to line up to support the AHCA, because the imposition of the Cadillac Tax is not happening.

When Jesus lived, was there more than one god? When Jesus died was there just one god again?  The whole point of the Trinity is that Yahweh (OT) is the SAME conscious entity as Jesus (NT) - so that there is only One god. The entity that was Jesus is the same entity that flooded the earth drowning countless numbers: vis Yahweh=Jesus, otherwise there was more than one god entity, for a while, while Jesus was around. But that can't be, because there is only one god? ?? ??  The god to whom Christians pray - Jesus, is the SAME god to whom Jews and Muslims pray - Yahweh (Allah) - the one to whom Abraham spoke. It has to be, how could god (Jesus) not exist before he was born from Mary's womb?  See how simple is the concept of the Trinity?

The only way it's any different is if by buying, you're acquiring more space, which may often be the case but isn't necessarily.  Of course a roof has to be replaced, but in markets other than TO and Vancouver, a purchaser usually considers this in the offer they make on the home. None of this changes the fact that a new purchaser in the market these days should not look to a purchased property to finance their retirement but we should stick to the costs that are unique to buying rather than renting.

Our government already has a vetting process legally established into law for citizens and refugees from other countries to legally gain entry into this country. Donald Trump has every federal agency charged with our national security at his disposal. If  they have given him reason to believe that additional vetting  of the people who wish to enter our country is necessary for our national security then why are they not currently adding what they need to increase our security into law. President  Trump is surrounded by national security experts who have had plenty of time since 2001 to decide what additions to the vetting process we need.  He is not addressing vetting issues by closing our borders to friends ,family, students, refugees and needed employees. The man needs to stop stalling and do his job. Closed borders are not additional vetting. .

However, who does that truly protect? When the victim publicly discloses in the future she or he will likely have no way of authenticating her claims.

Tougher regulations or rules will mean very little if the banking regulator isn't or is unwilling to enforce the law and track what banks are actually doing.  The only way to have a proper and effective situation between a regulator and the industry being regulated is by having the right rules/laws combined with an enforcement mechanism which is effective in detection violations, providing reasonable penalties for any violations and ensuring the regulator is aware of what is occurring in the financial institution on all levels.

It is whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Second, there is a section of criminal code which makes it impossible to consent to sex when extremely intoxicated.

0,"Renewables have two fundamental flaws in them that have been with us since the turn of the last century. First off they are not reliable as base load generation. When a KW is needed on the demand grid, it must instantly be generated for that demand or the lights don't come on. The regulated power base that we all pay for has to double the investment for back up generation such as natural gas fired processes for wind farms. Secondly they are enormously expensive. Wind and solar are heavily subsidized by tax payers and utility rate payers. Wind alone subsidies  in a $2.50/mmbtu natural gas market amount to $6.25/mmbtu in real cost. this is a fact that is conveniently ignored. This hurts Xcel and their power customers because as the rates for power go up, demand destruction kicks in and Xcel is not selling as much power as they need to grow their business to stay in business. Coal will continue to be a huge part of India and China because they are emerging economies and need cheap energy

0,"Memorial day is not for celebrating those who served. It is about remembering those who died during the conflicts.  This article mangles things by focusing on veterans. There is a separate Veterans Day and I would argue it also covers those who died after the conflicts. There is a significant and profound difference between during and after.  It is not a volunteer military that has hurt the service in terms of a disconnect. It is the separate VA system, housing system, and commissary system that has isolated the military from too much of the country. For example, the original purpose of the commissary system was for those who are serving overseas. It was not services in the States. And the VA is a boondoggle. Did we need a separate VA hospital in Aurora when there are twenty other hospitals in the greater Denver area? No. But politicians like Mike Coffman and the rest of Congress make bad decisions and bear responsibility for the cost overruns.

For most, of course, that will be much more than what you saw deducted from your paycheck each month. There's also a small (2%) service charge.  For example, when I became self-employed in 2006, I started paying $1349 per month for my family's coverage: $1339 for the policy plus a $10 service charge. Before that, I saw $232 deducted from my pay each month for exactly the same policy. My employer was paying the remaining $1107 every month.  Today, we have coverage through my wife's employer. For """"family"""" (employee + spouse + children) coverage, the total monthly premium is $1926. Our contribution is $850 and the employer pays $1076. The employer's benefits summary lists a """"COBRA Rate"""" of $1965 for that policy. The $1926 premium plus a 2% service charge.  For the same plan, employee, only, the COBRA rate is $680.

The long term view is of little comfort to those affected in the short term.  10 years is short in terms of society/societal change, but long in terms of the individual directly affected.  On the other hand, most of the articles I read on this subject ignore the wave-like character of technology adoption - there will be many, many places in the world where automation and AI won't reach for a time.

The church will lose a large number of the next generation, not because of a failure to market the product (although the failure is evident) but because of a failure to achieve a necessary level of aesthetic excellence consistent with a living Gospel. A failure of this magnitude will only become apparent to the blind when the church is truly smaller, if not holier, as Benedict would like to see. The sins of the church are very grave. To refuse renewal is to refuse to admit to the need for change-it is, in effect, to say that the church has no need of repentance, that is innocent of the crimes committed. It was always right, always beyond criticism. It is an exercise of idolatry.

Consider a high income earner who works in Alaska and lives outside Alaska.  The majority of what they purchase in Alaska is a minimal amount.

Keep in mind that 2019 is fast approaching and there will be an election at that time - which means that there is lots of time for ordinary citizens to get organized. As someone working in the academic sector, I have no problem with Canadian universities committing to social justice at the expense of other world views. But if they wish to do so, they should do it as private institutions - not ones funded by the Canadian public.

0,"Now,  now,  Ellamae.  You are right.  Even a perfect hermeneutic does not come near doing what is right.  The hermeneutic doesn't glorify God.  But it is the method  we use to understand God's revelation through the scripture.  It makes no sense to read the bible looking for the answer to the question which you have a predetermined answer for already.  The question is,  did  Jesus, Paul,  the NT Church ordain women to leadership?  Did they offer a rationale to explain their actions?  How has the divine revelation been understood in the past?  To hermeneutically explain away the plain meaning of the texts concerning WO lays a foundation to explain away all the distinctive Adventist teachings,  which up until the present have been pretty consistent hermeneutically.  I know 'hermeneutic'  is a fifty cent word,  but it works precisely at the task of explaining the stakes involved in how the questions are both asked and or answered.

0,"Despite her deep resentment of Donald Trump, Alceste is at least beginning to glimpse the reality. Though by denying that the US Congress represents Establishment politics, its clear that her understanding still has some way to go.  Impeaching the president isn't a matter of law that's adjudicated in a neutral court of justice. Quite the opposite. Impeaching the president is first and foremost a political act. Judges don't decide guilt or innocence: politicians vote on the matter. There is no court of appeal.  The vast majority of both Republicans and Democrats are entrenched Establishment politicians. At best they all distrust Trump, probably many of them fear and hate him. Not because he's incompetent- the American system handles incompetent presidents all the time. Rather, they fear Trump because he's not one of them. He's a political outsider, and the US Establishment has little hold over him.

Nothing is new about that. We already know that the external driver will affect ocean temperatures, which in turn will affect air temperatures, but with a different timing. And the cause of long term climate warming is not the work of natural ocean cycles. It would violate the laws of thermodynamics if this happened.

And yes, if you believe the world is 6000 years old, well, you can believe whatever you want. Science is fact, however, and not belief; whether you believe it as fact is irrelevant.

0,"Demanding a comedian put on the face of tragedy and speak in solemn phrases of pop psych jargon is likely to get more laughs from the very people who were Ms Fey's target in the first place.  Please note, Josey Ross, Tina Fey was not seriously advocating sheetcake eating as a social policy. It's a metaphor for how we got here. Honestly, how many Bernie supporters voted for Trump or simply sat at home eating cake last November?  Josey Ross describes herself:  """"As a queer cisgender white woman I aim to work from a place that understands my positionality and uses my sites of privilege in solidarity with others. I use a strengths-based, trauma-informed, intersectional feminist lens grounded in anti-oppression principles.""""  When one talks in jargon and technobabble, the rest of the world tunes out.

In general, most people in Hawaii intuitively understand what 100% clean electricity looks like. Everyone has seen wind mills and solar panels, and it is not a huge mental leap to imagine scaling wind and solar up - and adding a smarter grid and a decent amount of energy storage to achieve 100% clean electricity. Unfortunately, transportation is more complex and there are many more misconceptions about the energy, land use and cost implications of different policies and infrastructure investments.  Here's a few questions I'd like you to contemplate: What % of Oahu residents have driver's licenses?  How much does it cost to own and operate a car annually?  How many parking stalls are needed for each car on the island and how much does it cost to build parking?  How much does it cost to operate TheBus?  What % of Oahu residents today (and in 2030) are over 65?

The only part of that description that is mythical is the unscrupulous salespeople part.  I agree that the majority of sales people are decent and honest people with no intention of harming clients.  The majority of sales people are trained to sell proprietary investment product rather than to provide client specific advice - i.e. your typical sales person has a controlled inventory of investment product to sell with considerably higher fees than alternative but comparable investment options.  In many or even most cases the sales person really doesn't even understand the fee structure much less whether it is expensive.

I can understand the reluctance to the path of government to government relations as per the model offered by the DOI. And, I can understand the reluctance to working within any model that is less that full unbridled independence. What I can not understand is spending one's life holding up the wrongs of the past without offering a vision, a practical, obtainable, vision of how to go into the future. How to solve one's problems. Without one, and the willingness to make the compromises that such a path most likely would require, it seems to me that all the years of protesting, of educating and raising generations on the promise of the possibilities of such a outcome, will be wasted.

The tax returns would demonstrate whether or not that’s actually true.”  The second possible reason is that Trump may have lots of money parked overseas, and if so, this would come out in the returns. “It could be embarrassing.”  Third, it’s possible that Trump’s returns might reveal that he isn’t quite as rich as he likes to claim he is.

The NEB finally agreed to let me take two of its personnel on a tour of the Toronto sites in August 2015.

It seems likely the student over reacted and posted something he quickly regretted after speaking with his attorney father, but was late enough retracting that the University already had a copy and took appropriate action. On the other hand, the student is claiming the University changed the terms of their agreement with him after he had already begun attending classes, which means he had made substantial commitments including paying tuition, leasing accommodations, and moving to Eugene. If he can prove this, he is likely due some damages for their actions, and may be able to successfully assert subsequent actions would not have happened if the University had held to their part of the bargain in the first place. He may have enough of a case that the University will settle to make it go away. After all, they have enough problems already. Others grievance seekers will pile on if the University is not careful.

All things considered however, discount airlines WestJet comes out well above Air Canada on most customer criteria. Anyone who flies regularly is well aware that attitudes at Air Canada are anything but consistent. Sure some are good but far too many - especially older employees - exhibit a take or leave it attitude. WestJet staff are more friendly and accommodating. The main difference, of course, is that one is unionized and the other (so far) is not. WestJet has managed to stave it off by offering competitive pay and benefits.  Unions make great sense in manufacturing and heavy industry. But they don't work well in the service sector - and especially not in the travel and tourism industries. This WestJet pilot showed initiative and sensitivity rarely seen at Air Canada. My compliments!

0,"Alaska oil and gas laws stop Alaskans from competing with the majors and are unattractive to investors worldwide and they need to be fixed!  Maybe the Governor and the Legislature could use the $50 Million that the oil & gas companies paid to the state's """"470 oil spill fund"""" in 1995 with it's 5 cents per barrel tax to pay Lloyd's of London to insure the state of Alaska?  Create a state self insured policy, using the DEC's 3 cents per barrel share to contract with Clean Sea Company instead of letting this money sit wasting away for over 30 year!  No bonds and no 9 month, $80,000 C-Plan are needed,  it is a waste of money and time and keeps investors from drilling for oil & gas in Alaska!  We need wisdom in the Legislature to cause more oil to be produced, right?  The Oil haters and monopoly lovers wrote enough bad oil & gas laws to put the competitors out of business in Alaska, and here we are, why?  Stop the BIG THREE MONOPOLIES & OIL HATERS FROM KILLING ALASKA'S OIL BUSINESS NOW!

0,"The blame for the situation the Broncos are in falls squarely on one persons shoulders : John Elway. His inability to do anything productive with our 2 trashcans, 2 turnstiles and Garrett Boles, AKA our offensive line over the past 3 years is only one of many reasons we are where we are today. His bad choices at QB is yet another reason. Trevor, Paxton and Brock are not starting QB's in the NFL period. By bringing Brock back, the Broncos did one thing and one thing only, take caps space away from where it is needed, the offensive line. This whole season is a comedy of errors so far. A cocky rookie head coach who can't see 2 inches past Trevor's nose, arguably the worst offensive line in NFL history, some of the worst play calling since John Fox and a special teams unit that isnt so special. As a matter of fact, the ONLY good thing Elway has done since taking over is lure Peyton to Denver. Had he not done that, he would be on a very hot seat and probably needs to be.

BBC was also biased against independence, according to an academic survey performed after the fact.  Every day Scots were told (bombarded with media voices and politicians) that independence would mean: the health service would collapse, pensions would disappear, groceries would cost more, and Scotland would be attacked by terrorists.  If it hadn't been for this massive anti-Scottish independence campaign (Project Fear) then I believe Scotland would have voted at least 60% for independence rather than 45% who did in fact vote for independence.

0,"Premier David Peterson predicted carnage for Ontario's economy caused by the implementation of so-called Free Trade. A recession in 1990 coincided with massive economic structural change demanded by Free Trade, making the recession more like a depression, lasting from 1990 to 1995. Remember companies like Gillette and Caterpillar bugging out before the ink dried? The promise of Prime Minister Mulroney to have the world's finest worker adjustment programs? Chretien did not negotiated NAFTA but campaigned successfully in 1993 against NAFTA, promising to kill it without substantive change. Chretien betrayed his electoral platform. Turner correctly pointed out that giving up the economic levers results in the loss of political levers, sovereignty.  Mulroney betrayed Canada's independence and sovereignty whilst temporarily saving his ethically challenged government. Chickens came home to roost with the Progressive Conservative party dying.

And if government is off the people, by the people and for the people then the people should get to decide what government should do. Size should never even be a consideration - it should simply follow logically from the list of tasks the voters have agreed on for government to undertake. If they choose very few, then the government will be small. If they choose large and expansive things - it will be big. In FDR's time the voters chose for government to do lots of very big things - in todays' terms over 3 trillion dollars in massive infrastructure projects for example. Was he some mad powergrabber ? No. He executed the will of the people and ended the great depression in the process. Refusing to do what the people wanted: that would be authoritarianism.

This presumption is nothing less than diabolical for it intervenes against divine inspiration, open and at work in the people, in Nature. The People of God are Church, and it is right that people join in affirming their rightful place in knowing and communicating divinity consciousness. Authentic people-consciousness tends toward unity consciousness in knowing Godlikeness and being Godlike. The One God of all people compels toward Churches United, notwithstanding diversity in ecological evolution and political experience. The common joining of Faith/Hope/Love enlightens ecologically linked life in common God-understanding. Nothing less than this joining can save us from self-consumptive claims on the Sacrament of Natural Order.

Then take our time crafting a bipartisan package, instead of something created behind closed doors and crammed down the people's throats like ACA and the current legislation.

0,"Occam's razor is sometimes to dull a blade. It is an gross oversimplification to characterize our health care problems one of public vs private delivery. Inviting competition will not fix anything. More novel approaches are required. While competition may be useful, it is not the only means of controlling costs. Corporations, especially publically traded ones, do not have a stellar history of balancing the public interest to those of their shareholders. Perhaps a co-operative approach, like mutualized insurance, where the customer is the owner,  might work in some cases. The real problem is one of vested interests, doctors, nurses, administers, bureaucrats, resistant to change, when a  dynamic framework  for change is what is needed most. If private healthcare cannot be stopped, those in it, must be isolated, highly regulated, separated, and taxed, all to support the public system.

Yet many, many Canadians have no healthcare plan, and at best, can only get a modest tax credit for their health care expenditures that fall outside of those covered by their province. The cure would be to tax the plans, or allow those without a plan full deductions against income for health expenses.

0,"Actually, you're missing the role of investment:  if a government runs a deficit now, but the improvements in infrastructure lead to increased revenue in the future, it's worthwhile -- in particular in a context of extremely low interest rates.  Like, for example, the deficit spending to four-lane Highway 1 through Banff (100% federal investment, there), which speeds the delivery of goods to the market.  Governments aren't private firms, so the balance sheet comparison is not really relevant.

0,"Fascinating but shocking reading the perspective of a typical CBC personality. Quinn has worked for the CBC for years. Likely 99% of other CBC workers have the same perspective. The CBC represents MSM in Canada. Likely journalists who work for the BBC or CNN  in the US and U.K. have a similar narrow life experience and perspective: parochially fixated and obsessed with urban social justice  issues. It's no wonder the MSM was caught unaware and asleep  about the Trump victory and Brexit. The MSM like the CBC has NO clue about what 99% of people's concerns, thoughts and ideas are. The CBC is not relevant anymore to what most citizens experiences are. Here we have a popular CBC personality who is not even curious or aware of life outside the downtown street grid.

The problem was started by the NDP who, just prior to being reduced to 2 seats in the election, did an end-around their own bargaining department who wouldn't agree to this deal, and introduced this contract by legislation.  They gave the keys to the treasury to the teachers union.  Good plan politically; it would buy the support of teachers in the election and, if they didn't get elected, hand the next government a bomb with the fuse already lit.   But it was a bad contract economically and philosophically.  It makes no sense to have the union as the final arbiter of class size and working conditions.  Christy Clark's involvement was on behalf of all taxpayers, trying to right the wrong of the NDP and introduce some sanity into workplace rules.

0,"Today on TV I watched a program called """"The Fatal Attraction of Adolf Hitler"""" which sought to provide backdrop for his rise to power. The piece used archival footage of people who were young at the time and one particularly articulate woman stated that she voted for Hitler because she had seen such pitiful poverty in the slums of Berlin during the early years of the Depression and she thought Hitler was the only person to bring them out of their economic malaise. I was struck by that.  I was also struck by how mild Hitler's language was compared to Trump's even during his rantings at the Nuremburg rallies. He talked about the importance of the German people finding their inner strength to pull themselves up. Who wouldn't warm to that kind of talk? Trump is in another league altogether. Hitler may have not have told Germans he planned to round up Jews but Trump is already telling us he'll round up Mexicans and prevent Muslims from entry. And people are still behind him!

Unless of course someone like Robert Mueller manages to obtain subpoena power and forces, say, Deutsche Bank or the Bank of Cyprus to hand over loan information regarding dirty laundered money from Russia which Trump has more than likely obtained directly from Putin himself.  And now we know that Trump, Jr. and Jared Kushner were lured by Russian operatives into meeting with Russian attorneys close to Putin with the express purposes of obtaining illegally-gathered information on Hillary Clinton to be used for nefarious purposes in the campaign.  If Hillary Clinton had won and done 1/100th of the things Donald Trump has done so far the Republican-led Congress would have already impeached her by now. With Trump, however, everything for Ryan, McConnell, et al. is just hunky dory.  Nothing about this is normal. Everything about this is bad. Really, really bad.

Schools are like that also. Public schools must educate all children, which means if a kid comes in with severe behavioral issues then they need to hire someone to watch over them. Private schools don't have this kind of overhead, so can run leaner. Reaching that last house (for mail), or last child (for schools) is disproportionately expensive.

The CPC (and obviously Scheer) arrogantly seem to think that Canadians made a dumb mistake and need to be educated on their mistake by the CPC (repeating the same lines that failed in 2015).    This disrespect of the electorate is one reason they are the opposition.     It still hasn't sunk in that Trudeau didn't so much win the last election as the CPC were rejected.  Scheer needs to up his game and put his stamp on the party (not just wield Harper's old, worn out stamp).    Personally, I think he is incapable.     He's no leader which is why he spent 13 years as an MP (including 4 years as Speaker) yet few Canadians knew his name before he """"won"""" the leadership.

Without some sort of direction, plan, or even an outline of a plan, just getting rid of a Executive Director because the board leadership don't like them is not, in my opinion, the most sensible way to go if the goal is to effectuate change. Successful change requires a vision, and then seeing if the people who are currently in leadership are able to shift their style to the new vision by the new leader.  Effectuating change by just firing everyone is tantamount to what we just went through in the Mayoral race - and the voters didn't buy that message.

There were no supermarkets at all in the downtown (east of Thurlow) 15 or 20 years ago - now at least eight come to mind (2 IGA's, Costco, H-Mart, T&T, Nesters, Choices, and Urban Fare).  And the development at Knight and Kingsway does have a grocery store (a Save-On-Foods). Including a grocery store as part of that large residential development was a demand of the neighbourhood during the rezoning process, despite a restrictive covenant put on a portion of the site by Safeway.  Some individual stores may be closing, but the general pattern in Vancouver is one of increased household-serving retail stores of all types (including food), as virtually all neighbourhoods add density.

The DATA must always be first, and when NEW data emerges, new observations are made, pre-existing theory must be adjusted.  Let's take our understanding of scripture as an example. We have 2000 years of theological writings interpreting every passage in scripture. From time to time, new crucial data emerges that necessitates a revision in our understands.  The two stories of creation in Genesis are perhaps the most obvious, huge, examples. Modern scriptural scholarship has demonstrated that the two stores, if taken literally, are contradictory, and also that the second is perhaps a millennium older that the first. And modern cosmology has made it clear than both stories must be understood metaphorically.  New data requires revised understandings. To presuppose prior conclusions cannot  be overturned by new data is to be UNWHOLE.

In addition, $50,000 was donated to pay for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, another $750,000 will go to fund University of Montreal Faculty of Law. The Globe reports the fundraiser in question also featured the attendance of Shenglin Xian, boss of something called Wealth One Bank, which aims to help Canada’s “Chinese community” with their evidently distinctive banking needs.

Now I cannot get them out at all within a reasonable time, maybe 4 to 8 hours later.  The officers tell me why and it related to having to deal with the same people over and over and they are limited in what they can do now.  Recently had a guy try to steal a customers car, they ram and stood in front of it (wouldn’t recommend that) and the police did arrive quickly on that and gave the theif a ticket.  That was it.  The guy that just killed that paint store owner had been arrested and let go 11 times and on his last release was out in a $250 bail that he didn’t even have to pay.  The paint store owner is now dead, had it not been for the new laws, he most likely would have been in jail.  I doubt his family thinks soft approach on crime is the answer.  Just my opinion though.

They will continue to do so. This includes all taxation; they are using our oil against us in order to take more.  Remember CBC and the footage of cash passing hands?

0,"New York Times April 2015 Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.  As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.

I know several people who have invested a decade or more into acquiring permanent resident status ... not because they were unwilling to put in the effort, but because the process is so backlogged and time-consuming for the average case.

Part time politicians can't properly administer this city, far as I can tell. Thanks for this article, which helps us understand what has happened and what is needed going forward. Your service to this city was exemplary and many of us are grateful that you took time out of your schedule to keep an eye on things. Your district sure seems to produce a lot of very talented people willing to serve. Change can't happen if every district doesn't send in multiple candidates for every office. Otherwise, complacency sets in as there is little risk of being called to task for mistakes.

0,"Kurt, one of the bears you mentioned was a black bear, so you seem to be lumping the two species. Black bears can already be hunted in most of Chugach State Park, including most of the upper Eagle River valley, and most of JBER. Brown bears can already be hunted in most of Chugach State Park, including upper Eagle River valley. Dozens of bears are shot in the Anchorage area every year by hunters, police, Fish and Game, and citizens.  Most hunts are managed to maintain or even increase populations, not to """"thin"""" them. I think you're proposing that both black and brown bears be culled in the Anchorage area. Chugach State Park was created, in part, to maintain wildlife populations, including bears, for human use and enjoyment. Any bear hunts in or near areas populated by humans would be dangerous, both by shots fired by jittery hunters and by wounded bears running from the hunters.

The Fake News loves Trudeau because Trudeau is destroying jobs, incomes and living standards and turning Canada into a high unemployment, low wage wasteland.  The Fake News does not want the average person to enjoy a decent life, so they support Trudeau 100% and ignore Trudeau's lies and lack of ethics and morals.

0,"To get rid of the monster we created. Read the history of the Taliban. We created it to get rid of the Russians. It is one of the problems of arming one group to help us that later shoots back at us with our own arms. We are doing it now in Syria. We armed the Iraqis to defeat the Iranians that were mad at us for supporting the Shah of Iran during the Iraq- Iranian war. We have done it a lot after the Viet Nam """"Police Action"""". Almost all military experts say it is not a good idea to arm insurgents. The main problem I see is after the main action we don't provide any infrastructure help. We always screw up the end game. All we do is create a vacuum that gets filled with radicals. Trillions for arms and not even a billion for schools and hospitals. It might be interesting to note that the Opium production was dropped to zero under the Taliban and right after we went in it was back to 100%. We needed the help of the drug warlords.

0,"Similarly,  a pollster deliberately choosing 12 Clinton Democrats—or 12 Trump Republicans—to poll tells us nothing about the constitution of preference in the population. However, given the ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the population, we might be able to deduce whether the pollster deliberately picked his or her sample rather than drawing them randomly. In the case of the Bible, this deduction cannot be made with statistical significance, because the Bible's heavy preference for mentioning males makes the choice of 12 males just as likely to be without any deliberate intent as intentional.  An interesting side note is that the Bible's very heavy bias mentioning of Jewish people makes the argument that Jesus intentionally selected Jews for apostles also without statistical significance.

Do you settle for $ 10.5 million, or do you continue to litigate, hoping you'll have to pay less (you can't hope to actually win), risking having to pay even more than $ 10.5 million, and your own lawyers, and Khadr's legal fees?  The Conservatives are keen to condemn the settlement. They never said what they would have done instead.  Of course, for the Conservatives, the Supreme Court was wrong, and Khadr's rights weren't violated, and if they were, he's a Bad Hombre anyway and doesn't have any rights. That's why the Conservatives were so consistently unsuccessful in Court: they thrive on emotion, prejudice and contempt.

The question Mr. Gee must ask  is """"Do the people who control supply through zoning and building permits, want the price of homes to go down?"""" The answer is """"no."""" Politicians want the housing prices to go up. House prices go up, people feel richer and vote accordingly; house prices go down 2% each and every year for the next 20 years and people who made bad investments vote for somebody else. Also, cities rely on property taxes, home prices goes up, property tax revenue goes up. Increasing the mill rate is not popular but sucking in more taxes because house prices go up is a pretty slick way to raise taxes. Central planning has failed everywhere it has been tried, fire all city planners and remove all zoning restrictions and the free market will sort everything out.

Khadr's welfare-collecting mom told the CBC she cheered at the television when the death of a Canadian soldier was reported - the entire Khadr family are a disgrace to Canada and their continued presence in this country is a stain on the nation; they should be forcibly removed to Pakistan. Canadian men and women died fighting Taliban cowards and many soldiers are still fighting mental battles and yet our government gives an admitted terrorist $10 million.

He had to give lip service because the mainstream Repub leadership was drooling for Obamacare's repeal.  Trump finally said to those Repubs driving the repeal effort to put up or shut up.  In my opinion, he did so because he did not believe the Repub proposals were an improvement over Obamacare.  There are none so blind as who will not see.

Some people are very wealthy, others aren't. A city contains a wide diversity of incomes. If you raise the property taxes precipitously, you'll wind up losing a lot of people downtown who've been there for decades, that perhaps don't make as much money.  Additionally, go to statscan and you'll see that in 2011: """"By 2011, fewer than one in five (18.9%) people lived in a rural area""""  It'll be even more now.

I communicated my sympathy and he accepted it with grace and without protestations of unfairness, etc.  I consider him a class act......were I talking to him I'd say """"a class act for a Republican"""" and we'd laugh together.

It seems more likely that this visit by a virulent critic of Trump will be seen by the incoming Trump administration as just another slight directed against the President-Elect by the Trudeau Liberals. After all, Trudeau and his henchtthingies disgraced themselves by their thinly veiled anti-Trump  remarks during the presidential election campaign, when Canada’s self-interest demanded a strict neutrality between the presidential candidates.

0,"Your hypothesis is wrong, there is no shortage of rental housing.  Vacancy rates have just recently tightened but the market responded with purpose-built rental construction increasing in the last 2 years by about 2,700 units per year in the Toronto CMA..  My guess is because of rent controls these rental units will be registered as condominiums are completion. But you ignore the other purpose-invested rental housing.  Since 1991 (most in the last 5 years) the Toronto CMA has produced over 160,000 rented condominium units.  Consequently it was only a few years ago there was a surplus of rental units. Why Montreal doesn't have a problem.  First, compared to the GTHA, there hasn't been much growth.  Second the rental board only issues guidelines for the basis of landlord and tenant negotiations of rents.  Only if no agreement is reached will a hearing, be held.  There is flexibility, something Wynne the Destroyer knows nothing about.

He ran right past Watson getting spun and stood there.  Next play, no help at all for Watson.   Watson was struggling all game with Ingram, just got burned, and the next play they leave him on an island.  That was flat out dumb by the staff.  I think this o-line is much better than last year, even though it was their first game.  But, the staff has to help when they can't handle it on their own.  Look at how the Chargers were double-teaming Miller.  I saw none of that with Ingram or Bosa.  Luckily Bolles was good enough to hold up most of the time against Bosa.  Bolles impresses me.

A good leader will delegate strategic roles to those employees who have shown themselves capable.  Equally important, s/he will studiously avoid delegating to those who have not demonstrated sufficient flair.

In many cases, the bankers doing the deals that ultimately tanked the economy had no real skin in the game. Maybe some outstanding options, or some stock, but for the most part nothing. So, if your compensation dictates your behavior, they would be incentivized to take excessive risks. They don't suffer the full consequences when the whole system falls apart, because they've already extracted their bonuses. For top execs who do have stock comp, many of them would get golden parachutes if the company suffered, so even they are covered. If we didn't bail them out, we wouldve likely had a meltdown worse than the great depression. I truly believe we had to bail them out, but that afterward we shouldve broken them up, and gotten a massive equity stake in anyone who got bailed out.

Maybe he's serious about Taiwan and maybe he isn't, but he now he has a lever where before he had none. I doubt if Middle America is hating him for it.  Likewise with Russia. Obama's policy on Russia was old school, Cold War politics. Trump on the other hand is being pragmatic. (Seriously, do Americans care that Crimea left Ukraine and became part of Russia?) At the same time, Trump is inviting Russia back from its shift to closer ties with China, while offering the possibility of cooperation on their mutual problem with Islamic State. Again, other than those with a Cold War mentality, what's for the American people to dislike?

Or how the same bunch resents food programs that ensure that kids don't have to go miss breakfast. You aren't going to learn very much if your belly is empty. I find it so bizarre that the right has such a deep concern that others might benefit from a government program.   But as someone has already point out on this thread - the conservative mindset is such that they view being poor as somehow a moral failing, and think that those people are avoiding a rightful punishment for their crime of being poor, and well, we just cannot have that.

Later I was able to go to night school and get my high school diploma which eventually allowed me to go to university where I balanced my schedule so I could work full time and attend school full time.

The American Liberty League was created by the richest families in the nation to join with Germany and Italy to establish fascism in all countries.  The League espoused rule by dictator to protect their wealthy interests to the detriment of democracy and Constitutional governing.  After the nation climbed out of the depression and won WWII through the lives of working people, the same cabal worked to install fascism through the Republican party in Congress.  The next major step was the assassinations of both Kennedys and Martin Luther King, Jr. to ensure Nixon's election began the process of dismantling all of the Depression and War era regulations.  The same cabal created the ALEC led by the Koch Family.  The government is now in ineffective gridlock to set the stage for establishing a Dictator.  Study the history.

0,"This is the crux of the argument and I'm glad we're here.  We both want the same thing, we just have the exact opposite strategy.  I believe that people like Tyler and I (and probably you) stand to benefit from development. Because there just is not enough supply right now, and it's fucking everything up.  SF is, to my eye, the example of your approach while Seattle is my approach. In SF, they won't let anybody build anything but they have rent control—all that does now is lock-in the old Boomers, who hate their new market rate neighbors. Seattle built fast and rents there have actually fallen, finally, after that building boom. The upward pressure was relieved.  How will it play out? Well, I might be right and I might be wrong, but I think development will save Portland culture by stemming the insane lack of supply. And for this perspective I get a lot of flak.

The nations of the world, especially the nearly 100 nations with which the Kingdom of Hawai'i has diplomatic treaties, have a political, diplomatic, moral and ethical mandate to demand that the US end its unlawful occupation of Hawai'i.

Where she argues that  """"[t]he Western feminist model of emancipation seem[s] to clash with [the desire of young Muslim women] to stay home and raise a family,"""" she seems to be arguing that this is a reasonable expectation that's interpreted from a cultural perspective. But staying home to raise a family isn't a religious or cultural right. Rather it's an economic choice in this country. Most Canadians would surely agree that a woman has right to make such a choice provided the cost of that choice doesn't rest with taxpayers. Most women and families realize that obtaining and maintaining a North American standard of living and its associated materialistic aspects requires two working spouses unless one has a substantial income. Perhaps women who don't like this should examine their own values and expectations and particularly their own materialism before finding fault with the host culture.

This was where the KKK and some law enforcement officers murdered three people who were registering blacks to vote and buried them in an earthen dam. Bush Senior's campaign did use the Willie Horton ads as anti-black dog-whistles to energize their campaign. But the first Republican to use a """"southern strategy""""  to move Dixiecrats from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party was Richard Nixon in 1968.  That only leads us up to today. Drumpf has refused to reject the support of David Duke, former grand wizard of the KKK. He also has refused to reject the support of American neo-Nazis...in fact, one of his campaign tweets was a retweet of a poster from a neo-Nazi site.

And while Obama was proved wrong, you would have to be completely intellectually dishonest to say that the media has not played very fast and loose with the truth during this last election and since.

Maybe the Son was so far off base with a lack of respect for not just the Wolves but the vehicle that probably wasn't his to start with.

Furthermore, the author hangs the slow recovery on Obama without attribution to the Bush-authored economic meltdown that precluded it or the Republican-congress passive-aggressive foot dragging that exacerbated it.  He believes in alternative solutions to our current problems, I get that, but if he wants to have any credibility, he should at least own where most of those problems originated.

0,"je me souviens: I am not sure what you mean by “the lending money to property owners part.”  ”GO Bonds” are very short-term low-interest bonds. As I understand it, the City of Eugene borrows money in spring, fixes roads in the summer, and pays off the bonds back in the fall when property owners pay annual taxes.  The City of Eugene could avoid borrowing money, but then they would have to wait from November tax receipts until the following summer to do work, when inflation would make the cost of work more expensive.  Again, the street repair program is a well managed, fiscally prudent, community support program. It is a great example of the City of Eugene doing what the community expects.

While at the same time, Trump's top advisor was doing the same thing Kurtz was accusing Clinton's aides of doing. And arguably worse as Bannon was reaching into the Vatican.

Sadly we don't and we have to live with that - at least for now.  I'm afraid I cannot in good conscience vote for an individual that I think would be a very poor President just because the most popular alternative looks even less suitable.  At least, I cannot do so when there are other choices on the ballot that are, in my opinion, better candidates for the Presidency than either of the major party candidates.  I will certainly vote but I will vote (as always) for the candidate that I genuinely believe will do the best job.  I wish everyone else felt able to do the same but I do understand why - given our voting system - some do not.  Yes, the candidate I vote for may lose. Yes, someone I might not like might win. I see that as the price that we all pay as part and parcel of living in a democracy.

From the start Obama surrounded himself with advisers from the Clinton era and Wall Street. He then bailed out the banks at the expense of Main Street and whitewashed the Bush-Cheney war crimes by pretending they never happened. The rest was commentary - earnest rhetoric but no action.

0,"This article did bring out a couple of important points about the complexity of calculating actions. The sequestration concept is one that gets ignored when people look at only a very short term release. To compare the carbon input of lighting or fossil fuel that has been sequestered for millions of years to the short term ups and down that are measured in days to decades of agricultural activities is misleading.  When the long term sequestered products are added to the normal biological actives is where problems come in. The ecological impact is also not accounted for.  The ecological impact of cutting rainforest for grazing is large but the replacement of grazers is small and may be positive in terms of ecology.  Many square miles of monoculture beans or oats is harmful to the environment so grass feed beef is better than feel lot beef but it may also be better for the environment than people consuming beans and oats from massive monoculture.

Putting a loophole, restricting the sale, to the provision of the access just makes even more of a paperwork shuffle further complicating the sale of the property and potentially using the access as a bargaining tool rather than a normal property transaction. Not to mention the act of putting restrIctions on Natives selling their own land that would  smell off sorts. A great example would be a Campbell property having instant, pre-agreed access to the airstrip.

0,"""""Depressed loan activity in the commercial sector reflects widespread lack of confidence that state legislators will be able to reverse an unsustainable pattern of multibillion dollar deficits when they meet next year.""""  That is just not true.  The fact is that when state income falls, the amount of wealth in the state falls.  The only way to avoid this is to use existing savings.  The dividend is not savings (though the fund principle is).  As the budget reserve is used up, wealth in the state will begin to fall in earnest. Taxes (taking money from the public) will not increase statewide income (robbing Peter to pay Paul). The general fall in wealth is aggravated by the loss of high paying oil jobs.  Depressed loan activity is due to the fact that if oil prices stay low, statewide wealth will fall, resulting in an overall contracting economy.  People seem to be coming to grips with the idea that oil prices might stay low for years to come, long outlasting easy to access state savings.

0,"One of the best attributes of Obama in my mind is his resistance to starting more wars - as in Syria.  But he was not strong enough to close down existing pointless wars nor avoid involvement in Libya.  Put Hillary in there and I suspect we would see her proving herself as macho and killing American servicemen and innocent civilians.  At least the Donald has stated he intends to focus more on the home country and let sovereign foreign countries settle their own affairs.  Whether even he could resist the war lobby is debatable, but I think Hillary would be their tool.  She has to prove she is manly after all.  So I agree Obama has some good attributes specifically including some resistance to more war.  If left up to me, we would maintain a strong military, but disengage from any conflict not involving a direct attack on American citizens or land.

Why the big difference, fella?  As for your other allegations...well, you need to sharpen up your reading comprehension, math and analytical skills.  For example, there are more than two political parties; therefore getting rid of one doesn't leave just one party.  Also, getting rid of one party doesn't mean that a new party couldn't arise, or that I'd be against the new party.  See how that works? I even left hints in my post, although that shouldn't be necessary in order to understand my point.  Finally, being educated about what the DOC does and does not do, and having access to information about the DOC doesn't equate to my having a """" prison  background,"""" whatever that means.  I've never been incarcerated or worked for the DOC.  You can't say the same, can you?  Again, classic projection.

The media seemed to assume 100% of its audience was pro Democrat. Anyone who hinted of support for right wing politics was immediately under attack in at times a physically abusive way. As a result most right wing support was in silence - it was safer to lie and say """"I love Hillary"""". No wonder pollsters and the media got it so wrong.  In a democratic society, once you have listened to the answer, you can state your own opinion. But you are only entitled to have one and debate the merits of it, You are not entitled to force your opinions on others. You must be prepared to agree to disagree.

That's coming by way of police culture from the media and the mainland, and that's a larger problem that a black police chief might address.  And he's not the only black guy here targeted by skin color, he's just the one that made the news.  Why the rest of the media isn't all over it is because navigating pulling up the police, court, and medical records to substantiate everything is probably too difficult.  But you'd have to ask them.

0,"Point taken.  You will find private sector pensions are only available to about 50% of the work force compared with 90%+of public sector employees. You will also find public pensions have the huge advantage of being defined benefits instead of defined contributions, are annually adjusted for inflation, and have lower penalty free thresholds so public employees get to retire years earlier.  About 5 years ago, a comparison of 2 middle management couples who put the same personal contribution into their employer administered pension plans found that the public sector couple retired 4 years earlier and wound up with over 200% the total payout of the private sector couple.  This huge imbalance has been narrowed a bit by the Harper government requiring public employees to contribute more to their plans and some other changes but we continue to have a two class society - privileged public sector retirees and private sector retirees (who as net taxpayers foot the hefty public sector bill).

When the ACA passed in 2010, the Obama administration required that plans meet the new standards for small group plans: They had to cover the 10 essential health benefits, for example, and couldn't charge older people monthly insurance premiums that were more than three times higher than those of younger people. The new bill would change all that. It would eliminate most state regulation of association health plans and put oversight in the hands of the federal Department of Labor.  If this passes the Senate, employer sponsored plans are going to resemble what they were trying to do with TrumpDon'tCare.  Keep calling your Senators or you might find yourself kicked to the curb by Republicans like Don Young who voted Aye.

It was contingent on the city and the province putting much bigger shares into the kitty - money the feds knew they didn't have, and couldn't easily raise.  It was political mischief designed to cause the most trouble, not to build transit. . Finally, the reason the Conservatives don't oppose it is because (a) it doesn't improve transit;  (b) it robs more worthwhile projects of funding; (c) it funnels construction money to Conservative supporters; and (d) it functions principally as a subsidy to a failing mall that was built in the wrong place 45 years ago.

Betrayal by community members and relatives, a problem a victim feels does not get resolved, a problem they may not even feel able to discuss - and you have a recipe for suicide as seeming the only way out for abused kids.  There's likely way too much acceptance and tolerance in some native communities of both alcohol abuse and sexual abuse. Why aren't such communities instead declaring cultural war on behaviours so destructive to their own communities? Gov't programs can only go so far without community leaders and members being on board & committed to community healing, and not be in denial.

1,"It is a crime to criticize, doubt, or disagree with Islam in Islamic states.  This is blasphemy and the sentence is death. It is a crime and a sin to leave Islam. A Muslim who rejects Islam is an “apostate” and the punishment for apostasy is death (and eternal damnation in hell thereafter). Under sharia, it is forbidden for anyone to try to convert a Muslim to another religion.  When Islam is doubted or defamed in any way, Muslims should violently defend it.  Muslims consider all non-Muslims and non-Muslim culture useless and see their goal to make the whole world Muslim. Everything before Islam is jahiliyya or ignorance, of no value and should be destroyed.   Under Islam, non-Muslims must pay a large tax. Once Muslims conquer a country and convert the government to Islamic law, non-Muslims have the choice to convert or die. However, Christians, Jews, and some Zoroastrians have the choice between becoming Muslim or becoming a dhimmi.   Read Bat Ye'or's publication Eurabia.

However, I would not fault the Governor for not issuing clemency to felons that committed violent crimes in the past; while I might fault the Governor for issuing clemency to such felons, regardless how much time has past since committing their crime. Felons have the right to review; victims (living or dead) have the right to expect justice. That justice need fit the crime. Murdering or raping someone is a lifetime sentence for the victims. So too should the justice imposed on the felon(s) responsible for such violent actions.

We have given them the knowledge needed to   manufacture and they have given us cheap goods.  Unfortunately, the next step absent domestic need to maintain manufacturing expertise, is the loss of our very ability to produce.  We look to a future where the US lacks the expertise to manufacture and is thus at the mercy of our foreign suppliers.

Political sniping and obstructionism has always levied a heavier price in the end, than compromise and acceptance of status quo. I favor bringing Russia into NATO, quarantining China & N. Korea, and issuing a technical declaration of war, so that if a first-strike seems necessary, the US won't be making a sneak-attack like Japan did. While China has ICBMs, they can't hurt us nearly as much as Russia could. Without Russian support, China would be looking at becoming a nuclear wasteland, while we would have a few cities devastated. As horrendous as that sounds, how often does any of us reflect on how easy it would have been to have put Hitler in check, if we had done it at first blush?

The pricing in these shopping locations is becoming cheaper and allows people to be outdoors. In Canada, the weather plays in favor of enclosed malls.

The taxing entity in this case is subsidizing the specific venture and giving it an advantage by reducing the cost as compared to other venture that do not have the tax break.  Take mining on federal land.  That industry still enjoys a benefit/subsidy granted to them since 1874 whereas when they lease federal land they pay $5/acre where all other industries have to lease land at the going rate.  Obviously the federal government is subsidizing that industry over the others as it pertains to operations on federal land. BTW, because the only federal subsidy that solar receives is the Investment Tax Credit and wind receives the Production Tax Credit, by your definition neither one of them receives any subsidy.

That water vapor holds heat can be demonstrated by the scientific method; that CO2 holds heat can't.  The theory is that more CO2 causes more water vapor, which is where it's contribution to warming comes from.  But that's debatable.  More H20 has feedbacks - clouds and snow - (cont'd)

0,"FACT: Before the ACA, those of us who could afford health insurance were being charged extra for everyone who had no insurance but used emergency rooms.  Hospitals have to make up the gap somehow.  For those with insurance, companies often found loopholes and denied coverage.  ACA may need improvement, but those who get serious illnesses can be sure they will get treatment.  The 'repeal and replace' attempt by the Republicans is not meant to make anything better, it is to help save money for the wealthy, because those poor things are paying too much in taxes.  The GOP won't give up on it unless enough of us protest.  With any of their plans, expect the bad old days when catastrophic illness meant you would go broke, perhaps homeless.  And many died without treatment, because they wanted to keep their homes.  Another question is, if you are now in treatment, will that be taken away?

Washington has survived on a state sales tax for as long as I can remember, ( 70 plus years). It also kept creeping up and never went back down, however, sales tax can be controlled by our individual decisions. If you don't mind paying the sales tax or it just happens to be worth it in order to buy what you want, then it's your decision. Income tax gives you no flexibility of decision. You just pay it whether or not you buy any thing at all.

0,"Father Reese does not know to distinguish a metaphor from reality. What Jesus said about marriage is not a figure or a metapher,  like in the other Jesus word's  he quotes. On marriage and divorce, Jesus alluded to the beginning in response to the jews: """"Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning"""" [...] “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh ? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” The Lord is very clear about marriage and divorce. Marriage is a divine institution that shows in a visible way  how God's love to every soul is: unconditional and for ever. Even if we are unfaithful, He remains faithful. He never """"divorces"""" a soul, even if he or she are unfaithful.

But the article is specifically saying that this is an *alternative* to taking out dividends or salaries now and paying tax on that amount.  There is no good tax reason to take money out of a company now and loan it back in.

In return the SOA will receive royalties of 12.5% for fields on state lands and several points less on federal lands. The price of oil would need to jump into the 70’s before one cent of production tax is generated.  The costs to the state will be incurred when the fields ACTUALLY START PRODUCING now. Oil tax reforms, FINALLY passed by the legislature during one of the SPECIAL SESSIONS this summer, made the change. Once production starts, a producer can deduct the accumulated costs for the project from the gross revenue of their North Slope operations. Their net revenue is then taxed at 35%. So the SOA is reimbursing oil companies 35 cents for every dollar of costs.  And then there are the production tax credits….

This is my opinion only, but I really wonder if men don't see the fact their responses are controlled by opinions of other men.  Women are excessively influenced by those same thoughts and both devise unhealthy solutions to get past that fact.  When I was in grad school back in the day, I did multiple studies on these issues.  In one survey I asked men and women: """"who was the most important person in your life"""". It was a male authority figure in both cases.  Then I asked who was the most detrimental person in your lives and again, both sexes said a male authority figure.  That could be daddy, or grandpa, a boyfriend, teacher, coach, or a boss.  This describes the downside of patriarchy and it hasn't changed in forty some years.  It has to change or we may not have forty more years.

Even so, I do think that the transition to a full public transit will require some adjustment, some small inconveniences like walking a little longer, or sharing your ride with the masses. But, then, a pollution free atmosphere, park-like boulevards, and an increase in general civility is worth it, don't you think? Just an observation, Victoria (BC) has built quite an extensive and enjoyable system of bikeways. The latest addition runs from one of the suburban areas (pace Torontonians, I know, I know) into the city.

City planners need to realize they have to acount for nature much better when they make their concrete jungles and foolishly decide to build on flood plains and waterfronts for aesthetic appeal.  Be more like Edmonton that has devoted pretty much all the North Saskatchewan River valley floodplain to parks and recreation greenspace that will cost insurers and taxpayer's considerably less in the event of a natural flood.  Toronto has foolishly decided to build directly on the waterfront that has shown over time to have cycles of higher water levels and not built proper drainage infrastructure to accomodate the concrete and asphalt when they poured over nature.

It simply allows a few people to win the lottery and have an apartment while making housing even more unaffordable for the rest of the people.  And the program still requires property owners to participate in the program.  There is also the issue of who is pay for the subsidized housing?

Upper middle class professionals are protected by the law; they can, if they need to litigate for compensation for any number of cveryday cases, from personal injuries to malpractice suits; from landlord-tenant disputes to discrimination and human rights violations. The majority of Canadians, contrarily, live at the mercy of the rich and powerful and the professional class, unable to get compensation for personal injuries because they cannot afford a lawyer. And both lawyers and judges are more likely than ever to consider the case of a low income worker not worth the court's time or the law firm's time. There is no justice for the majority of Canadian. No justice = no democracy.

0,"America's Constitution forbids prejudicial treatment based on ethnicity and/or religion. The concept of hate crime stems from an understanding of rights and ethics enshrined in documents like the US Constitution. Banning religious or national groups outright is about as unAmerican as it gets.  The US already employed a thorough screening process to ensure criminals and potential terrorists wouldn't get through. They were overwhelmingly successful measures. There have been no terror attacks perpetrated by immigrants on US soil since 911.  It is a move designed to pander to Trump's bigoted base and, apparently, to you.  Bottom line is, as soon as you label an entire group as banned based only on their religion or country, with no application of any other criteria, you are in the wrong. It is unConstitutional and immoral.  Also, aside from the tens of thousands of innocent people who are at the least inconvenienced, there are tens of thousands who will die trapped  in war zones.

Maybe more free clinics will pop up around the country.  I volunteer at one.  Many of the clients got insurance under Obamacare, but couldn't find a physician to take care of them.  I asked our director if it was some kind of county conspiracy.  She said the docs hate Obamacare because it didn't pay them enough.   I don't know if that was inherent in the policies or the insurers' fault. It took billions of dollars to set-up the infrastructure for Obamacare.  Surely, the stakeholders could figure out how to make this better rather than taking a machete to it and ending up with something worse.

While I disagree with the social conservative wing of the CPC and even some of Scheer's beliefs, I would absolutely support the CPC as an alternative to Trudeau's tax & spend ways.  Economic opportunity and fiscal policy are bigger election issues to me (and no doubt many others) and a minority of further right supporters won't change my vote.  Unless we move to a PR electoral system, it's unlikely that fiscal and social conservatism can be practically decoupled while preserving a contending party under FPTP.

I see this already in Virginia, Florida, CA (Santa Clara, absolutely)and Texas, among others. What we do need, however, are good pastors, leaders,  who look upon a parish as a """"field hospital"""" (drawing on Pope Francis's metaphor) -- an inclusive site of prayer, healing, sacramental ministry, and social justice. In this regard, one wonders if pastors must necessarily be clerics (why not draw from a larger pool of committed lay people?); for while we need more priests, we need QUALIFIED pastors a hundred thousand times more.

0,"Democrats keep insisting there is collusion or some other misdeed committed by Trump's campaign, the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN all try to extend the same narrative. Chuck Todd even interviewed Rob Reiner yesterday ( he mentioned the last time they met was at the Democratic National convention) about his new endeavour with Morgan Freeman with the intent to inform the public about the Russian Investigation.    What they all understand is this investigation could easily and will likely begin to examine the surveillance tactics used by the Democrats and the Deep State against the Trump Campaign. The more of a nothing burger the Russian investigation reveals, the worse the Democratic party looks. After the Democrats actions against Bernie Sander and the Debbie Wassermann Shultz and Donna Brazile sagas, the Democrats can not afford to appear to have used the FBI and NSA against their political rival.

0,"I think the best way to have a discussion when it comes to state or national policy, is to first completely leave emotion out of it.  Big decisions based on or fueled by emotion usually aren't sound and don't consider all that may be effected.  Next, we have to look at the data/numbers/statistics.  As a nation, our human population is in the ball park of 318,000,000.  I don't mean to sound insensitive, but 59 dead and 200 injured by 1 bad apple compared to that total is minuscule (again, leave emotion out of it).  Then we have to look at deaths by mass shootings, deaths by firearms (accidental/murders), and even number of deaths (accidents/murders) by non-firearms.  After all of that, we have to determine whether firearms/non-firearms used in deaths are simply tools or the actual culprit.  In 2015, the average pedestrian deaths in the US was 14.7 each day.  That's almost 15 people dying for walking, each day.  Lastly, if owing a firearm can save at least one life, isn't it worth doing?

In the 60s the Army began to fill that gap with rotary wing platforms using Huey and Cobra gunships. Eventually an airframe was developed for CAS, the A10 Warthog. But the Air Force, in their infinite wisdom, wants to decommission the A10 in favor of their fancy, new strike fighter (more high & fast).

0,"I do not disagree that prisoners should be entitled to expect a reasonable level of health care - perhaps the same level that the average Canadian can expect. However, Sandra Martin fails to mention the extremely poor level of health care that we provide to many of our citizens outside of jails in this country. Possibly she assumes that everybody has an extended health plan or the money and contacts to get decent services for their families. Those who pay (either directly as in BC for public health care, or through various taxes elsewhere in the country) face a shortage of doctors and lengthy waiting lists even for urgent treatments. They pay for their prescriptions and of course dental care is not included. It's a struggle for a lot of honest people and their families. Frankly I have far more sympathy for the working poor and for our disabled citizens and I would prefer that any additional funding goes towards meeting their needs as opposed to those of our prisoners.

0,"Frau Merkel's comments are understandable bluster in an election year, when, like so many politicians, she has to account to an electorate that wants more than it is willing to pay for.  Germany has a good gig going.  Effective control of the Euro has allowed the country to build an export dynamo at the expense of its poorer neighbours, and to hold the deep pocket cards as the inevitable conflicts unfold.  But much of that deep pocket act is a direct result of Germany pulling the short-arm act with respect to military spending commitments for NATO members.  Trump has very reasonably asked NATO members to step up to fair sharing of the costs of maintaining the world's most successful and long lasting military alliance.  Germany is a wealthy country that has not only welched on its commitments, but also leverages the NATO security blanket for its own domestic economic benefit.  When German thinkers accuse America of not being trustworthy, the irony is a bit much.

Its exactly why you can't fly between Honolulu and LA on a plane operated by China Airlines. So maybe you should consider the impact on our aviation industry if we repeal the Jones Act? Why stop there, right? Fire all the Hawaiian Airline employees, go hire foreigners to fly cheap planes inter-island, yes??

The likelihood is that the private operator will use economic resources more efficiently than the municipal government. The transmission grid requires a larger view than either a municipal or provincial government can provide.  Neither provincial nor municipal borders were set out with a view to the optimal size of the electric grid. As for production, we have seen immense grief from poor production choices.

It's just a model not reality as you correctly state.  i do wonder why, back in 1984 when one of his accusers did go to the authorities, that the Portland DA's office explored filing charges but ultimately chose not to,  One could argue that since Mr Murray was a lawyer and public defender in Portland, that perhaps he got a little help. Or of course there just may not have been enough, or any, evidence.. But we wont know as those records are destroyed.  The law didn't allow for these guys to be heard in the criminal courts as the time limits to file had expired. The Mayor often says that he does not have money and that even the house in which he lives does not belong to him.  So I'm not sure money could be what they are after.

In other words, you're not poor if you're paying $10K or more PT. 2) Mortgage deduction < $500k (single), <$1 Million (married).   That's not the price of the house, it's your mortgage. If you have a mortgage higher than the above, then you're not poor. 3) Simplifying the brackets. there's breaks in the middle ranges positive to those folks and smaller changes on the edges. People between $45K & $200K get the biggest benefits. 4) Drop of the AMT. This does benefit the $150K to $1million. Helps those listed. 5) Child tax credit. A joke at $1K upped to another joke of $1600. Hopefully this will be increased. 6) Double deductions - 6K to 12K or married 12K to 24K. Lowers your taxable income.  Higher Income Pays+

1,"First, faux-meats are kind of a misnomer: seitan and soy have been used for centuries as protein options for non meat-eaters in South and East Asia. Tofu is a food in itself. Seitan is a food in itself. They are used in dishes as substitutes for meat alternatives for centuries. There are faux-meat dishes in Asian restaurants that have just as long of a history as the meat-equivalent dishes themselves. To say that seitan has to be 100% like beef is ridiculous.  Second, as many have pointed out, the point of a sloppy or diner food joint catering to vegans is because vegans don't SIMPLY PREFER BROCCOLI - they have cravings for oily, rich, and textured foods other than vegetables the same as meat eaters. The reason they eat non-meat things is for ETHICAL reasons. They refuse to continue to support killing living and pain-feeling beings for the sake of TASTE.

Quite a few people here are reminiscing about the wonderful old days of air travel but seem to be ignoring a significant fact: in real terms, ticket prices now are half what they were in the past. Of course, if you are one of those people wealthy enough to fly frequently 30 or 40 years ago, it doesn't matter that air travel is now more accessible than ever before. But tighter seating and fewer frills have made air travel accessible to the average person on the street. The problem is that the people who lament the loss of their ample leg room, the haute cusine and the Royal Doulton china haven't noticed that ticket prices have become more affordable than ever before. That said, a recent EVA Air flight to Bangkok offered decent leg room and wide enough seats. Some airlines still have it.

0,"The editorial makes some valid points.   A more sensitive and practical decentralized federation might be doable.  However, there are several fundamental differences between Canada-Quebec and Spain-Catalonia: - Catalonia is a net contributor to the Spanish treasury, whereas Quebec is the beneficiary of several Billion dollars per annum of equalization payments from our Federal government. - Quebec has its own legal (civil) system;   Quebec has specific guarantees on representation in the House of Commons, Senate and Federal Supreme court.  Catalonia does not. - Federally both English and French are official languages in Canada, whereas I don't think the Catalonians have language guarantees. - The Spanish government just sent in the National guard to prohibit the Catalonians from attempting to exercise their franchise.  Whether it is too late remains to be seen, but the Spanish government certainly hasn't helped its case.

If you can't refute that consensus, then you can't escape the fact that (a) economic planning can no longer legitimately treat the environment as a 'free good' to be exploited at will with no concern about consequences in the quest for optimum economic benefits, (b) thus a realistic way must be found to factor in greenhouse gas as a cost of production, (c) it is economically as well as environmentally irresponsible to continue to ignore the need to factor in this cost at a fair and reasonable level, and (d) in short, the global economics needs to devise a valid, practical and balanced measure of greenhouse gas emission cost and Canada can play a vital role to that end.

It would be well worth your while to read again the Gospel encounters and reactions related of Jesus and the proper use of power. His model is a servant/ master. Both women and men in positions of authority get to use power. One does so in the world of business, the military and even as a parent. When used properly humans move forward, grow and progress under the care of the one in charge. Power can accomplish good when used with respect, never lording it over the person being directed. Using Jesus' concept of power engenders in the one being lead, loyalty, respect and appreciation for the good direction given. Both women and men can follow this model and achieve good results. It worked for me over four decades as a teacher.

The manager, in this case a Minister of the Crown, needs to clearly communicate the rules and standards of behaviour, and then see to it that they are followed. Otherwise that manager or Minister will quickly become a micro-manager, likely accomplishing little and eroding their staff confidence by displaying an obvious lack of trust. Reward and sanction as the situation dictates and then move on. The tax document in question was far from becoming enforceable. Do I think it would have been poor policy? Yes. Do I think that it should have been “floated”in the public realm? Yes. When we make thoughts and proposals toxic to a Minister we, as citizens, encourage an environment of opacity or secrecy and often complain long and loud about it later. In this case the Minister acted properly and the process worked. What is the real problem with that?

With social changes and technological changes, health care problems and advances are moving faster that ever.  This concerns me too.  When a pragmatic decision to stay afloat financially has to be made, I have little confidence that a political solution will happen in a timely matter.   Politicians are not health experts,   Health experts tend not to be accountants.   Politicians do what gets them elected, not always the best thing for the nation.  For your link, I think the lesson might be that it's very hard to compare US spending on health care with a more socialized system. if  Either system is not financially balanced.  I don't think we have any choice but to provide health care as a right, but we'll have to have multiple layers of care.

0,"It is not about individual police officers who I suspect almost universally intend to do a good job.  It is about policies and tactics ordained and determined by the top brass, civilian politicians, and ultimately us since we are the ultimate bosses of the police.  It is essential to move beyond the focus on individual police officers.  When discussing our many wars, we do not blame individual soldiers for what they do unless their acts contradict orders.  In relation to wars, we more realistically ascribe responsibility to the politicians who gave the orders.  When we discuss police actions, we get focused on the individual officers and not the policies that guide them.  Those with involvement with the public safety/criminal justice system tend to get defensive and lose sight of the need to examine policy and tactics themselves independent of those who carry them out.   Whether to conduct high speed chases, especially in a city, is an important question.  Policy may save or cost lives

The $10.5M payment to Kadr was a major miscalculation.  The porous border control is a fiasco.  Speaking of fiasco, the MMIW Inquiry was a spectacularly bad strategy executed even worse.

Again, it would help if you read the report of the Inquiry Committee.  I agree with Cossman that they were fair.  They certainly did not conclude Camp was an incorrigible misogynist.  They also didn't address Camp's error in law -- the Appeals court ruled on that.  In fact, the tribunal endorsed that judges can't possibly know everything about the law and that mistakes in law are what appeals are for.  And they did not rule that Camp's lack of knowledge was itself misconduct.  It was his persistent and pervasive failure to be impartial and fair that resulted in the ruling of misconduct.

However, the international community and many at the State & Local Government & community level in the US are redoubling their commitment & efforts to address both climate change specifically and, more generally, the retreat of the US from the international community.  In a perverse way, the Trump announcement is positive in that it makes isolates support for his policy & presses the broader domestic & international communities to take constructive action.  Canada needs so be in the forefront in action of this effort but hectoring by us at this time will serve no useful purpose.

It was just paperwork shuffle; I didn't get to provide opinion unless derogatory or unverifiable info was discovered.  Usually, when an applicant was asked to provide further data, and/or to explain discrepancies, that was left to other background investigators.  To ensure fresh eyes on any particular applicant.  If it got to that point, however, due to the added depth of checks, more scrutiny was given to any one applicant and the vetting data they provided.  The last step would be for DOJ rep to make the final call.  This process has basically not changed over the last 20 yrs or so.  Part of the EO is to vet the system and if found to be under the thresholds' increased scrutiny processing, then recommendations would definitely be made to enhance the vetting process than what is already being done.

What artifact of the resurrection events was profound enough to ignite this faith in a 'Risen Christ' in the faithless Saul of Tarsus? What really happened on the road to Damascus?

North of your house and adjacent to your yard is an empty lot.  North of that empty lot is your neighbor's house/yard.  The City plans to build a sewer line just north of your neighbor's property and in its report, determines that the line will pose certain risks: constant sewage smell and possible leeching into the neighbor's yard.  Your neighbor, a City official, uses his leverage to have the sewer line moved down-wind from his property, which now cuts across the empty lot.  The potential risks have been alleviated from your neighbor and are now placed on you.  Sure, the City has sewer lines everywhere, but this one has likelihood of affecting you.  Would you accept that without protest?  With DAPL, the Sioux have decided to protest.  It's more about protesting a risk than it is protesting the existence of oil pipelines.

AVTEC has long waiting period for many of its programs; some students wait a year before beginning their studies.  We are in the transition from older more traditional occupations to a number of programs that need upgrading due to technology.  A major emphasis in vocational programs is suppose to be teaching new skills to employees whose job skill are no longer needed.  As a campus this location already has a great amount of infrastructure. Dorms, dinning halls, indoor and out door recreational programs. I would suspect there are other facilities on site that could be easily modified to provide adequate class room and hands on activity areas.  This facility could could place job skill training as a priority for Alaskans.

Regarding: theologians acting like school boys - Yes, the theologians, usually not bishops, do there job examining what bishops say and do and advising them when they either err, or are have not been successful in what they hope to have done. So, then, they are not schoolboys/girls. - The cardinals as bishops are measured by a different standard.  The Archbishop of Rome has been clear about the level of discussion that needs to be happening in all of the local churches. While these cardinals and their hidden ones are sincere in their dilemma they in effect  asked answers. That is they were asking Archbishop Francis trip himself so that they could pounce as boys would.

Couldn't your logic, which equates the two, be used against you? I.e., how do you know the fetus wants to live? How dare you try and infringe upon the rights of the fetus to die?

The executive order he recently issued is essentially the field goal after three failed attempts at a touchdown with the ball the goal line.  Field goals don’t help when you’re way behind.  He also promised to lower the federal budget deficit.  So far, that’s an outright failure too.  Debt has increased under Trump. And then the border wall.  Almost a year into his administration Mr. Trump has not acquired a single piece of land and has not laid one single brick.  Because you can’t go in to the election year with a huge, problematic, unfinished project (which was Mr. Trumps single biggest promise on the campaign) the wall needs to be complete before the election.  Which leaves even less time to accomplish the feat.  Oh yeah, and the Mexicans have not gotten out their checkbooks either too.

My point is that the tendency of those with socialist sympathies to """"over-attribute"""" the liabilitiy for the unspeakable cruelty of soviet communism (Holodomor, Kulaks etc) to Stalin's personal callousness or desire for power, is wrong. The argument is something like """"if only Trotsky had won the succession race, then Marxism could have been properly implemented"""" (or less bluntly stated forms thereof).  I say that that this view is incorrect - soviet communist policies would always have resulted in misery and death on a large scale. Yes maybe Stalin pushed it further than others would have - but the fundamental flaw remains.  Anyway, thanks for drawing attention to the horrors of soviet communism on the eve of the centenary.

And while I believe Gary Allen's career record of 3,451 yards will never be broken, Sainte Juste is on pace to break even this record if he can manage to rush for 765 yards over the last five games of the regular season.

0,"EN, Your analysis of why the Electoral College was created is flawed.  The true threat to the various """"small"""" states was large population centers (northern cities) dominating the new Federal Government.  Exactly what we would face today if the President was elected by the popular vote.   The """"3/5"""" compromise came about to ensure the small and mostly slave holding states had a large enough population to counter that simple mathematical domination.  If this compromise hadn't occurred, there would be no Constitution and no Union.  The Constitutional debates began in 1787.  Slavery was still legal in some northern states when the debates began and those that had abolished slavery, had only recently done so.  So one has to ask themselves, what would have happened between now and then if the """"3/5"""" compromise hadn't occurred?

There will be more traffic when rail finally takes on passengers compared to traffic before rail construction started.

Some who will live there will take the rail, but many who will commute into town will take their cars.  Koa Ridge means that 3,500 homes will be built in Central Oahu, and the same commute pattern holds for those future residents.  Rail will take so few people off the roads that it can't even accommodate the increase in traffic during its construction period.  And now we find out that it may cost twice as much to finish it.

But again it depends on the level of investment and the costs so all modeling is only roughly true.  It is also worth noting that both laws are designed to incentivize investment - the more you spend in AK, the less you pay in taxes.

Authors Foster and Kimport highlight the characteristics of women seeking abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation.  The authors acknowledge that, in fact, wider “data suggests that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.”[11] The study explores reasons for delay in seeking abortion services, comparing first-trimester and late-term abortion groups.  While there are numerous limitations to the study, the authors suggest that the characteristics of women who seek both first-trimester and late-term abortions are substantially similar.""""

We're in Metro but not actual Vancouver.  Bought long enough ago we don't hold a massive mortgage, so it isn't comparable to buying now, but I think past advice to stay out of the market was wrong- we pay less in mortgage than renters pay/ month and spouse does all renovations including new roof, so it isn't a big cost.  Taxes suck, but once older kids move out we'll rent the suite or older kid can pay rent, but friends who didn't buy have only been justified in the past few years- before then it was more economical to buy as rents went up but house prices never shrunk.  Anyone who bought before 2014 is far better off than a lower mainland renter.  Even a price crash of 50% won't hurt most owners as the appreciation has caused homes to double in just 4 years, but the vast majority of homeowners bought before the doubling.

The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held Canada to its higher true and peaceful destiny with Indigenous Nations rather than siding with aggressive sitting governments bent on assimilation and termination policies.  Even today this Trudeau government seeks to avoid accountability to these higher laws and basic Canadian ideals in his petition to Quash the findings and instructions of the Canadian Human Right Tribunal. His government acts with belligerence while it is the children of Indigenous Nations that continue to do the dying.

Jesus’ statement that he came to ‘fulfill the [Mosaic] Law, not abolish it' is often used by people to try to justify support for very conservative theological positions, including discrimination against women, divorced and remarried couples non-heterosexuals, and so on.  What people who try to attach such beliefs to Jesus neglect or forget to mention is that when Jesus spoke on how ‘the Law’ was to be interpreted or read (the famous ‘you have heard it said … but I say to you’ sayings in Matthew), our Lord turned much of the Mosaic Law on its head with commands to love our enemies, , return good for evil, etc.  Thus, there is no good basis for assuming the traditional interpretations of the Law offered by the Scribes and Pharisees (including discrimination against the ‘impure’) are in any way endorsed by Jesus (and his treatment of the woman caught in adultery shows that).   Better to assume Jesus would take a loving and forgiving approach, as he always does in the Gospels.

0,"""""“Our No. 1 priority is public safety,” Hickenlooper said in a statement.""""  Caring about Safety AFTER folks have died, shows a real lack of care about Safety to begin with!!  While Hick may be a Dem in name, he really allowed Big Oil to call the shots and now people are DEAD and injured.  Unacceptable!!  Safety should ALWAYS guide Quality, and take priority over Delivery Time and Cost.  Hick allowed Cost and Delivery Time to trump Safety!!  2500 foot setbacks should be the norm ... enuf said.  Proof is in this pudding.

1,"This article by this vapid """"journalist """" is a breathtaking example of how low this paper has gone to publish such utterly biased trash!

0,"Communicating the state of the water's safety in De Beque? Why would I do that? Isn't that the CDPHE's duty, generally? Say, Purple Pete, are you perhaps employed by or invested in the petrochemical sector in some way that you have such great zeal to publicly spin on behalf of their collective environmental sociopathy, or would you care to clarify any misconception that may be held over here?

0,"Dear Ms Fonda  Here are my scientific solutions to deal with climate change:-  1. End coal mining in West Virginia and the rest of the USA. 2. Increase nuclear power, which has the lowest carbon footprint 3. Stop hydroppower dams, which destroy trees and increase CO2 production 4. Build more oil ipelines, and reduce oil transport by rail. Railcars increases CO2 emissions compared to    pipelines. 5. Travel with a sail powered boat to Canada. Better still, use oars 6. Stop using air conditioning or heating in our home. Or lights. They all increase CO2 production. 7. Travel only by foot to meet your friends or to go to your yoga class. 8. Do not use plastics, paints, synthetic rubber or any other carbon derived product. 9. No computers or internet or cell phones. Again, they increase CO2 emissions. 10. No medicines either. Same effect as point number 9. 11. Food should be grown only with bulls and ploughs. No fertilizer either. This will ensure the world starves before climate change!
