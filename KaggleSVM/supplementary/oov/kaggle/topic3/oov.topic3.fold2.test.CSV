0,"This finally hit me the other day: Donald Trump has his nose bent out of joint where the NFL is concerned because team owners wouldn't let him join the club.  First, he tried to get his U.S. Football League team, the New Jersey Generals, to either join the NFL outright or through a merger of the two leagues. Then his attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills was rebuffed.  You don't think Donald Trump would carry a grudge ... do you?
"
0,"Delusional.  At a bare minimum, Trump is gonna have to show even handedness. NAFTA is as good as ancient history. If Mexico gets hit with tariffs, so will Canada.  If we were competitive to begin with, especially on manufacturing, we'd still have to worry, but gravity would be on our side. Same thing goes for oil & gas. I shudder to think what's gonna happen now out West with the luddites running the show in Alberta while Trump promises to boost domestic oil production and make the US an even more dominant number 1 producer.  The MSM doesn't get it and prefers to write these light weight stories about 'charm offensives' and bringing out the heavy pop guns from 30 years ago when free trade was next big thing. Canada has structurally priced itself out of the big leagues with irresponsible governments.  Simple enough?

0,"Drat, if we have to put up with Donald Trump bumbling into nuclear war and destruction of the climate that has supported the rise of homo sapiens on planet Earth, can't we at least laugh at The Mooch along the way?

0,"Too bad Trump's dodging responsibility for bring CIC wasn't included in the story.  He is running from the botched Yeman raid. / """"This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something they wanted to do. They came to see me, they told me what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected — my generals are most respected we've had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan."""" / Guess for Tump the only buck that stops here is the money he gets from renting space in his buildings to the US government to protect him and his family.

0,"When Trumplethinskin was hosting celebrity apprentice did that mean he was or was not in the entertainment business ? Was he a celebrity himself? Of course he was! The comments in this blog suggest that the Trumplethinskin is above the celebrity label. He is the epitome of celebrity! incredibly, his disciples just continue to drink his brand of kool-aid.

0,"What experience in NAFTA negotiation does Steve have?  Oh yes, the great settlement of the lumber tariff spat.  That 'tete a tete' with Bushco 2  first, saved Boeing,, second saved the USA $4 billion dollars they weren't going to pay anyway, and third gave Canada 'world wide airlift capability' to get refugees 'home' from anywhere - we still rent Ukrainian 'Ruslans' for anything important. Oh and it cemented the bond that Don Trump seems to want to remove to-day.  And let's not forget the 5 magic beans.  It would have been interesting to have Steve negotiating this round for us. He's been told, 'No!' before.

0,"Gotta love Andy Borowitz.  AMES, IOWA (The Borowitz Report)—Presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed a little-known episode of personal heroism from his youth on Saturday, telling an Iowa audience that he narrowly avoided capture in Vietnam by remaining in the United States for the duration of the war.  “The Cong were after me,” Trump said, visibly stirred by the memory. “And then, just in the nick of time, I got my deferment.”  The former reality-show star said he had never shared his record as a war hero before because “I don’t like to boast.”  “Those brave Americans who, like me, avoided being captured by not serving at all—we are the true heroes,” he said.  http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/trump-says-he-heroically-avoided-capture-in-vietnam-by-staying-in-u-s

1,"I don't think Trump is even smart enough to realize the damage exploding nuclear bombs would do to the entire planet! He probably thinks the destruction would be limited to North Korea and everyone would be worshiping at the feet of T rump. If that was the case, and we were willing to murder millions of innocent North Koreans, the bombs would have been dropped long ago.

1,"Political correct bigots are not only teaching our children bald face pathological lies, but they are now indoctrinating our children with racist stereotyping of us Native Americans. Not one white mascot was banned. In singling out Native Americans PC liberals shamelessly lie and claim there are no other mascots of race. Reference the David Douglas Scots,  white guy in a kilt holding bagpipes, and these pathological liars claim this is culture not race. The political correct pathological liar then claims, in staggering hypocrisy, that the tomahawk is not culture, it's """"racist."""" When it comes to electing a President political correct bigots want to kill the electoral college, claiming Hillary gained 3 million more votes than Trump, and should have won. 90% of us Native Americans overwhelmingly support our mascots, and yet PC liberals think 5% should win. They are shameless staggering hypocrites. They are shameless pathological liars promoting racist bigotry.

0,"I am waiting for Harper to be reinvented a some sort of revered Elder Statesman.  Lyin Brian Mulroney, who reduced his party to just 2 MPs ( Charest later quit to become Liberal Premier of Québec -) was being whitewashed by Harper as some sort of Political Éminence grise, until the Oliphant Inquiry reminded us of how Lyin Brian earned his name.  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/the-oliphant-inquiry-was-an-almost-perfect-ottawa-case-study/article1344409/  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/oliphant-applied-the-smell-test---and-mulroney-failed/article4321301/  https://www.google.ca/#q=mulrony+oliphant+inquiry+globe+and+mail  http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jean-j-charest/  """"While in New Zealand for the Commonwealth Games in January 1990, Charest resigned from Cabinet for having improperly spoken to a judge in a case regarding the Canadian Track and Field Association.""""

"
0,"Unsurprisingly, the people who don't like the results of the poll claim it was rigged. But its findings are not substantially different from those of similar polls taken by other polling agencies over the years. And they make sense. Most Canadians, at least the educated ones, understand that new taxpayers are needed to fund the pensions of the growing population of seniors, and pay for extra health care,  etc. As seniors retire, they not only need to be replaced in the workforce, but they place a higher demand on these resources. It's not rocket science. As for the second part about souring on the United States, I see no disagreement. I understand that many people worldwide have decided to avoid traveling to the States. It's the Trump effect.
"
0,"Well, president Trump was elected.  Where a pink hat, say """"go ducks"""", and complain about all the red state voters who aren't smart enough to be voting anyway.  He's a Birkenstock-in.
"
0,"Exactly. Trump exhibits most of the traits of fascism: He asserts that the Fatherland has lost its former glory and is under attack from within and from without. He scapegoats racial, ethnic and religious minorities. He proposes to keep people out and throw people out based on ethnic and religious considerations. He taps into fear and stokes hate. He mocks the disabled, attacks minorities and ridicules women. He offers not so much a program or a policy, but simply himself, the Great White Savior. He shows little understanding of how democratic institutions work and he demonstrates no inclination to work within them. But the United States in 2016 is not Germany in the 1930s.  Our institutions are stronger, our democracy more secure. We will survive the Trump presidency, but given his contempt for our system and institutions of government, and his corruption, incompetence and instability, the Trump presidency will be the most serious test of constitutional government since the Civil War.

"
0,"“Ms. Huffington says she does not feel that covering his campaign as entertainment was a mistake.” ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Let’s face it, Trump’s campaign coverage by all news media was over-blown. Trump’s every move, every tweet, every dishonest statement was given the ‘front page’ treatment, with no fact checking or rebuttal. The MSM were (and still are) more interested in ratings and page clicks than honest, investigative reporting and the truth. Trump didn’t need to spend $-millions on campaign advertising...... the media gave him a free ride.
"
0,"As much as some people seem to hate the UN, its very existence was made necessary by the very same tone of militant nationalism that Trump now preaches, and which led to two world wars in the first half of the 20th Century.  If Trump moves on North Korea, inevitably they would try to take as many South Koreans and Japanese with them as possible.  If Trump moves on Iran, the mess that is the Middle East will only get worse, pretty much begging for another round of ISIS-type radicals and another mass migration of penniless refugees.  It's all well and good to sneer at diplomacy and negotiation when you don't get everything you want, but diplomacy and negotiation aren't about getting everything you want.  It's about compromise, saving lives and preserving peace.... but Trump's not interested in peace... because you can't """"win"""" peace.
"
0,"I think you are reading too much into her statement, """"she looked forward to rejecting Trump’s “very hurtful” portrayal of immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.""""  You are complaining that Trump never said ALL Mexicans. I don't read her statement as so absolute either.  Trump used the same imprecise language, """"They're rapists"""" is what he said.

0,"The last blowhard Con that went """"man to man"""" with Trudeau wound up losing the boxing match.  Trump will have his Daddy find a doctor to excuse him from fighting, again.
"
0,"The Toddler President, setting policy by childish riposte to every poke and jab he imagines.  The price for a new Air Force One is too high, the F-35 is too expensive, but dumping trillions on a new arms race in response to a taunt from the Russian President is okay.  Its going to be interesting watching the year unfold as Republicans try to be seen as responsible both fiscally and socially as the Trump Presidency lurches from one inane position to the next.
"
0,"Among the traits of Trump voters is their habit of voting against their self interest. They don't seem to be able to follow the money. As they say, elections have consequences. They elected a con man that has no history of caring about them.
"
0,"Who knows Richard.  Trump might open diplomatic relationships with N. Korea just to send you there.  You'd be up against Dennis Rodman for the job, though.  He was on The Apprentice I hear, so I'm afraid he's got an inside track.
"
0,"It would be """"funny"""" if it were not perfidious how some supporter-apologists for Pres. Trump will use the """"throw the first stone"""" defense for the serial liar. One of the """"usuals"""" below asks in pseudo righteousness: """"Can you name a politician who doesn't """"gild the lily"""" as we say?"""". Whaaa?! That is not what Jesus meant; this is not only illogical but itself an abuse of truth and of the civility that makes community let alone civilization work. I am actually beginning to understand that much of the Trump support comes from people who simply want to justify their own perfidy.

1,"Tillerson and the Trump are having their first face-to-face meeting today since Tillerson called the Trump a """"f**** moron.""""  This should be MOST interesting!  In the meantime, the Trump has tweeted that he would win a war of words with Tillerson.  Isn't all this childishness amusing, which is its intent?  Too bad we lacked this amusement during the previous administration.  We're finding out what we missed!  Keep in mind this is the highest level of government in the United States.  Oh, lord, help us!

1,"The only thing wrong with your projection Icon666 is that so far ...: 1) The party misdeeds have all been committed by the DNC not the GOP ...don't forget that it was the democrats who sat on their hands, covered their mouth and eyes and put their fingers in their ears like 3 stupid chimps sitting on a wall while Hillary Clinton defrauded and disenfranchised every single democrat of their vote in the primary by kinking those primaries to deny the democrats of a legitimate nominee. Nothing goes to the heart of our system of government than this fraud you all sat around and pretended wasn't happening ...Pathetic! 2) No racist events have been tied to either Trump or the GOP ...and as a matter of fact it's the democrats who have the long and storied history of racism ..not the GOP. Filibustered any civil rights acts lately? 3) Social idiocy you mean like bowing to Saudi Kings? like burning over 9000 gallons of jet fuel on earth day?  CONT'D
"
0,"Obviously he has nothing to hide. Its the Dems who are getting worried. The last recount boosted Trumps tally and cost Hillary several thousand of her votes..  Lets see where the chips fall since it was the Dems who were  all upset about Trump. Maybe Hillary has a chance to over turn the  election after all.
"
0,"Don't you mean Third Lady?  Trump dumped his first two wives.  An example of Trump 'family values'.
"
0,"I wish to retract the comment wherein I praised this person for his spiritual wisdom when writing about polarization in the church. This is dumb, brainwashed hype. The NCR has """"deplorables"""" on it staff, and religious are included-Fr. Reese. It is a blessing in disguise that Trump got elected-first, because it allows one to see what the so-called """"common man"""" is like, and also because it gives the dross a chance to surface in the Church, to the end that one is no longer deceived by the illusion of religiosity projected by some. It is a time of sifting. If we learn the lesson from having elected him, it will be for the best. As it is, to find the illusions stripped from the self-righteous Christians that rule in the Church and in the world is wisdom worth many times its proverbial weight in gold. Books are being written today about the decay and collapse of organised religion, particularly Christianity and how this too, is a blessing in disguise.

"
0,"Trump is disentegrating the Republican party.  They have been a divisive bunch since Reagan finished his eight years; if I subscribed to conspiracy theories, I would suspect that the Tea Partiers had received whitewashed funding from the Dems.  He likes to think of himself as a dealmaker, but the tactics he used to build up his real estate empire don't work in public life.  You can't squeeze out political opponents in the same way you squeeze out rent controlled tenants.  I think we are looking at 45 months of bickering and non-achievement followed by a Democratic win.  Unless, of course, Bannon gets his birthday wish and gets Donald to nuke the bejesus out of North Korea.   That would be a whole new ball game, and while the former will be no picnic it beats all hell out of the latter.
"
0,"Israel is a brutal racist regime bent on pursuing its goals without any regard for moral principles or international law.  They get away with it because AIPAC and other pro-Israeli lobbies effectively control  the foreign policy of the most powerful nation on Earth. And while Israel keeps taking American taxpayers’ money to the tune of 3 billion dollars a year, they will not listen to any advice from the White House.  Why should they? Through AIPAC they own Congress and next year looks like they got their claws right into the White House. Just ask Sheldon Adelson who opened up his petty cash box and doled out $25 million to help Trump get elected. And now Donald dutifully decrees that U.S. will move its embassy to the “eternal capital of the Jewish people” Jerusalem, which would certainly be the coup de grace to the two state solution. There is a reason why virtually all  UN members including UK+France have over the years consistently voted against settlements. Its NOT anti-semitism.
"
0,"Any decisions that Trump makes are made with Trump's best interests in mind.  Not the US's.
"
0,"Actually, it was BO with the BS about him lowering the tides and global temperatures while addressing his delirious Chicago supporters in 2008 flanked by fake Greek columns and puffs of fake smoke and other fake theatrics.  And Trump is not wrong about the need to restore the rule of law and respect for those enforcing the rule of law nor is he wrong about The Affordable Health Care Act becoming increasingly unaffordable to most Americans and imploding as most insurers are dropping out of the plan.  But don't let the facts or the law or common sense stop you and your cohorts  from your quest to throw the government and the country into chaos and anarchy because it was """"Hillary's Turn"""" and she lost.
"
0,"The debate showed the strong difference between each candidate.  To be as blunt as Mr. Trump likes to be, he made a complete fool of himself.  By the end of the debate he was ranting about Rosie O'Donnell and how she attacked him and no one liked her.  He's stuck in his reality TV world.  There's nothing passionate about his speeches....passion is often a beautiful thing....he's simply angry and full of bluster.  In contrast, Hillary Clinton is a dignified person.  I've followed her career for some time--I admire her dedication to health care, families, young people and those who face challenges.  It's been said many times that she doesn't quit and I think there are many women like her.  They put one foot in front of the other for the sake of their families and others.   The difference is that Hillary Clinton has been in power and on the public stage.  Her mistakes are few considering how under the microscope of public opinion she's been her entire adult life.
"
0,"A USA single payer plan will be more like Obamacare and the Republican plan. Or plans from countries that are a combination of private insurance and government subsidies. Plus cost control-- preferably by competition and not forced regulation-- in particularly drug costs that can be $50,000-$100,000 a year for drugs-- like Trump's idea of an arrangement or """"deal"""" for drug costs between drug companies and the Federal government. People coming from overseas for medical care is not huge and are in most cases wealthy people. They come to the USA to get the American best in world practices in areas like heart and organ transplants. Same happens when people who can afford it go to top facilities for brain tumors in Houston, or to top plastic surgeons in Los Angeles and pay in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"
0,"Excellent news. I wish him well of course, and I thank Trump if he actually had any role at all in this.
"
0,"I think a more important factor is the feedback effect of polls, which professional pollsters (presumably) discount, but which engineers fully understand.  Trump was given no chance at all of winning by pollsters and the media.  This belief was fed back to the voting populace. Even as late as September (if I remember correctly), Democrats were being urged to vote for Clinton not in order to ensure a win, but to give Clinton a resounding victory; to show the whole world that America overwhelmingly rejects Trump's philosophy (if one can call it that). This was a huge mistake given the luke-warm attitude of most toward Clinton. Many assumed that Clinton was a shoo-in and simply stayed home or did not vote.  Had Democrats really believed Trump had a snowball's chance, the outcome of this election probably would have been different.
"
0,"Meanwhile, he's asking for $999 mil to start his wall. Heo no! He said Mexico is going to pay for it so he got to go get it from Mexico. I ain't gonna pay for a Trump Wall so he can use it for his ego! If this request goes through, we'll really need to get all those who vote to pass this item in the budget out of office. This is what we get after Trumpcare? I haven't seem his budget proposal but it would be quite interesting. I want to see how he's going to increase military spending, build his wall ($999 mil for 64 miles only), get Trumpcare in place, cut corporate taxes, cut income taxes. No money coming in but huge increase in spending doesn't work for my budget. I'm thinking he'll borrow from the Russian banks. They have a lot of cash. His guy used to run the Bank of Cyprus that is used by Russians to launder money. Son in law has the ins with the VEB Bank chairman. The reason why he has so many Russian connections if becoming clear. He borrow from them.

0,"In Alaska?  Trump carried the state by 14.7% of the vote.  If every Libertarian, Green, etc. third party voter had somehow found Hillary Clinton an appealing rallying point for their vote . . . Trump would have won Alaska by five or six percent instead of 14.7.  The people who put Trump in power were the corrupt Democrats who conspired to rig the game to ensure their incredibly unpopular choice for the nomination got their party's nomination and then relied on their hurbis and dumbness to botch the general election .  To paraphrase Irish sentiments about the cause of the Potato Famine, """"God put Trump on this earth, Hillary Clinton put him in the White House.""""
"
0,"'Violence, vandalism and destruction of property'.  Do you mean the 'security barrier' that was run over? That's like protestors pushing over a fence, gate or barrier. The remainder of the incidences he mentions are trespass. You're not seriously equating that with 'violence', are you? Is that the best you and he can come up with? Greenpeace is a non-violent organisation - violence, as you describe, is against the environmental ethos, and companies and their agents in governments don't hesitate to use it. What's your position on the bombing of Rainbow Warrior? Yes, a lot of money is lost when operations are halted and trespass is a 'criminal' (misdemeanor) esp when property is damaged (comparing a homeless person on one's property is trite). But often that's all activists have at their disposal. You like comparisons: I guess, then, you've sympathy for Trump's view 'both sides' were to blame for Charlottesville - both sides took to the streets. But what justifies the right's attack.
"
1,"The Clinton Foundation employs people, has financed access to clean water for thousands of people, hasn't been flagged for audit by the IRS and has received the highest ratings by independent charity examining organizations.  Trump used his foundation as a pass through and hasn't put in his own money since 2008 or so.  Comparing foundations side by side with the same criteria, it is clear that you are either blind or willfully ignorant.

0,"cont.  crumbling infrastructure; lack of sensible/workable immigration policies/practices; outsourcing of family wage jobs; a huge balance of trade deficit; a nation operating on deficit spending; a population operating on deficit spending (without credit purchasing our economy would collapse in a month), and, on the foreign stage...... a hopelessly confused policy of engagement/disengagement in the Middle East.  I'm guessing each poster on this site could add many more.  We've got plenty to think about and work on.  Perhaps it's time to quit gloating about the election and start to see if we can find some solutions.

0,"Trump will destroy World Trade Organization. China’s export to US is less than 4 % of its GDP.The US export to China has been growing 468 percent over the last decade. China already is the world’s largest auto market and largest market. American big three autos sell more cars in mainland China than in the US. Apple, Boeing, agricultural producers and many many others, their largest market is not in the US but in China. The US exports more than 160 billion dollars of goods to China each year. In addition, the US profits 150 billion dollars annually from Chinese service sector( not take into account in trade figures). The trade war can contribute 10 million job losses in the US. The factories, department stores and other sectors will also have to shut down or mass layoff due to a lack of parts and components cross the country. China will dump the US bonds in the open international market. The US will slip into recession for decades to come.

0,"Trump is the embodiment of two things. .  1. If the next President only appoints one of his relatives to a high position, it will look like an improvement (the Kennedy brothers were an example of what the US government should NOT do) of what has come immediately before, instead of a reversion to the standards that existed before hand. This also includes tax return releases, etc. .  2. What may come of this (potentially) is a strengthening of laws/rules, etc., that have been there all along, yet no one has truly tested them. Trump truly could shoot someone, and only the Congress could move against him. The presidency is an elected Emperor. . . As for parliamentary democracies, since the PM always comes from the majority party, they too are an elected Emperor. . Every PM since WWII has increased the centralization of the operation of the government. It has started to become especially noticeable since Mulroney. The person may change in the job, the machinery remains. . Democracy is thin.

0,"Given the recent revelations regarding the far more extensive collusion of the IC and specifically Mueller and Rosenstein in the Uranium One pre-transfer extortion and bribery  (and their refusal to effectively prosecute criminal activity) one wonders why the bogus political theater of investigating the Trump team has not been disbanded entirely.  Mueller and Rosenstein have absolutely no credibility investigating anyone, let alone the President of the US that they politically oppose.

1,"The EPA's Energy Star program has been, for consumers, a raging success. A label, right there on each of the displayed home appliances in a store, tells you flat-out how much electricity your latest purchase is going to use and what it's going to cost you; if you want a version that costs less, you can easily find a brand that's more energy-efficient and go from there. If the program didn't exist, such comparisons would be impossible.    So of course Team Trump wants to murder the thing.   And of course there's a link to his own businesses involved here, because the program also includes voluntary scoring of commercial real estate buildings.        Guess what?       Trump's properties tend to receive low Energy Star ratings. The most recent scores from 2015 reveal that 11 of his 15 skyscrapers in New York, Chicago and San Francisco are less energy efficient than most comparable buildings.   Trump wants to kill the program because Trump profits.  Trump, fascist con man.

0,"Trump says the military is locked and loaded, but he's also previously said his first order as President was to """"renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal” and “it is now far stronger and more powerful than ever.” which had been widely reported to be just another false claim from the habitual liar who is the POTUS.  Basically what we have is two of the world's most ridiculed and ridiculous heads of state in a hyperbole slinging contest.

He made two great additions to his team .   His detractors and the poor losers he beat keep saying he's done---and here he still is.  Trump is exactly what America needs . His first action as president should be to put Hillary Clinton in prison .   Just wait until his advertising starts taking effect and the leaks come out about Clinton.  He may win in a landslide.

Aside from the threat to a woman's right to choose, this march, and the numerous marches against Trump around the country and THE WORLD are due to his clear objectification, sexual abuse, and general stalking of women, a pattern that has existed in him for years. WOULD YOU LEAVE YOUR (ATTRACTIVE) DAUGHTER IN A ROOM ALONE WITH OUR NEW PRESIDENT? I most certainly would not, since I don't believe she would be safe, and that is why you most certainly would have been welcomed at that march. It's not about walking in lock step-everyone doesn't feel the same way about everything, but sexual predators are a universal issue that women can support each other in. Get real.

0,"The problem is the rural Trump voters' lack of interaction/socialization with minorities has lead to fear of them. All these folks have to go on as far as minority experiences are the regurgitations of people like Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and tv shows like Cops. They don't actually interact with any non-whites on a day-to-day basis. Everything they are reading/watching is reinforcing the fearful/prejudice stereotypes they already possess. It's the same reason we are having so many unarmed black people shot during """"routine"""" police stops. The white police officers have no history of minority interaction and are thrown into minority districts on patrol. With no experience to draw on this leads to fear which leads to quick trigger fingers. The article is correct in it's one main point - Trump expertly tapped into this """"white fear"""" and executed a clear path to the Presidency due largely to stoking those fears.

He tried to set this up while the Trump administration was in transition, not in office yet.  Trump's transition team had NO BUSINESS attempting this since they were not the ones in power.  Every intelligence head (current & former) have said this is very concerning.  The only ones pooh-poohing this behavior is McMaster and Kelly, both Trump lackeys.

Large corp law breakers will have their taxes RAISED to 50+% for length of time TBD. **Proceeds to be distributed to border enforcement - wall construction. D) Small businesses who violate law are subject to stiff fines penalties. E) Tax ALL repatriation via electronic transfers to foreign countries who refuse to take back their citizens (essential all).  10-15 million Illegals will pack up and leave when there is no longer LEGAL work for them.

0,"This Popular Vote vs Electoral College Vote issue is growing old.  Both candidates campaigned fully aware that the winner is determined by the electoral vote tally.  Candidates would campaign differently if the outcome was determined by a popular vote.  (e.g. Trump would have spent more time in the more heavily populated states than he did.)  Why is that so difficult to understand?  Trump ran a better electoral college based campaign.  No one can tell how the popular vote totals would have been had he campaigned as such.  It does appear the Hillary ran a popular vote type campaign, which she won,  while losing the election.

In other words, commonsense is the epitome of liberal (small l, liberal) thought.  The word you were looking for to express Trump was regressive conservatism.

Who first began calling his Republican running mates names? Trump! Who first began accusing Democratic opponents at will? Trump! And the list goes on with Trump right up there. Only after Trump used verbal attacks, did opponents hit back. He didn't like it and his family began putting the blame on THEM. He continues to behave ungodly and without fear of impunity. If not for all of THAT, he might have come across with a degree of credulity. As it is, Obama was bucked from his """"DAY ONE"""" by Haters and Trump has continued that hate by issuing Executive Orders to undo Obama. Now that the shoe is on his foot, he cries and cries and cries. BTW, stop lamenting. Tell Trump to perform his Job Description. Repectfully Yours, ME!

0,"It is hilarious for Trump haters to abhor the power of a US president when a PM in our parliamentary system with a majority government has a 4 year dictatorship while the president has all manner of checks and blocks to his agenda by both houses of congress.  Trump was acting legally and appropriately in his targeted strike on the Syrian airfield from which the jets were launched.  A president may not wage full scale war without congressional approval but as commander in chief he has the legal authority to undertake temporary, limited military action.  After 6 years of doing nothing by Obama and the UN it is appropriate for someone (realistically meaning the US president) to resist and begin reversing the slaughter of 500,000 and the displacement of 6 million Syrians.  Sending the signal there is a new sheriff in town is a necessary cautionary act to intimidate dictators around the globe.  May you overcome (as well as over comb).  P.S. Hillary advocated this about 2 hours before launch

What does Trump do? Blows up the rule to allow a simple majority to win. This makes the process more open to abuse and wild partisan swings on the SC.  Illegal immigration down 60% Not sure that's true but you'd have to prove that illegal immigration is bad for the US first. In fact, illegal immigrants are a huge part of the US economy and overall beneficial. Fear-mongering and racism aside.  China is not squeezing NK.

If you asked any fair-minded person whether or not a politician should release their taxes, they would say yes, regardless of party (and rightfully so). This frustrates me so much. It's not just you (I'm guilty as well). But seriously, can we please just be consistent? You know if it were Hillary refusing to release her taxes, you would have a problem with it. Yet, look at the convoluted rationalization you give for Trump. And you can certainly have reason for disliking Obama's policies, but they should be grounded in fact.  He cut the deficit by half of what it was when he took office. You can argue it should've been more, or that he wasn't fully responsible for that, but can we please move beyond partisan hackery and stop exaggerating and tell the truth?

0,"The takeaway from the economic libertarianism debate is that capitalism is not a free market system - it is a system of market advantage over workers and consumers.  At such, it should never be bapitzed by the Catholic Church.  This is different from social libertarianism, which posits that on moral questions the individual must chose his own path and that the best path is humanistic rather than theistic, because morality was made for man, not for God.  If only Rome would understand that.  I think Francis does.  Low turnout may not help Trump, since it may be Republican voters who stay home.  Democratic women will be flocking to the polls.  Another form of atonement is Tasla, to cast yours sins upon the waters and confess them to family member or friends whom you have wronged.

The press is indeed supposed to """"take on"""" anyone in public office, even for policies the individual news outlet dislikes, and not just crimes and misdemeanors. That is the duty of the Fourth Estate, to inform its readers. Of course we have right-wing media who ignore or deny missteps by their favored politicians.

And most sociopaths can lie with such charm and grace that most people never question if the person is telling the truth. In fact, this is probably the most recognizable sign of a sociopath: they lie so much that once they’re found out, it’s hard to know if they had ever told the truth"""".

Real Americans understand how both of those statements can be true. It has to do with the Constitution and the way the courts have consistently interpreted it.

And yet, in the article, she continues to incite the right of a democracy. Is she for or against the “mob mentality” of democracy?

The Federal Land Management and Policy Act of 1976 clearly says the Secretary of Interior can’t do any shrinking.  But it’s not clear from the law’s wording if the president can do so.  A legislative report issued by the House committee that considered FLPMA when it was just a bill is clear about lawmakers’ intent, stating that the act was drafted with the idea that it “specifically reserve to the Congress the authority to modify and revoke withdrawals for national monuments created under the Antiquities Act.”  Expect this, like all Trump's initiatives, to be shut down and rejected by the courts.

It's like ridings in rural Alberta going 88% to the PCs back in the day. 13% would win the riding, and the other 75% is essentially wasted.  b) She lost too many votes with ethnic voters that Obama won. When Trump goes UP with ethnic voters over Mitt Romney, it's a notable shift.  But, she also salted her own wound and ran an essentially sexist campaign. What man wouldn't think twice about voting for her when she proposes a more 'sensitive' criminal justice system ... just for women? When her supporters are lambasting 'Bernie Bros' for being sexists during the primaries? When she has a history of making mind-numbing statements like women and children always being the primary victims of war? Don't sell me sexism as equality.

0,"Integrity and intellect take on inanity, ignorance and deceit. Which character (or lack thereof) will win out?  The catch 22 is that even if Mueller finds criminality, a sitting president (supposedly) can't be charged. So accountability is down to Congress - but therein lies the rub. Unlike Nixon who faced a Democratic congress, this president is protected by a phalanx of Republicans. A few are honest and hold honest - if terribly backward - beliefs. But many are beholding to big money and subservient to special interests (which puts them on common ground with Trump).  Fifty percent of the House is daunting enough but two-thirds of the Senate is highly improbable  - unless, of course, public outrage is so intense that next year's elections dramatically change the water on the beans.  How more fitting then that the choice of fixing this enormous mistake should ultimately come down to the people who made it in the first place - the electorate . We wait with bated breath.

He chose to trust the Russians, and that decision appears to have worked well, at least for nerve agents like saran, until now. Strangely, despite Trump's blaming Obama, Trump's  action can be seen as a continuation of the Obama policy (the Russians failed to keep their promise, so time to try the alternative option), and indeed one might argue that Obama's action has increased the legitimacy of Trump's action in the eyes of the world (the US tried restraint and trusted Russia; that failed so not is the time to bomb).

Therefore, removing the rule actually is more likely to harm the GOP in the long-run.  In the case of Gorsuch, the Democrats also played to their base. They kept the """"resist"""" movement alive and engaged, and Democrats are a base that is fickle with their elections: if they're engaged they show up to vote. Now facing down 2018 mid-terms, with a GOP president that is massively unpopular, even with his own party, Democrats see a chance to keep the """"resist"""" movement engaged and get them into voting booths to seize back at least one chamber of Congress, at which point Trump's agenda grinds to a halt.

On a tactical level the fact that Trump spent all his time flying up and down the rust belt and Florida (the so called 13 battleground states) and targeted his advertising in the key states of the Rust Belt meant he had a stronger instinct of what he needed.  Clinton was in Louisiana in the last week of her campaign - her campaign advisors gave her bad advice.  Other indications of serious mistakes came from indications that Bill Clinton was warning her team that they need to talk to the working class in the rust belt.  They laughed at Bill.

0,"Oopsie. There goes another one.  During his campaign for president, Donald Trump sounded a lot like Bernie Sanders on one policy issue: He promised to implement sweeping government reform to lower drug prices and called Big Pharma executives “disgusting” for profiting off life-saving medication. It was a campaign pledge that earned Trump some praise for his apparent populism. But it’s not one that Trump seems prepared to keep. According to reporting from Kaiser Health News and Politico, the Trump administration’s task force working on policy solutions for rising drug prices is now cozying up to pharmaceutical industry interests.
"
0,"In all honesty the only way the readers here would be comfortable with any investigation is if Trump were allowed to investigate himself or just fire Mueller and be done with it. Trump could literally tell most of his supporters that he doesn't poop and has never lied and you all would either believe him or excuse him and say that he only said those things because he is inexperienced and an outsider. How can anyone give this guy credibility with so many obvious lies tied to him? How can you listen to calls for draining the swamp and then see it filled even higher? How can you see people lie to congress and its okay? You wouldn't take that from a democrat, but you will from Trump and team?

0,"Okay Paul, good post.  Yes, this editorial is partly good, the part about stereotyping etc.  But it was still the same old libber condemnation of Trump himself that has led me to stereotype liberals as intolerant, self-centered individuals.  The quotes recounted above are not from, imho, good people.  The trouble is that those libbers believe they are good people, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The quotes recounted reveal people with zero tolerance for anything but their worldview.  They reveal people who regard their judgment and interpretation as absolute with no apparent recognition that they may be mistaken or that other viewpoints may have equal or greater validity.  This is what has pushed me to contempt of the """"libber"""" worldview.  All the usual libber chants such as care for all races, the poor, the sick, the disadvantaged, etc. concern me greatly, yet I do not view Trump as the libbers do.  Just thinking about libber attitudes of superiority makes me sick.

He has shown us that it is a good idea if the president knows the difference between a multinational corporation and a democratic republic and that few of us do either!

Trump's proposed budget (which won't be adopted) says how much he has the common man in mind - very little.  All of that is equally in danger under either one.

1,"I've been saying for many many years that the two party system has failed and is bringing the country down with it.  Looking at the presidential election provides all the evidence I need to make my case.  While the endless Clinton email fiasco goes into yet another round, Trump faces two court dates within a month after the election: one for fraud and the other for raping a child.  In other words, regardless of who wins next week, the person taking office as president come January will be under active criminal investigation.  That's a first.  Yet partisans on both sides are proclaiming the innocence of their own candidate before the evidence is in and declaring the other guilty for certain, again before the evidence is in.  No one is discussing how we reached this point in the first place.  Do you honestly want to make America great again?  Step one is tearing your party registration to shreds.  As long as you remain a partisan, you are part of the problem.

The British empire found it necessary to start WW1 and WW2 (yes the Brits started them, not the BS you read in history books) when empire was in steep decline. Will the U.S. start WW3? It will try.

0,"Your original snide remark was better and yes it is based on Keynesian economics. Keynes was discredited because he could not find a way to deal with institutional debt in his model. We had growth and recession in deficits. However, if you adjust the deficit with the net interest paid you factor that in and analysis can occur. Because of how money is disbursed, you have to lag the effect (growth) one year and must do a separate curve for each tax regime. The Bush regime ended when ATRA was passed in 2013. Since then growth went from 1% per year to over 2% per year for the last 3 or 4 years. If Trump passes nothing (a good assumption) he will not make things worse, even though the credit belongs to Barack. As for my law, I make no claims to be a lawyer but I understand constituional pretty well, having had classes at the undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels.

There are too many checks and balances that, we hope, will prevent such an evolution, though they might fail.

Does this suggest that the people who designed the Affordable Care Act were insane?  Also, I've heard rumors that life insurance providers charge more to old people than to young people for the same coverage.  But why let facts ruin a good narrative.

Made up, phony facts. Too bad!” So, it could be that the G&M are lying, since they provide no other source for their own statement. It could also be that James Clapper expressed himself differently to Trump than they did when speaking in an official manner, at some as-of-yet not cited (in this article) presentation.

0,"As a politician campaigning for public office Trump is a laughing stock.  I seriously doubt he'd know the laws pertaining to his office if he were elected POTUS---which would make the steady erosion of checks on the Executive under both Bush and Obama a dangerous trend indeed.  Hillary Clinton is both knowledgeable and experienced, having devoted her life to public service.  Republicans hate her and her husband for being better republicans than they are, and savvier politicians.  It's also about time for a woman to be president, and under the current metric, Clinton is by far the most qualified candidate to run for office in a long time.  That said, she is also firmly part of a shift to the right in American politics which has been going on since before Reagan, engineered by her sponsors on Wall St.:  The Dems have thunderously abandoned working people and progressives in the process, and many of them have gone over into crazy land with Trump---They have only themselves to blame for it

Another 51 of those statements were deemed to be only half true. When it was all said and done, only 4% of what Donald Trump said was determined to be completely true.” No politician they’ve ever evaluated has been so dishonest. That’s staggering.

The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which approved the investment; Clinton did not participate in the CFIUS decision. The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Ultimately, only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangement.

Anything less is dull by comparison -- and even worse, requires acceptance of official explanations in an age when secretive governments (i.e. all of them) have brought endless suspicion upon themselves. Shenon's more recent book is revealing re- Mexico/Cuba; Bugliosi's epic might be close to definitive, with the """"Rosetta Stone"""" of the Itek photo. Oswald's fleeing the scene and murdering a Dallas cop was not the behaviour of an innocent man; his own brother Robert, visiting him in jail, grew convinced of Lee's guilt; the so-called magic bullet needed no magic, its path logical in honest appraisals. But if observers years ago could denounce actual evidence and contrive their own, imagine what they might do today with all the hi-tech available.

Used to be, for those self same evangelicals, even one divorce would summarily disqualify a candidate, but today, with Trump, they don't care if he runs through wives like some people do the number of new cars they might buy. And the boasting and admitted perverted sexual predation? LIke Trump didn't boast and admit his crime. Sexual perverts should pay for their crimes. Period. As one, as a society we should condemn them and not allow them to escape punishment. But, if you're a right winger, you only act like you're outraged if it's not a right winger caught in their perversions. No better example of the right's hypocrisy

0,"Streep is entitled to her opinions, obviously, and she was not shy about expressing them in a public forum that shouldn't have anything to do with politics. However, she clearly declared her political allegiance when she appeared as a speaker at the Democratic Party convention. So, this was not just a neutral, unbiased observer. Secondly, making an anti-Trump speech in front of a Hollywood audience takes no courage at all - it is an easy way to make news and score cheap points in front of an uncritical audience which already agrees with you. More importantly, this type of speech is not only one-sided, but also very selective in its use of facts. For example, Trump was against illegal immigration, and did not, to my knowledge, say anything against foreign citizens legally working in Hollywood. So, linking the two is intellectually dishonest. And finally, Streep, just like Clinton before her, had no problem casually putting down millions of Trump voters in her """"inclusive"""" speech.

His only criteria is how well a person sucks up to him, and,  incredibly, he seems to have gone out of his way to pick the least qualified for each cabinet post, as if daring anyone to criticize.  He doesn't like the press because they shine light on action he believes should be his private business, unaware that the office of President brings responsibility along with power.   There are a frightening number of people in this country who agree with him.  Spreading fake news is the first step in discrediting and muzzling real journalism, on the way to totalitarianism.

Not to say that people don't write about the under 25s.  It's just that usually, the writers are much older than those they write about.  Good to hear from you.  2. You wrote it, got it published and you're female. Outspoken females appear to be """"trending."""" I recall  watching an ABC TV interview with four miners on their opinions of Pres. Trump's stance on coal. All coalminers interviewed were...women.  No men. Blew me away. It's the same elsewhere. Students volunteers with elderly? GIRL students. FN people want to state their views?  Aboriginal women outnumber those speaking by a wide margin.  So, question: what's the Alliance's male-female ratio...and why, do you think?  3. You skipped a step. Between cursive writing and coding is...keyboarding (once called typing). And that's all many of us--like me--need to embrace.

Jeff Sessions is about to destroy voting rights for minorities in America. Et cetera.  Trump is not only unknowledgable, but is disinterested in becoming knowledgeable. (Look at his idiotic phone call with Taiwan. Look at his ignorance on Crimea and Ukraine. Look at his wilful ignorance in not wanting to get Intel briefings.

The odds of being killed by a refugee or an asylum seeker in the USA are infinitely lower than being killed accidentally by a toddler playing with one of the 350 million or so guns being left on car seats, couches and kitchen tables. In the past 10 years, about 70 people have been killed by terrorists in the US as compared to nearly 375,0000 killed by just normal gun violence (toddlers under age 3 shoot someone about once a week in the US).  With the election of Donald Trump, the USA is shedding everything it stands for and what made it great. Sadly, the """"great"""" America will be gone.

The Rob Ford phenomenon, or now the Donald Trump phenomenon, is only possible in a society that has no knowledge or appreciation of its own history.  A society that has no appreciation of history or literature is also a society that has no ability to understand why it is important to elect governments that make decisions based on evidence.

Oh, and men, Christian and secular alike, would accept a regime where only the elite were allowed to have sex.  You also have to believe that Trump, Congress, the military, the courts, and law enforcement are all religious fanatics that still somehow have decided to reject 2000 years of religious teachings on marriage, tenets that are held by many Jews and Muslims as well as Christians.

The question is what the next step is to add to the pressure and that would be more action by China to quickly stop trading with North Korea.

The atrocities of Aleppo, were brought about by the terrorists muslims  (supported buy the left in the USA)  that took over the city.  The """"flood waters of populism"""" you refer to is actually a wave of common sense.  Islamic State does not direct or inspire these attacks, islam does.  The comment """" these are Merkel's dead"""" might be disgusting to you but to the rest of us the murder of 12 infidels by a muslim that Merkle welcomed with open arms is far more disgusting.  As a liberal it must have been difficult for you to write """" Germany needs some more surveillance"""" but in actual fact germany needs fewer muslim.  Trump is not an """"outward blister"""" he is the PEOTUS and will represent the people.  How liberal of you to bring up Adolf Hitler, but at the very least you should point out the AH got along very well with muslims as they hate the same people and have the same ideas when it comes to eradication.

I voted for him. Later he lied under oath-that is the 'should impeach' factor. His cheating, nah, between him and the wife. Didn't interest me at all. Only the lie to Congress.

0,"Fact: Consumption of cannabis does not act directly on the brain stem, which affects motor coordination, unlike alcohol which does. The push by law enforcement to find a way around this fact is to shore up the flagging income generated by the failed and trumped up War on Drugs which has always been predicated on a foundation of igorance and fear based propaganda. The real crime of the War on Drugs is the falsely based governmental policies that have created a monster of a prison industry and incalculable needless pain and suffering to generally harmless American citizens. Not to mention the fact that prohibition as a policy has never worked and merely serves to create black markets and related territorial violence. It's a massive governmental policy disgrace wherever it rears its monstrous head. Finally, chocolate, caffeine, and sugar are all technically psychoactive substances. Where are the campaigns of fear? A ridiculous notion? Well, yes, of course. And so it is with cannabis.

The beauty of a democratic republic is that no matter how much the Chief Executive may engage in demagoguery, there are always checks and balances to keep him/her in line.

In other words, it was someone telling the story of what they saw, what they had heard, what had happened to them. It was focused in Clinton and America, and it was just him speaking from his heart.  By contrast, Trump's acceptance speech had 117 instances of """"I,"""" """"me"""" and """"my"""" in it. Given that it was a little longer, you would have to expect more occurrences.  As neither speech was discussing an abstract proposition, but was dealing with something fairly personal, you'd have two expect about that proportion of self-references. Trump is pushing his own agenda and persona; Obama is discussing his experience of Clinton and changes of the last 7 years. On the basis of word occurrences, neither seems narcissistic.

And, stop blaming Trump for this.  The President of the U.S. does not have power over what a city does or what different groups or individuals do.  As I recall, the Occupy movement was pretty violent in Seattle, vandalizing private property and threatening anyone who got in their way.  Did you know the individual who organized and got the permit in Charlottesville was in the Occupy movement only a few short years ago?  What we have are many young people who have not been taught honest history and the lessons to be learned from it.  They have, instead, been asked their opinions since they were 2, and adults have done their bidding.  That is what they all act like.  Marching around and protesting and carrying weapons is no way to change things you may disagree with.

He certainly would not of been for interfering with foreign affairs, i.e. A constant state of global war. He certainly would not be for taxing working class, giving loopholes for rich to not pay taxes, and allow for a system that has so much walefare. He certainly would not of been for trade deals that make moving businesses overseas more profitable than creating employment in the states. He certainly wouldn't be for the communistic style of democracy where government decides what we consume and punishes people for their consumption choices.

0,"According to some, Trump has already accomplished a lot of what he said he would when campaigning.  The border wall (who had some funding appropriated several congresses ago), getting some new insurance plans made available without all the nonsense Obamacare required in the plans and being able to sell them across state lines (in addition to making them legal now which they were not under Obama!), new relationship with Iran, out of the new world order of the UN and looking at welfare reform (needs to be) among other things!

Even if tRump and the Repugs double the standard deduction (from approximately $6400 now) to around $12,000 for individuals, that is useless if they eliminate the $4050 personal exemption. That means the actual allowable amount that you can deduct remains closely the same. Do the math. If you add the fact that other deductions will be taken from you, leaving only mortgage interest and charity, how do you figure you will come out ahead?  Ron the Con Raygun pulled the same thing in the 1980s. How did that work for the middle class? It didn't.  The Repugs are pulling another con job, just like health care.

What would make a difference is to stop creating the conditions which produce large numbers of refugees in the first place.  Trump was not in office when the conditions for producing masses of refugees came into being.  Probably the best thing he can do for refugees is to promote a wind down in the wars in the Middle East.

The Air Force is capable of creating emergency control towers. And now Trump Tweets that the Puerto Ricans always want hand-outs. He didn't whine about Texans and Floridians who needed disaster assistance whining about handouts after Irma. Maybe it's because TX and FL have electoral votes?

Barring that, a half hour PBS special extolling Oregon's style of democracy would be very useful. Of course, vote by mail would change the electoral landscape, as democracy and its one person one vote, gerrymandering aside, would construct a new United States. Even I, a proponent of strict one person one vote, don't know what would happen. More Trumps? Go Bernie. Hugh Massengill, Eugene

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Mueller probably already has his tax returns.

0,"I watched the entire short speech of President Trump which was preceded by an introduction by the Secratary of Veterans Affairs and an introduction of legislation designed to improve health care for veternans.    It was a strange and very Trump-like speech.  His portion began thanking the veterans and wanting to shake the hands of the """"fellas"""" (there was one woman in the group of veterans believe it or not), and then he entered his remarks re: Charlottesville.  And, to be fair, while his phraseology is typically odd, and his stated notion that this has been going on a long time between lots of sides was off-putting and odd, there was, nonetheless, a very clear message that all Americans need to love each other.  You can believe that's what he truly wants or not, but there is no denying that was what he said.  He said """"ALL Americans"""" without categorizing any of groups or sides.  It's hard to argue from that point that he wasn't clear or that he supports white supremacists.

0,"Perhaps he intends to ignore the intel wienies who have such an abysmal record of failure going all the way back to 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya?  He has his Vice President taking the interim briefings until his new National Security Advisor selects the ones he prefers.  Co-opting the incoming 'new guys' is an ancient bureaucratic trick; Trump has undoubtedly seen that attempt in business bureaucracies.  The intel wienies and State Department lifers attempts to do the same are not likely to succeed.  Other Federal bureaucrats might want to check their retirement portfolios in lieu of 'business as usual' IMO.  His biggest problem will be his inability to fire the losers who have homesteaded the offices for so long.

It is not important what exact words were used because different people use different words.  The point is he took the time to call.  The intent of the call was clear.  The family involved knows that comfort was intended even if they did not like the words.  It is the media who has taken this much too far.  It was the media harping on the matter that engaged Trump to reply about Kelley as he should to disclose lies about Obama.  Now it is time to for the press to show some respect for all of us and stop inciting outrage over what clearly is good intent.

Trump's campaign of emphasizing aggressive nationalism and racism by closing borders, deporting people, and withdrawing into an isolationsist stance in regards to trade and treaty agreements is the very definition of a fascist movement. His remarks about solving street crime problems on the day he's elected sounds a lot like a declaration of martial law in the making. Article 1, Section 9 confers the title of Commander in Chief upon the President, giving him the power to do so, although it would likely trigger a Constitutional crisis.  Trump is a demagogue of the worst kind: narcissistic, impulsive,egocentric, and sociopathic.

0,"“A Trump security advisor that the world was an arena, not a global community” is a new twist on the role of a country’s government. Isn’t the role of a government in a democratic country to act and work in the public interest? The general public has the right to vote a government out of office if it feels that its collective interests are not being served. There is always a ying and yang to every political decision that pleases some and angers others.  This is the second time that I heard that the US competes with other countries for military and economic advantage. It is an honest admission and explains a lot of things. US policy has shifted from a global view to a self-interested “Make America Great Again.” There is no sharing or caring. It’s a winner take all game. Let’s go make money and create jobs reflects Trump’s political objective and environmental policy.  Do the majority of the general American public share Trump’s values?

It creates a phantom enemy to rally its citizens against, to have a common enemy to keep the ruling family and its henchman in power   Past discussions to reduce this problem have only made it worse, as North Korea merely uses the time to continue down the path  toward nuclear feasibility.  Trump has at least tried harder to do the one diplomatic thing that really has any chance at success, that is to convince China to put more economic and political pressure on North Korea.  This may be the only hope of a peaceful solution.  But  I am not convinced that KJU cares about economic sanctions that only hurt the average citizen of NK.

Along the same lines, European countries marvel at the relative ease in which Canada can bring in tens of thousands of Syrians compared to the chaos in their own countries. What they don't know is the secret seems to be to limit the influx to orphans, families and homosexuals. You would be stupid to let that info out. You've already gotten your headlines.

Hard work DID allow many to progress, but racism, sexism, and various prejudices have held back many who otherwise should have done better if hard work was the only factor.  The consumer mentality that glorified material possessions ahead of community wellbeing, contributed to the """"I'm in this for ME, and only ME"""" mentality, which in turn meant that buying the cheapest goods was more important than ensuring a healthy community with jobs for all.  The income disparity that allows a few to prosper at the expense of the many, is a cancer that eats into any societal good will and willingness to work for the common good.  The wildly partisan jockeying for power and influence is similarly undermining a sense of common purpose.  Trump isn't the answer to these issues.

Then the last week or so, things are changing again ,and it's all back up  in the air, and back we go again to present our case. Mulroney was brought on board because of his past connections, and while this doesn't hurt, a president, and a country doesn't change its trade policy because of one man.

0,"Trump didn't say ALL Mexican immigrants were drug dealers or rapists, he said SOME were. And that's obviously true, and few had been speaking out. It may seem divisive to some, and some may have been glad to hear it, that doesn't make it untrue.  We have more immigrants in our nation than any other on earth, in the neighborhood of 46,000,000 out of a population of 320,000,000.  So some consideration of whom to admit is obviously in order.  And with the law requiring that immigrants not become 'public charges,' yet millions of immigrants not self-supporting, the question naturally arises, how many more and from where?  A welfare state with open borders invites bankruptcy. And Mr. Trump appeals not only to the 'older white voters,' but to many others, including thousands in our our State of Hawaii. I saw the voting lines and they weren't all, not even most, 'older white voters.'  Every color in the rainbow is getting tired of the current regime and its colorless opponents.

Secondly, when it came time to defend the president’s proposed immigration reforms, the White House decided to give that job to Stephen Miller, who not only did so by fanning the culture war flames, he also sent out clear dog whistles to his white nationalist friends that this administration stands with them.

Fast forward six months and neither he, nor any of the other Obama alphabet agencies were surprised to see Russian fingerprints all over the DNC server and the Pedesta hack.  Of course none actually examined it.  They took the word of Democrat hired private IT people (who took the fifth during congressional testimony).  My guess is that the Trump-Russia collusion story, which disclosed emails confirming what everyone already knew...mainly Bernie was cheated), was intended to make it appear that Russia preferred Trump.  And the Obama administration assisted in that effort.

The Justice department, CIA, and NSA are all headed by presidential appointments.  As for US jobs and Carrier, we have the highest corporate tax of any developed nation (35%).  It just makes sense to lower it (which Trump will do) and you will see significant growth in our economy.  Remember - corporations don't really pay tax.  It is an expense that they pass on to the consumer.  If they can operate off-shore at a lower cost, it only makes sense.

0,"Alceste: Well, at least you appear to understand the weakness of your own argument. People in relatively prosperous Western democracies don't generally vote on the basis of single issues and seldom vote on the basis of a broadly-based cultural backlash, although Trump's victory may represent a partial exception to this. During our last federal election, polling indicated strong support for Harper's stance on the niqab but this didn't translate into voter support for Harper's government or party. Also, his party's defeat probably didn't alter or signify a change in the underlying discontent about cultural and religious accommodation in this country. The Trudeau government's early desire to massively increase immigration intake levels was thwarted by the public's overwhelming rejection of the idea, as indicated by polling. One shouldn't overestimate the importance of election results in Western countries where policy issues seem to intersect with broader cultural undercurrents.

It is dangerous to assume the Kim leaders are only crazy and irrational. Since 1990, they've seen the dictators of numerous non-nuclear nations be overthrown or killed. So, the Kims are creating a form of insurance policy. Plus, Kim Jong-Un isn't fazed at all by Trump's bombast. He simply flings it right back in Trump's face, which Trump can't stand. So, both sides are now engaged in a testosterone fight. I hope one side knows when to stop. I don't know if Trump can. And you're fine with it.

I recall that several years ago Bishop Estate (now renamed Kamehameha Schools) nearly lost its tax exemption because the IRS investigated and found that their economic profit-making through land investments in Hawaii and the mainland, together with their corrupt political activity in Congress and the state legislature, were the majority of what they were doing.

The Republicans advertised for an old-timey loudmouth who lies easily, and the job was duly filled. You're seeing what happens when you race for the bottom of the barrel:  you get there. Surprise!

He's never even read the majority of policies he discusses, and he readily admits it. 4) He's as narcissistic as any person can be. He only speaks in front of his base crowd, and constantly urges them to cheer for him. 5) The 25th Amendment needs to be enacted soon to remove him from office. It's a dangerous time for America, and we need an intelligent, mentally stable person to make decisions that affect our citizens. 6) A mental evaluation seems very necessary, for Trump and anyone who thinks he's an effective leader.

Trump's budget indicated his priorities, but Congress, which by necessity must take a longer view and address the complex priorities of their constituents, passes something that's more realistic. And that's without getting into the byzantine Congressional authorization/appropriation process; what actually ends up being spent is another matter entirely. In the end, a lot of this hand wringing is political theater.

Coal will be an enormous energy source for some time because that ball was set in motion but the times they are achanging as more and more people become aware of how we have poisoned our earth, land, water and atmosphere. We can do better in spite of trumps backasswards notions that he will undo the EPA and recreate the coal jobs.

A real leader would offer support and reassurance. A real leader would talk about Puerto Rico instead of unimportant issues that involve zero suffering. A real leader would call for action and draw attention to this issue instead of worrying about peaceful protest.  What I was talking about was Trump's shameful display and lack of leadership this weekend. Go ahead and defend that.
"
0,"So you got out of the wrong side of the bed today?  You must realize that you are projecting yourself onto Trump.  It's not a nice picture you project.  What does that say about you.  If a person makes a call to comfort, it is reasonable to assume a clear intent to comfort.  Don't like to credit the man with compassion?  Then think of the down side to condescension.  Trump makes a condescending call and it is reported to the press.  Could even be that the recipient records the call, Trump wouldn't know.  Any condescending thing he might say could be exposed to the entire country.  He and his crew are not so stupid to think that making a condescending call could be disastrous.  I conclude both by virtue of taking the time to make the call and the devastating consequence of reports of condescension, that Trump did his best to provide support and condolence.  It is the duty of all of us to look on the good side of our fellow citizens.  It is the thought that counts and it is clear.

I switched over to that bastion of truth, FOX News, and within thirty seconds they had put it out there that this was a Moslem terrorist, making comparisons with previous attacks.  Now we are finding out that it was in fact a war vet. back from Iraq.  FOX 'News' is actually a very evil institution. It's currency is lies, distortion, debasement, racism and overt propaganda.

Why don't you?” Never said I didn’t – you did. Calling Trump “illegitimate” is a far cry from “discussing” a foreign organization in a US federal election. How come you don’t see that?  “As for his history as a civil rights leader, I don't recall him saying """"Look what I've done"""" here"""". Then you haven’t been listening.

Trump wanted to renegotiate NAFTA and start a trade war anyway. Might as well fire the first shot. What great news would that make globally if Canada draws the first line in the sand. Let the US send us their car parts produced using  coal power while we subsidize building the same more expensive car parts for the same ultimate price using hydro, wind, biomass and solar.

Donald Trump is not a 7 year old boy, he is a 70 year old business man who has spent his life manipulating municipal, state, and federal laws for personal enrichment.  By any measure, he has been successful and is turning this ruthlessness to national politics.  Further, while his message may have resonated with white supremacists, half of the population of the US are not members of a fringe group.  To treat Donald Trump as a seven year old or to dismiss half the country as racist rubes underestimates the gravity of the threat that the Democratic party faces.  Democrats have to look at why they could not reach out to millions of voters in the midwest who flocked to Donald Trump despite the fact that his conduct conflicted with their personal values.  Until they internalize this, they deserve to remain as the minority in both the Senate and the House and standing outside the fence of the Whitehouse.

The BoC is counting on a rational US response to real-time economic data showing that capacity constraints are already being tested without the proposed government spending, so they should forego fiscal policy for the time being, regardless of whatever campaign promises they made.  But here's the thing: the BoC is making the rational assumption even when it knows in its gut that the US will, to its eternal regret and with all the known damaging consequences, very likely destabilize their economy and cause untold suffering among the poor and working class with inflation and high interest rates.

0,"Doc, I have heard Trump speak and compared to his predecessor its absolutely scholarly.  Obama hesitated and 'choked' his way thru almost every news conference. He was so afraid to offend the 'thought police' in liberal land that he resorted to halted sentences, occasional  stuttering and the overly self -conscious effort at watching  his p's and q's  and it was painful to watch.  He knew it too.  I heard Obama say once, that the reason he was so cautious at speaking was to not cause alarm and panic in the world.  Trump has blown that theory away. It proves the old adage, 'Actions' still speak louder than 'words'. We had 8 years of a President who liked to draw a red line and when confronted, would just move the line backwards. Its what the world has come to expect. Soon though, the talk will end and  'action' will replace the words. North Korea and Iran will yearn for the good old days of 'talk'. Its not too late for them, though, to start behaving and shape up.

There is very little he's done that the Courts, Congress and even his own cabinet members haven't struck down, watered down or walked back. And we know he claims even tiny gains, or bad legislation, as victories. So he may well do so in trade, because he's a transactional president who lives for things he can claim as victories, even if they aren't.

Now, all of a sudden, the focus is on the Russians. Ironically, some people who now claim to want transparency about the computer hacking, are also unhappy that e-mails from the DNC were made available to the public, showing such things as the cooperation between the Clinton campaign and the DNC against Sanders, for instance. To my knowledge, the accuracy of these e-mails was never disputed, so some Clinton supporters are presumably mad that voters learned the truth before voting.

""""  Do you want to know what correlates much better with those numbers? Check out the list of terrorist incidents on Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents#1970.E2.80.93present  Look at how it starts with 1 year per page (with not too many per year) to needing one page for each 6 months, and then one page per month, with several incidents per day now. This was accelerating long before Trump became involved in politics.

1,"I was born and raised in Maine. I've lived here in Alaska for over 30 years and touch base with friends and family on a weekly basis there. Susan Collins does not represent her constituents. She is self serving just like the majority of our US Senators, Congressmen and women. Had Bernie Sanders been chosen then folks from Maine would have voted for him overwhelmingly. They hate Hillary like the plague and would vote for Donald just to keep her out of office. I wouldn't be surprised to see Susan Collins elected right out of her position if she is up for re election. I honestly think that folks in Maine just like everywhere else are getting tired of the same old crap in Washington and you may see a huge number of votes for Gary Johnson in place of all of them. I know I am seriously contemplating this myself given Mr. Trumps character and crooked Hillary's record.  We will all be sorry this election if Hillary wins. Get out and vote folks.

Where was karl rhodes and the protestors when we did this? Has it dawn on anyone maybe a female homeless person feels safer in waikiki vs chinatown or a alley where people get assaulted. They wanted safe haven too but he banned them becuase they arent the right color.. we are hippocirtes and we jump on band wagons but we do it too!!

0,"You just noted that Syria was so chaotic (a very mild term for the place), that this chaos, and the threat it posed to American citizens, was the reason behind Obama's temporary immigration restriction actions.   The 6 other nations on Obama's list are also chaotic hotbeds of people who have stated they hate the West and want to kill Westerners for the sake of their religion.  So I don't understand how Obama's temporary ban is justified, while Trump's temporary can be said to be born out nothing but bigotry and pure hatred.  Both presidents operate in an era where Muslim terrorism is a fact.   Both recognize 7 nations where this terrorism is prevalent.   Neither of us likely has info for an informed opinion whether those visas assured proper vetting.   There are some matters that we have to trust to elected officials and intelligence agencies.  A president's #1 job is protecting American citizens, and given ISIS it's very difficult.  They are due their power to make bans.

Having aided and abetted Trump's rise, it is reaping the sorry results for itself - a knock-out blow to all those who persist in imagining Putin a master strategist.  In another generation or so, once the next wave or two of kleptocrats have looted the diminishing pot several times over, a Russian leader may finally arise who understands that Russia needs good relations with the West far more than the West needs good relations with Russia. Until then, geopolitical dwarves such as Putin will continue to run Russia - and run it into the ground.

Bill Clinton, a total slime ball, ran out of deferments and could not find a way to legally avoid the draft. In 1969 Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft and got a number.  When Trump ran out of legal ways to avoid the draft he did what any other coward with kiney would do, he cried to daddy. Daddy arranged a doctor appointment and SURPRISE, baby Trumpy got a golden ticket from the “doctor.” The Golden Ticket said that baby Trump has bone spurs. Not enough to keep him from golfing and sexually assaulting women, but enough to keep him from being drafted.

Just with every other scandal which has involved a POTUS it is rarely the crime that gets people caught, it is usually the cover-up.  That is why the Dossier is important, it was the only real piece of evidence which might have implicated Trump (which is why it was important to keep Mueller on track and pointed the right direction) and now appears that it may bury its funding source and it has the potential to open the other 2 items up and suck it Mueller, Comey, Lynch, Clinton (both of them), Rosenstien, and a number of Obama surrogates; and, like it or not Obama.

0,"IRT JMan, your evaluation is off base, period.  President Trump's base is made up of Middle America, as someone like me.  Following the polls, we can say President Trump has some 42% to 45% of the voting population committed to his agenda.  Beginning with that kind of support, whomever is the candidate on the GOP side, supported by President Trump, must work hard to gain the 6% to 9% to win in the General.  Being involved in a number of elections, it's a wonderful position to be having some 45% of the votes to be cast on your side.  Imua President Trump.  Oh, I'm Asian.

0,"First, Fake, that isn't quite what they said. Second, Fake, those were PUBLIC hearings. You have no idea what was revealed in closed hearings. Third, Fake, those hearings were weeks ago. It is very clear from Donnie Jr.'s now public email thread that there IS evidence. And you are naive if you don't think that the intel folks don't have much, much more than Donnie's email. And it's now proven that the Trump campaign had contacts with Russia for the specific purpose of getting """"dirt"""" from them. Calling the developing story """"fake news"""" was a lie repeated hundreds of times by Trump officials, Fox News, and many republicans. We know that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jeff Sessions, Michael Flynn ALL meet with various Russian entities during the campaign and lied about it. Why lie, Fake? Is it really all so innocent? I don't know and neither do you, but the FBI is all over it. But you hang on to your """"no evidence"""" blankie if it helps you get through this.

[Your opinion is no because racists have attributed """"status"""" to it. is that correct?] It is not because racists h ave attributed """"status"""" to it but to the message and purpose they were originally erected BY THOSE WHO ERECTED THEM.

0,"And, that's the problem with the tax system.  Financial resource that previously went to labor in order to sustain the sector of society that comprises """"labor"""", now bypasses and goes to that 2% (the owners of the mechanized processes, for instance), without any mechanism for that redirected wage resource to be used to sustain.  The """"Citizens United"""" characterized movement's con was that it was wise, good, and/or fair to permit that to happen.  Wages move away from the one broad group of humans, and down a bottlneck into the hands of a few.  It's why Trump supporters don't have enough money to pay for health insurance, and why government doesn't have the money to just provide it, no questions asked.  Government IS the answer to correcting that imbalance.  The answer is simply to take (or tax) the re-directed amounts and just put it back into the sustanence pool.  Not luxuries.  Sustenance.  There's simply no excuse for not doing so.

However, Trump had already made it clear that he appreciated Comey's help in defeating Clinton. <Better late than never.> Once Comey announced that there was an ongoing investigation of Trump's campaign, it was too late for Trump to fire him. He might have gotten away with it if he had simultaneously announced the nomination of a career law enforcement officer with impeccable credentials and no known political affiliations. The investigations continue. If you are a former prosecutor, you recognize that Trump is displaying the classic behaviors associated with a """"consciousness of guilt."""" In the Comey matter, he went beyond that: he told Lester Holt that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation, undercutting Pence, Spicer, Sanders, and Conway all of whom were vigorously lying for him a day earlier.

I cannot find that plausible.  You are talking about a guy who was so ingrained, so involved in his campaign and now his administration yet was somehow clueless of what went on under his very nose by his own handpicked executives and son in his campaign HQ.

0,"You have omitted several wars started by Democratic presidents. Clinton is a pawn, serving her needs via the wishes of the families who control the economy of the world. Trump is an outsider who has awakened a large segment of angered Americans. Neither are qualified or capable of the office of President of the United States if America. The system is failed due to uncontrolled financial contributions to favored candidates.  Then there is no system to qualify persons BEFORE they are allowed to run for any office. Nothing is ever perfect, but our system needs a major tune up. Following the Constitution is a good start. Build from the families and communities and on.

You small thinking people that think she should be only concerned about Hawaii are wrong.  If, by doing this, she can save American lives, including service personnel from Hawaii. then it'd well done. The problem Tulsi faces are from the liberal Dems who are against her for meeting with TRUMP. Though Obama said he would talk to anyone, that was OK because meeting with the heads of Terrorist States was not as bad as talking to a Republican President elect.  So sorry to say, Tulsi you will be facing the wrath of the liberal Democrats no matter what you do for a long time.  How regrettable for the citizens of Hawaii.  This needs to change before more is lost.

Trump is a worldwide phenomena especially in Europe where they are in the process of closing borders to foreign Trojan Horse invaders.

And why he wished Democrats would """"stop end-zone dancing on the 50-yard line"""" and get to work.  That leaves an underwhelming minority -- 23 percent -- of angry, 1950s-worshipping, Mad Men deplorables.

Congress fights with the mainstream media for the lowest of the public opinion on both parties and a Washington that is most dysfunctional.   Mr. Obama ran on """"change"""", and the people believed and wanted that change. I said from the first debate, no Mr. Bush, no Ms. Clinton, America wants change and both were anything but. I picked Donald Trump from the first debate, who from the very start exposed both parties when he admitted he had to give money as a businessman to both, including the Clinton's just to play the game, and get things done in business.   America rejected both parties, and today we have anything but a professional politician in office. Why? Because the people wanted change, real change. The politicians of both parties lost the presidency, both are losers in my opinion.

Can the U.S. continue to lead and pay to defend the world when healthcare is the leading domestic issue ? Will our swinging above our weight argument REALLY work this time? Trump is a simple concrete pourer that put on a suit to go on TV. He does understand the perception ,backed up by fact, that Canada has been a Defence mooch.

If the North Koreans have a warhead . . . they won't NEED an ICBM to deliver it. A Scud-type ballistic missile could reach any target in Japan or South Korea or the Sea of Japan.  That's the lesson of Iraq and Libya, both pariah nations that scrapped nuclear weapons programs and were then invaded by US-led coalitions that deposed the ruling regime. Well, that isn't going to happen in the DPRK; if Washington wants to depose Kim III, North Korea will have to incinerated, which would be to sacrifice whatever moral standing in the international community the US still has left after the agony of Iraq

Then let me know if my fears are unfounded. Please  read the remarks I made before Hooked Claw's remark. You may better get my point. What I sense is that there are people who are more afraid of appearing to discriminate against peaceful Muslims, than they are of Jihadist terrorist attacks. I was raised in the Middle East, attended an Egyptian University and socialized with Egyptians. The Principal of the Faculty of Science wanted me to marry his son.

That is, what evidence exists to warrant the investigation?

That is 800 THOUSAND jobs American Citizens DON'T have. The Democrats would have you believe that all 800 thousand are not taking jobs Americans want (we've heard that speech for years). Wrong (this is another falsehood told to the American people..They're not all picking strawberries they take good Jobs.Good enough jobs to buy homes, put their kids through college.  The GOAL (Democrats just haven't figured this out yet) is for the AMERICAN CITIZENS to be employed,sending their kid to college, buying homes and paying taxes. It's not the responsibility of the citizens of this country to support, educate citizens from other country's. Donald Trump said he is the """"Jobs President.""""

Quite reasonably, Trump doesn't want a criminally-insane fascist to have thermonuclear ICBMs.  But the problem is that Kim probably already has them in quantity and we have no effective ABM system.

Trump's threats on Canada's trade is an existential threat because of how much we rely on them. Trudeau is just doing what's necessary. We need to diversify our trade, or give US free reign to wreck our economy whenever they see fit.  FTA with the EU and China needs to happen at all costs at this point. Not sure Canadians realize how much risk we put ourselves in by relying so heavily on the US. North Korea needs China less than Canada needs the US based on these numbers alone.  (I have very little sympathy for Bombardier, but the US's little feet stomping is ridiculous given that the US subsidizes Boeing).

Fiscal irresponsibility and persistent tax risk are a major concern for many centrist voters.  And his team is built on identity first with merit as an afterthought.

He will be great in front of the cameras, but not in day to day policy, especially on defense and foreign policy.  The consumerist white voters who like reality TV got their wish.  They should be careful what they wish for (since the person they elected is not who will govern).

0,"Now everybody, let's be honest. Step out of your tribal political views for just a minute. We need some regulations but there are simply too many. Civilizations have always known that moderation is best. Even chocolate, icecream, sex, recreation, schooling, church, shooting your favorite gun, walking your favorite trail -- most things are best done not at zero or at ever-increasing amounts but somewhere in the middle. That works for regulations and taxes too. Not zero regulations. Not zero taxes. But not ever-increasing regulations or 100% taxes. I did not vote for Trump, but I have surely felt the sting of too many regulations, and frankly would rather not have my tax money spent on upholding all the regulations. Moreover, regulations are pernicious, established by bureaucrats rather than elected officials. Elected officials can be held accountable if we don't like their laws, but regulations are created under cover, without public oversight and yet they carry the power/force of law.

0,"As much as I would love to see Trump removed from office and deservingly so, I feel it is still wishful thinking on the part of the democrats.  Since the Republicans held the majority in both the Congress and Senate, they must have an enormous political will to let the impeachment to proceed no matter how much damage Trump will have done.  It will only come when enough of them feel the wrath of their constituents who is demanding it like in the case of Nixon and their job is at risk.  Then they will say they do it for the sake of the country and the party.  At this point, no such voice is coming from the 'red' districts.  Of course, thing can change quickly.  Who would have thought Trump's unraveling barely four months after he took office.  But the threshold for impeachment in terms of political will remains high.  If the Republicans lose big in 2018 mid term election, then the political will will come a lot easier.

0,"I suspect Trump doesn't care. Bernie Sanders pointed out after the election---in despair---that while Mr Trump was going to rallies in arenas in smaller centres in the mid west, Mrs Clinton was flying off to California for fundraisers with rich businessmen and show business  celebrities.  The fundraisers allowed her to run way more ads than Trump and  that may have helped her win the popular vote but the rallies she didn't stage in the midwest may have lost her the election. Clinton staged rallies in big cities in the midwest with rock stars and other sports and Hollywood celebrities to warm up the crowd, but  didn't even bother to show up in Wisconsin at all.  Trump was all over the midwest, and, as Bernie Sanders pointed out, went  all over Wisconsin.  Trump joked that he didn't need rock stars to fill arenas and said he had momentum. People didn't believe him, and I didn't either. Turned out he was right.

I maintain my belief that Comey was in a situation where there was no clear cut right or wrong decision and he would be criticized no matter what he did.

This is yet another example of the arrogance of JT in thinking that Canada is his private property to do with as he sees fit.  How dumb can you get!  Trump is doing for America what any good PM should be doing for Canada. Except that our PM ranks Canada secondary, merely a chattel , to the enrichment of his oligarchic friends and the Trudeau Foundation .  With no one of substance other than a former recycled and morally bankrupt PM of another party to negotiate for us, we are looking ill prepared and vulnerable to Trumps distaste for our PM and his bizarre and undiplomatic behaviour . Trudeau isn't bright enough to recognize the deficiencies in his leadership, a myopia founded on arrogance and contempt for political norms of ethical behaviour .  It will not end well

0,"During the Nixon presidency, there were some real patriots among the Republicans in congress.  That is why Nixon was held accountable, at least to the point of resignation. At this point, anyway, it's hard to see more than two or three Republican members who obviously care more about the country than about the party and their own careers. There may be more of them out there. I hope so. For now, though, the only way impeachment seems feasible is if/when Republican members sense that Trump's support has gone away. That could happen, it should happen, as Trump breaks one promise after another, strips health insurance from millions of people, embarrasses and weakens the country, and continues building a government of the filthy rich, by the filthy rich, and most of all for the filthy rich. All of these things will happen; whether they will make any difference to his supporters remains to be seen.

Impossible to fathom why the Globe would let her write an op-ed dumbing on Trump’s economic policies. Momani mentions the Dodd-Frank Act which created the position of head of supervision, responsible for Fed regulations. The position has never been filled formally. It has been filled unofficially by Fed Governor Dan Tarullo, who sees no conflict between his official duties and having an Obama bumper sticker on his car. A knowledgeable commentator on US economic policy would surely wait to see who Trump appoints to this position before weighing in on what financial regulation will look like under Trump. By the way, the US Fed has a dysfunctional target inflation indicator, as detailed in Baldwin's paper """"A Better Inflation Indicator"""" and that had a lot to do with the US financial meltdown, although it appears Momani is unaware of this.

Most of the time there was no two parent homes, just dysfunctional homes. No respect for education, just for what brutal activity can get them. No dad or other man in their lives mentoring them, so they turn to gangs for identity and validation. No one to help them find a purpose greater than themselves to strive for.

Hawaii's argument against Muslim Ban 2 was produced with fewer time constraints and takes a different tack.    If I understand correctly, the government's challenge to Watson's decision was weak.  In addition, as the CB article points out, Trump's tough guy defense of Muslim Ban 2 appears to have strengthened Hawaii's argument.

0,"Andrew Cohen uses the Cuban Missile Crisis to good effect to contrast the potential for growth of JFK with The Donald’s lack thereof.  We might also weigh the 1960s Democratic Party with the current GOP on that scale.  The 1960s Democrats had serious divisions & limitations of vision and capacity but they did have effective ways to compose their internal differences productively and develop effective ways to address real problems once the existence of those problems became inescapable. By contrast, Today’s GOP (with regard to its internal divisions and in its wilful disregard for the need to address inconvenient facts or events) is simply the Party of NO.  Even if Trump showed some unexpected maturity, grace and wisdom (i.e. learn from his setback), many factions within the GOP would simply wash their hands of him and of any responsibility to work to give coherence and realistic attention to US public policy needs.

DJT looked so uncomfortable as the debate concluded, it seemed like he couldn't wait to get out of there.  I am glad that the two did not shake hands at the start or the finish - it would only once again seem disingenuous with the bullying Trump slips into routinely with women who oppose him, especially in this horribly uncivil campaign of Mr. Trump.

""""...Trump has spent weeks saying he has a secret plan to destroy ISIS and now he says his plan is to get his generals to take thirty days to come up with a plan.

We either support the Constitution or we do not . There is no middle ground there. Then She said Mr. Trumps policies would hurt families, students, the economy, and our national security, while at the same time demonizing his efforts in protecting the border, or speaking out against Islamic extremism which has been a problem around the world for over 1400 hundred.

Yes abortion is a terrible thing but I believe that to support Donald Trump because of  his alleged ( Donald Trump is an opportunist) stance on abortion while ignoring all of  the other things he has said and done is a great injustice.  Further,  his values are not the values in the Gospels which we Christians are supposed to exemplify.

Secondly, the right wing fully expects and wants the left to fold, or just sit there singing Kumbaya, holding hands and meeting for focus groups to try and understand the roots of the right wing zeitgeist and angst. They are disappointed and shocked when left wingers actually stand up and present a physical resistance.

In that case, he's reckless and irresponsible -- which of course he is. In the meantime, every person and agency that has looked into his false accusation has concluded that Obama did not -- indeed could not -- do what Trump accuses (not 'accused', but accuses) him of doing. And so if the original accusation was born of stupidity, the continued repetition of the accusation is lying. (Or profound mental illness, which I cannot exclude.)  In any event, he's pedaling a falsehood.  A prestigious newspaper yesterday likened Trump to a drunk clinging to an empty bottle of gin.

Trump had thousands of employees--none of which publicly accused him of bias in the workplace. He has people of color in executive level positions in his company.  If you think campaigning against illegal immigration is racial hatred--you don't want to confront the truth. It is terrible that the vast majority of people who want to break our immigration laws are considered non-white--that doesn't change the fact that millions of people have broken the law and think there should no consequences to their behavior.

As the primaries wound down and the general election ramped up, and he began using the """"Crooked Hillary"""" moniker, I thought Clinton might be well-advised to tag him not so much to respond to him but to define him. I suggested """"Dirty Donald"""" because we already knew that he had lived a filthy life and that he was running a filthy campaign.  About the same time, Sen.Graham suggested """"Crazy Donald"""" -- equally appropriate.

Those who do walk in can simply tunnel or use ladders unless there are guards to stop them. But more importantly, American businesses, especially agriculture and services depend on these immigrants, legal or not, to pick crops and clean hotel rooms.  Jobs Americans don't want.

There's a number of flaws in the professor's OP- namely that, as you mentioned, he failed to offer any professorial solutions.  Instead, he casts stones at alleged class structures and the shoulder shrug of 'inherited wealth'.  First- just because someone is born into wealth doesn't mean the person is mandated to live a life of gluttony & excess (current prez excluded of course).  Second, upward mobility of the middle class has been bludgeoned courtesy of automation in the industrial workplace.  Some 70+% of jobs are gone- period.  Not to CHINA or Mexico ... but to robotics.  Third- our younger generations, after observing the cutthroat mindset of corporate USA during the past two decades and the recent depression, realize that there is limited long term commitment from most employers.  So, if the business isn't locally owned or self-employed, how do our younger folk take the risk?

Thank you very much, I'll take President Obama, retain my civil rights, live in a broad based economy and know that I have the right to protest what I don't like.  Trump is not admired or respected for his business acumen - do you get a prize for going bankrupt X number of times?    He's a salesman, smart in a manipulative way.  His loyal followers are just clamoring for his magic elixir.  Are you really Motleycrew or did you just steal his name?

As these groups gained sophistication they gradually came to make government their ally by taking advantage of the power that ordinary citizens can wield in a democracy.  In fact, a core """"progressive"""" belief is that only in a democracy can capitalists be held accountable to the people through the legislative reach of a strong government, courts and other public agencies.

0,"Reading the Canadian constitution, I note that electricity falls under exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial governments, as do non-renewable natural resources such as coal, oil, and gas. And yet Trudeau thinks he can impose a national carbon tax on the provinces whether they like it or not? I think he's smoking too much of that marajuana he's proposing to legalize.. They can use their constitutional powers to remove their electricity, coal, oil and gas from his taxation. The federal government cannot tax provincial governments.   He might have to send the Carbon Tax bill to each Canadian citizen himself, and you can imagine how well that is going to go over.  As for soon to be ex-VP Biden's claim that Trump cannot stop carbon limitations - yes Trump can. Obama got none of his measures approved by congress, so Trump can erase them with the stroke of a pen. And probably will. Without the $100 billion in subsidies Obama promised, a lot of other countries will take a pass as well.

And while Trump is a maverick, at least the White House will take their calls. Is that a situation that you want to disrupt with an impeachment? Maybe not.  Also, both the Republicans and Democrats have to be aware that Trump has tapped into a substantial under-current of dissatisfaction in the American people. And like it or not, Trump was elected on the strength of that dissatisfaction. Those who try to bring down Trump risk infuriating and alienating a large number of voters. To put it mildly, perhaps.

There needs to be major reform, both to bring International Corporatism into the service of the people instead of simply to their investors, and to government.

Lots of us are not included, and as Trump has little chance of stopping automation and cheap labor from wherever, I see little chance of real institutional improvement.

You might have noticed, these are lessons Donald Trump's election has yaught us. (lol).There's a big ugly divide between middle class and working class. The haves ignore have nots at their peril and the peril of our civilized make believe democracy.

To see a vivid example of Putin's style, watch this  fascinating  video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45zo3SEyuKY   Shows Putin at an event honoring  Borodino, the great Russian battle against Napoleon in 1812.  This is fine  up to a point, as all nations need pride and unity, but Putin is taking this much further, to a time of jackbooted militaristic nationalism  following one-man control.

To be fair, he has done one thing very well: made every previous President look even better (and Hillary too).

And it's said he did so after finding out President Obama hadn't authorized the raid.  When first presented with the plan, Trump wasn't interested.  But then he heard President Obama hadn't green lighted it.  Trump was all of a sudden very interested in pushing the raid through.  And the upshot now?  Now that Trump's first action he authorized went sideways, he wants to remove himself from the process so he has someone else to blame for any mistakes.  Trump, the man who shirks responsibility, who blames others, who runs from the responsibility of leadership.  He's a buffoon. A weak and insecure con man and a traitor.

0,"Think about it.  There are not that many restrictions on what initiatives can cover.  Of course with initiatives, the two main hindrances are the signatures required and you have more people voting on it than with a legislature, so more people to convince. It is also true that for something as generic as income taxes, there is no way that there is not going to be some sort of conflict of interest involved.   If you say that they can not vote to lower taxes on themselves, than you have hamstrung them on voting for taxes and you will only get increases in the tax rate. Trump does not have the power to pass any laws, he only has the power to approve laws.  He also does not have the power to submit any laws.  So yes, individual voters, in this state, have more power to pass laws than Trump does as President of the US.   And yes, you are right about the majority bit.

Natalia Veselnitskaya was a participant in the meeting that took place at Trump Towers with Kushner, Donald Trump Jr, and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.   As the Guardian notes Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon in the money laundering case and is also known as a lobbyist against the Magnitsky sanctions which featured as a subject discussed in that meeting.

So Limbaugh if you want to fix the illegal immigration problem maybe businesses should stop hiring them. No work, no pay, no reason to be here. The US also needs to quit interfering with the governments in other countries that destabilize them, thus making those countries dangerous to their own citizens and causing them to flee and risk everything to make it to the USA where they see a chance to be safe.

If an entire rebel held town had been wiped out, one might concede that government forces would do it to avoid street-to-street fighting, i.e. a military benefit that would save some of its soldier's lives.  That is not what happened.  A small number (in the overall context) of people were apparently killed by chemicals.  Use of CW to cause this small pocket of deaths provided negligible military advantage but did provide dramatic effect, a high probability dramatic effect, of opening direct conflict between the Syrian government and the US.  In the end, Assad cannot survive US involvement; therefore, out of his self interest, he would not use CW.  The rebels win big through their use.

0,"The Globe presents statistics entirely from when President Obama was in office and somehow then tries to link that to President Trump.  Really? And this is passing as journalism. How deliberately misleading. I love the part about putting forward it has something to do with race with NO statistics whatsoever to back it up.  Gee I wonder why people don't trust the press anymore. The Canadian government has been increasingly sharing information with US homeland security. These agreements have been coming online for several years and were negotiated under President Obama. If you reported on it, then Canadians could complain to the government responsible our own. It has nothing to do with Trump. And the border is under the executive branch of the US government. Americans, who have the most democratic county on the face of the planet, VOTED for and elected an executive that campaigned on tightening the border. SO????????? That's their prerogative.

Education is the worst - every new doctoral graduate has the latest theory on teaching based on nothing but their one graduate study.  The main conclusion about program outcomes is if government had done nothing, the problem the policy was to address would have resolved itself (as humans make decisions that are good for them) or it would have been no worse.  The swamp exists to expand and as a businessman, Trump knows that - you get results or you are out.

Just that he spoke out against the current status quo.  Honestly, for the 1st time in my life, I could not stomach voting for either candidate.

We already have a huge trade deficit with China, so seeking free trade with China hardly makes any sense. Like Trump's fair trade policy, we should be renegotiating with China those issues where the trade is unfair to Canada. Of course, as now seems apparent, contributing to the Trudeau Foundation is now the backdoor shekel  route for  China get  its way on free trade, while we will receive even more of their shoddy goods..

Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.

Trump has made it very clear that he has little interest in the well-being of the US or the values of our founders. His interest is in increasing the amount of his own power and adulation. Clinton, despite her copious faults, does at least pay some attention to what she considers the best interest of the nation. That's an order of magnitude better than Trump.  Trump's history of leveraging loopholes and telling lies to attain his objectives is very well established over decades. The worst that you can say about Clinton on that score is that she's no worse than him.

Thirdly, there is an average of 44 murders per day in the United States. Trump might want to first concentrate on tackling that issue before trying to scare people with imagined boogymen.

As for evidence associated with the Uranium discussion? I'm not certain any laws were broken, are you? My understanding is it was more an ethical breach where it would be a conflict of interest for a sitting SOS to negotiate directly or indirectly such a deal with a foreign power. Trump has been guilty of conflicts of interest every day since he assumed office.  While I welcome transparency, Clinton's ethical violations pale in comparison to election meddling as committed by Nixon + the possible collusion of the Trump campaign with the Russians.

Now the continued policies of colonialism that America forces on others while still stealing from the Natives, that resulted in every terrorist attack against America, is the root reason behind America refusing to join the International Criminal Court at the Hague. George Bush, Cheney, Clintons,Trumps and their families, made handsome profits off the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. They would, and should be brought up to face charges of crimes against humanity for the same kind of torture that we executed the German and Japanese prisoners after WW2.

Wild horse and burro euthanasia, including of excess healthy animals, has been a legal option to the BLM since 1978, and has been talked about in real terms since at least 2004.  In previous cases (particularly 2008, 2010 and 2016), the BLM purportedly included such a cull in their budgets, only to back off it due to public outcry.  A few dozen, nominally, are killed after each periodic roundup due to various reasons.  The BLM also has no legal restriction on selling horses for slaughter to turn into meat or products - since at least 2008, that practice has only been restricted due to directed defunding of USDA inspectors, which obviously limits both the ability to look at new product and animals leaving the border (both of which require USDA approvals).  Cry foul if you want...but this isn't a Trump thing, it's a long-running BLM thing.

The modus operandi of some Trump critics is to attack Trump, and sometimes his family, almost constantly and often unfairly, and if he ever responds to these attacks, then the critics intensify their attacks and claim they live under a dictatorship and other such similar utter nonsense.

0,"Trump's Budget Director has commented wondering if the Federal government should support research at all. In many people's view, if research is valuable then companies should do it and monetize their research. This is a clear example to the contrary (and I think there are many other great examples) of research performed by the World Health Organization.  Companies do not find 3rd world health problems a sufficient incentive (some do get federal funding to work in these areas). And yet, Ebola is a disease of sufficient virulence to be a possible national security threat. Government research acts when the capitalist market does not, for the betterment of all.

I can bet with our guy in Ottawa opening his yap he will eventually tick Trump off and we all will pay.  Never pick a fight you cannot win and in this case he will pick it for us and of course he will still be ok but we won't.

I am still learning about the recently exposed audio, in fact I just read a headline that quoted Trump saying something like""""grab her by the pu***""""?

Because as we all know, liberals are NOT massive duplicitous hypocrites. Right?

0,"You have that right. A lot of people focus on what Trump says, but it's about his followers. He would be nothing without his core, which is why he returns to rallies like a vampire needs a fix of blood. When one starts to understand how his supporters think, the rebuttals of Trump by the media and the Left seem self-serving. Many Trump supporters see no inconsistency in his statements or actions. If they do, they minimize them through various techniques. twy4Dolphin above uses an irrelevant comparison. How could a supporter think there was a danger from drugs being tossed over a wall? Simply note that while it's not common, it could happen, probably does happen since Trump mentioned it, and anyway, it's just a good idea. Simple. And why did Trump call for a transparent wall? Because he knows we can't afford the massive wall he once called for. That is why he has also said the wall will not be needed where there are geographical boundaries.  See, he's fiscally responsible.

"
0,"Stephan Paliwoda: I agree of course with the gist of your comments. But please note that Donald Trump is NOT president """"because of the unequal distribution of electoral votes among the states"""" but rather because almost all states have chosen -- for partisan advantage -- to give ALL their electoral votes to the popular vote winner in their own state.  One could take this as indicating that the NATIONAL popular vote should instead be used, but an alternative is to recognize that this practice unconstitutionally deprives minority voters in each state of equal protection (i.e., equal treatment of their votes), an issue that was highlighted by the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore (2000).  A solution would be for all states to agree to assign their electoral votes proportionally to the popular vote in their own state. If this were done -- even with the small-state advantage built into the Electoral College -- Trump would still have lost (given the campaigns and votes as they were).

The truth is, there are no consequences for him. He won, and he did so by blatantly appealing to all sorts of bigotry because the people who voted for him didn't seem to mind that one bit. In fact, many Trump supporters voted for him precisely because he did play to their racist, sexist, nativist, xenophobic instincts.  What the rest of us who didn't vote for Trump have to acknowledge is that the country we inhabit is a much darker, fearful, angry, divided place than we ever thought. Now we know.

It's the arrogance of bureaucratic leadership to believe that they can manage the personalities, goals, skills of any organization just because they have led other groups.   Nobody suggest that Bill Belicheck takes over the reins of the Yankees.  Trump success as promotor/salesmen for high priced real estate for the very wealthy, does not mean his skills are transferable to non-profit public service spanning all income groups.

Perhaps the master mind trump should have an above board conversation with Putin since he's allegedly so good at this sort of thing.

There are far too many variables at work here to even begin to be mathematical.  I think, too, that the author is largely ignoring the checks and balances inherent in the American political system.  Trump may be an authoritarian narcissist who believes many of his own falsehoods, but the Constitution would be a major stumbling block for many of the Cassandra like predictions in the article.  We've seen already that it is no major feat to thwart his more ill-advised schemes like the immigration ban.  I worry about Trump's potential effects on the environment, and worry too that the man controlling the marionette's strings has been pretty clear in saying he thinks war would be a good thing.  But I know Trump's support, even from his own party, is dwindling.  I think that cautious optimism is more sensible than terror at this point.

0,"It’s easy to get caught up in the deeply flawed character of Donald Trump. We also need to recognize the policy catastrophe of this presidency.  This past week Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era executive action that shielded around 800,000 young undocumented immigrants – often called Dreamers – from deportation under what’s been known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.  Look at other of Trump’s recent policy decisions and you see the same arbitrary and unnecessary cruelty. What’s the point of banning transgender people from military service? Of siding in court with a businessman who doesn’t want to sell his services to gay couples? Of weakening the standard for responding to sexual violence in universities? Of banning Syrian refugees and reducing by half the number of refugees admitted to the United States?  There is no point, in terms of policy. None of these decisions makes America safer or economically stronger or fairer.

Then it gets to the larger issues of constitutionality.  However, there are some serious constitutional issues.

The intent can also be derived from the effect and the effect is against the """"majority"""" religion, ie. violates the Establishment clause for treating """"majority"""" and """"minority"""" religions differently.

0,"I don't think Americans have much of a choice during this election, but we all need to make the best choice from two bad candidates. From a father of a military soldier, do I want to listen to the media who doesn't always gather the facts before posting?  Or do you stick with facts that could destroy America?  Hillary committed a breach of TOP Military secrets by compromising all American's safety and freedom.  While TRUMP is suddenly being accused by women coming out years later making accusations.  Might I add that is all it is: accusations blown up by the media and Democrats.  Bill Clinton too should be in jail for adultery, when #1 in command.  How can anyone trust the Clintons?  I'm sure if Hillary won, Bill would still be preying on women in the White House like he did in the past.  So really, is Trump's outspoken demeanor worse off than The Clinton's Criminal Acts?  She breached confidentiality once, so who's to say it won't happen again.  My vote is still: Trump!!!

That's why Ford specifically wrote the pardon to cover any future crimes that may come to light, unprecedented in American history.  There is no moral equivalency in Nixon's crimes and Clinton saying he didn't have """"sexual intercourse"""" with Monica Lewinski.  Maybe Clinton really believed oral sex is not intercourse.  Clinton never was convicted in the Senate and never was pardoned.  Nixon admitted his guilt when he accepted the pardon. The CIA's file on Lee Harvey Oswald is set to be made public at the end of this month providing our Commander-in-Chief (or as our Secretary of State calls him """"moron-in-chief"""") signs-off.

Most of us Trump supporters do not believe """"Joan Rivers was killed for outing Obama as gay and Michelle as a transgender man"""" -like stories.

It does not follow, however, that Canada and Mexico should allow themselves to be bullied into unfair concessions by the US.  Besides the direct and unwarranted pain this would cause Canadians and Mexicans, such surrender would only encourage the US to demand further unfair concessions at a later date.  That said, matching Trump's bravado mindlessly with our own would be foolish and needlessly dangerous.  It may be necessary at some critical stage for Canada and Mexico to threaten to suspend negotiations (and to do so if the US is truly overbearing) but the best course is the middle one of resolute, hard but fact-based and reasonable bargaining on our part in the expectation that many elements in the US will support reasonable outcomes and reject needless rejection of NAFTA and the WTO.

They're the party of critics but as we've seen when it comes to actually performing anything they fall flat on their face (of course it isn't their problem).  Obama's appointment was towards the center in hopes of bringing people together and not playing partisan politics. It's right for Merkley to stand up and protest the Republicans stealing this nomination - simply out of principle.  The Democrats attempted to govern for 8 years under Obama and the Republicans failed to compromise and work together which is what the American people elected them to do. Instead we were met with stonewalling tactics and government shutdowns.  If Trump wanted to be a leader that brought people together he could have chose Garland, or someone more to the center who Democrats could get behind, but he didn't.

Dealing with the American government for the next four years is going to require a whole different skill set from traditional diplomacy.  It will be essential to not rely on the Americans to do anything that they say they will, because Trump has the ultimate deciding power and demonstrably disavows any of his surrogates when the mood is upon him.

He is for tax cutting taxes which is Republican, infrastructure spending which is more Democrat  ( Trudeau is proposing the same thing) and anti free trade like Bernie Sanders ( and the Canadian labour movement).  His style of government seems more like business negations instead  of the more traditional politics. Which causes a lot of confusion as he seems to be more concerned in getting things done  instead of paying the traditional games.  Unfortunately for him the extreme right feel he is their candidate , which is questionable as his son in law is Jewish and American are anti sematic. He is also very thinned skinned which is not a good thing for a powerful politician.

Not 100% Which is  probably why Jesus also said a Christian has to love even our enemies.  Trump's words have at times been un-Christian and at other times he will need to actually have to order to kill our enemies, just like Obama did and every other President before has.  The Bible says that the governing authorities are  God's sword to keep order and punish wrongdoing.

For me, the entrenched repub. leadership, who are afraid of Trump, since it is breaking their own corruption, is another reason to want him to win. Politics as usual is no longer an option for me, and for many many of our citizens.

JFK’s justification for taking us to the brink of nuclear disaster was sphere of interest. Russian missiles so close to our shores was and still is unacceptable. By the same token, threatened US/allied nuclear strikes so close to China and Russia and possible occupation of NK is unacceptable to China and Russia. For better or worse, NK serves as a buffer to two competing ideologies. The tsunami of Chinese troops crossing the border into NK during the Korean War serves as a reminder that spheres of interest are powder kegs. The underlying issue of international conflict is overwhelmingly economics. Hopefully, Trump’s business sense is the key to a new kind of in-your-face diplomacy based on trade instead of weapons. If so, then he may be the answer.

0,"There's been reports the media have published of intercepted surveillance of Trump's team. (Narrative is usually Trump and Russian/ Putin ties.) It seems reasonable to look into whether this process was abused. German Chancellor Angela Merkel very publicly accused The U.S. of spying on her (intercepting her cellphone communications) and Obama's response was essentially that all countries have surveillance programs and do things like this. WikiLeaks released documents showing The U.S. spied not only on Angela Merkel, but also the leaders of France and Britain. It's not unreasonable to assume they would have also wanted to do this on Trump and his team. I don't see the problem with investigating whether this process was abused. Maybe it will show that not only did Trump and his team say and do some inappropriate things, but also that Obama and Clinton and The Democratic Party also did. Why not have an investigation? If there's nothing to hide, why hide it?

But in fact these officials have made unsupported accusations, delayed meeting with Congress and then showed up unprepared to give answers, changed meeting dates with the President-Elected and blamed him, and leaked secrets to media even before they were provided to him.  All this in the context of fallaciously questioning the merits of his election victory.  Many heads should roll come Jan 21.

I've heard several assert that Trump is a devout Christian, that he's a self-made millionaire, that he's a genius who will """"fix"""" everything.  I've even heard he's for universal health care.  The remainder, and unfortunately the majority, have to do with pejorative racist ideas of getting Obama out of the White House (even though he's leaving anyway).

Those of us that are not white or Christian watched them for over a year and know if we some how just disappeared, they would be very happy. They made it very clear that they will use the 2nd Amendment on us. I would not be surprised if Trump pardons Dylan Roof just to insult us, since he knows virtually none of us voted for him. He is petty that way. His voters won't mind at all. Trump does not care enough to be a full blown racist. That takes work and focus. However, his minions are another matter.

The difference is that there were Republicans of integrity back then who knew that their nation and its Constitution mattered more than their party's Richard Nixon, and were ready to remove him from the White House. In today's hopelessly partisan politics, Trump will catch every break from his gutless Republican toadies, their only concern being personal power and profit. No doubt he will be comforted by his moronic fans, mesmerized by his brash dictatorial style, ever grateful that he saves them the work of thinking for themselves.

I believe that a sense of losing white privilege, a pent up anger at BHO, and, in the case of Catholics and Evangelicals, the abortion issue + economic distress (real or imagined) combined to permit him to squeak out the victory. But do not overlook the fact that many, many members of our faith are very racist! The comments that I heard last year about Hispanics & blacks were terrible.

0,"This entire episode is moving along a time line and what was true a day ago may not be true a day later.   Comey is not a soothsayer; therefore, even he wanted, he could not have implied that his statement to the President regarding his (Trump's) status as not being an object of any investigation would be true at all time in the future.   Comey's statement should never have been used as evidence of total exoneration.  Also remember as with Nixon (who resigned) and Clinton (who was impeached) neither would have had serious  problems with the original circumstances.  What tripped them both was the credible appearance of obstruction of justice which seems to be the bane of the egotistical.  Lastly, impeachment is a political process much more than a judicial process and absent that political will to impeach,  it will not happen.

One is global fascism, the other is progressivism for the good of people and the planet.  We see the harm right wing fascism as exemplified by the Nixons, Bushes, and Trumps is doing. If unions and environmental groups had more power and money they could not do the harm being done by multinational corporations destroying democracy for profits, eroding national sovereignty, making wars, harming the environment, and neglecting the needs of 6 billion struggling people for profits. The point is, influence in Western elections by fascist states like Russia destroys democracy. You don't hear of Denmark or Norway trying to influence our elections. But elections are merely going through the motions of democracy when corporate oligarchs make the rules. Unions and Greenpeace merely try to redress the gross imbalance of power.

Calling it that makes me suspicious of the sincerity and the intentions of those who make this claim.  I'm also troubled when one has a hard ideology about raising or cutting taxes, as I belief each situation needs to be addressed individually to find what is best. I don't think one can say all options need to be considered and then in the next sentence remove an the option of raising taxes.  My fear is that to leave social security to the swings of the stock market makes it too vulnerable; that it removes the """"security"""" from """"social security.

Those of us who know history and follow geopolitics understand the danger to our socioeconomic fabric that accompanies the likes of Trump in power.

When investment partnerships sell off an asset that they helped or caused to grow in value ...they are taking profits ...long term profits and those profits are taxed accordingly like they should be. I believe under Trumps plan the rate increased about 5% SD and the total benefit is more like 1-2 billion a year for everyone eligible to have the profits on th sale of an asset taxed this way ...not 3 billion a yr for 20 hedge fund mgrs

0,"I have said it before. Trump should have followed the form of Obama's immigration vetting order and eliminated all of this trouble for himself. He could have made some changes to toughen it up and he would have been fine. Obama's order worked better because he did not focus on 6 or 7 countries, but on people who could be terrorists. Terrorists can come from Canada, London, or Lebanon-- so you need to focus on where they have been (to terrorist training camps with Al Quaeda, Taliban, or ISIS? for example), attend a mosque in Canada or London where there is a militant group that the person being vetted joined.

Saudi Arabia pointing the finger at Qatar is quite rich.  Iran has a point when they ask which country has been the source of the most Islamic terrorists around the world.

0,"About Donald Trump, Meryl Streep said  “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence invites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.”  That would be fine, but earlier in her speech, she said (earning laughs):  """"So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick them all out you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.""""  Apparently Meryl Streep, a powerful public figure on a public platform, can mock and malign a group of people with no apparent sense of irony.  I certainly won't defend Donald Trump and his mocking of others, but then why would I support or defend Ms. Streep's own hypocrisy in mocking others.

It seemed like the logical thing to do since the Russians have claimed that the chemicals that caused the tragedy came from rebel stockpiles of chemical weapons that were hit by Syrian warplanes, presumably inadvertentenly.( See “Syrian gas incident caused by rebels' own chemical weapons: Russian Defense Ministry Syrian gas incident caused by rebels' own chemical weapons: Russian Defense Ministry”, April 6, New China.) There was not nearly sufficient time to investigate this claim, one way or another. Today Trudeau totally backs Trump in his unilateral act of aggression against Syria, with no conclusive evidence that it is justified. After goading Trump with imbecilic tweets when the first so-called Muslim ban was announced in January, Trudeau is now Trump’s gutless lackey.

Far from flouting the law as Mr. Saunders claims, Donald Trump acted fully within his lawful powers in firing James Comey. Trump's action doesn't put America's justice system at risk; Trump's risk is all political. And that's the point: the Government of Canada should remain neutral on the internal political affairs of our allies.  Barrack Obama, and George W. Bush before him, acted on secret legal opinions written for them by their own White House attorneys. And they didn't just fire some Washington bureaucrat, but tortured and killed people- including Americans and innocent civilians- in distant lands. Mr. Saunder's outrage over Trump's latest move isn't born out of fact, it's personal.

Trump might get a short-term bump in support by engaging in military adventurism but eventually this would be more than offset by public revulsion at the loss of American lives and tax revenues. Thus, I suspect Trump, if he's inclined towards militarism to show that he can flex his muscles, will seek out measured surgical strikes (as he's already demonstrated in Syria) or easy and inexpensive skirmishes, like Reagan's invasion of Grenada. And in case you haven't noticed he's already figured out his preferred response to Europe's refugee crisis - close the doors.

Either way the debt will have to increase, no doubt about it. At least with trump it will work towards the long run of lowering it by cutting several areas of the economy, social assistance being a big one. Infrastructure spending adds to debt in the short term but will be a long term gain if managed correctly which it certainly wasn't under obama and wouldn't have been under Clinton. Government would have just expanded exponentially which is good for no one, besides government. There will certainly be several pains when it comes to a 20 trillion dollar debt. You have to hold on and brace the storm. Obama showed what lawyers do to the economic state of a country, and Clinton was just that, a lawyer. No different then obama.

The"""" coles notes"""" on raising minimum wage to $15.00 is that it means less jobs and higher prices for everyone including those working for the minimum wage. Businesses that typically employ minimum wage have a very large percentage of their overhead associated with labour costs. They either have to cut costs (positions) or raise prices. Stats of interest....3.9% of US workers make minimum wage or less. Of this 3.9%, 50% are students. Raising minimum wage affects such a tiny portion of the population and works to reduce opportunities for students to work part time to make some money while going to school.

Talk radio hosts have been spouting misogyny and anti-immigrant hysteria for years; Trump is their ideal leader, not merely a flawed vehicle for their views. Fox News has been dabbling in conspiracy theories (e.g. birtherism, climate-change denial) for decades; now Republicans practice intellectual nihilism. Nearly every point of criticism raised against the left — softness on foreign aggressors, irresponsible budgeting, identity politics, executive overreach, contempt for the rule of law, infantilizing voters — has become a defining feature of the right.

0,"This election simply showed that she could not even beat Trump. He was promoted by billions of dollars in free advertising. The MSM saw to it to push this guy to bump up their ratings (revenues) and simultaneously assist Sec. Clinton with the one beatable GOP candidate.

0,"The DNC is fractured - the """"establishment"""" power elites vs. voters - just like the RNC. Such division and anxiety would not be happening now if we hadn't had such a President that promoted hate, racism, etc. and has allowed the ubber rich to succeed over the common folk. That's not opinion - just search who has profited during the Obama years.  I'm not voting Republican. I'm not voting Democrat. I'm voting Trump.

0,"Well, you'll certainly understand the conclusion I arrived at, namely that you, like icee, were hard core anti Trumpers.

1,"I cannot believe the level of extreme vitriol, bogus claims and bootless insults that are considered to somehow be """"Civil Comment"""" here so long as they are comments emanating from the far left and directed at current and recent bogymen among conservatives, e.g. Trump, Bush #43 and Harper.  In this instance, the poster claims Phillips, Yale and Harvard grad Bush #43 with a verified IQ in the superior range slightly higher than the left's 2004 genius John Kerry is deeply ignorant, way over his head, led astray, etc.  What this hate filled and uncivil poster calls Trump including amateur character analysis is too disgusting to even regurgitate here.  The piece d'resistance is what he calls our closest neighbour, ally, trading partner and friend.   The USA - says this lefty - is the most dangerous state in the world.  This left wing lunatic fringer gets published while others including me get rejected with even one unkind albeit true comment about Trudeau 2.0.  Disgusting.

1,"Goldberg's at it again.  Oh yes, I'm sure not only Clinton and Johnson, but Washington, Abraham Lincoln and other past presidents swore like drunken sailors on shore leave just like Scaramucci does. Just like him.

And of course """"young"""" 71 year-old-old Trump is just a product of modern culture. Except when it comes to his trophy wife, sexism, misogyny, business practices and, oh, everything else. In that way he's exactly like an old, racist white guy who thinks he's better than everyone else.

0,"Trump gave his usual and repeated ad nauseam speech he gave at the debates, at the election, and every day since then.  He showed no class, no continuity between administrations (ANY of them), sounds like a dock worker (which is fine if you are, in fact, a dock worker) and said nothing to even remotely serve to lift the country up, and certainly not to start any of that healing we hear about so often.  He does not have the qualities needed in him, and never has.  This president will be a source of embarrassment at every level, if not dangerous in some, but I pray that he achieves some things absolutely necessary for our country - and finds positive ways of paying for them rather then the current GOP plans to attack the social networks that holds us in some degree of caring existence.  Problem is, Trump doesn't know what he is doing, or even what it takes to maintain and improve our nation, and as a result we will all suffer.  At he same time, perhaps we need to go through that, too.

0,"Whether you like Trump or not this is surely bizarre behaviour. Sending your press secretary to rush out and harangue the media about the size of the crowd at your inauguration is scarcely the way a president should act.

I take responsibility for what I write, to whom I offend or all the things that come from expressing my opinions and thought honestly....and in plain sights. If you live a fearful existence, maybe you shouldn't write. Although I agreed with what you have written, at least Mr. Keogh is expressing his views openly and under his own name (I hope at least) while you hide and snipe. Electoral College give a voice to people living in all part of the nation. Popular votes only favors people in big cities along the coasts. Geographically, Trump won, without the Electoral College, our nation would be hemmed by geographical apartheid. Food for thought!
"
0,"First off, if your only complaint is how the leader acts on one issue then there's obviously not much else to complain about.  Second, when dealing with an intelligent and rational leader such as Obama, a similar approach would be very effective.  When dealing with a benighted, belligerent, bombastic cry-baby like Donald Trump, a good dose of his own medicine is fully warranted.  So I am glad we have a former drama teacher to deal with this drama queen, even if the presentation lacks a little eloquence, it's effective.
"
0,"We may have to be prepared to tolerate a period of high unemployment and low economic growth.  It would be better to meet Trump head-on rather than follow a policy of appeasement.  Appeasement doesn't work with bullies. If he wants to scrap NAFTA, then so be it. Sue his socks off and wait till he gets turfed out or impeached. Then negotiate with a grown-up.  In the meantime we can just do what we can, but it will cost us. How much are we prepared to sacrifice for our economic sovereignty and national dignity.  I have a lot of confidence in our current government, and I'm sure glad to have Trudeau and the new Liberal cabinet instead of the ExPM and his trained seals.

If false, it's treasonous.  Re: the FBI's actions: Who had control over the FBI? Trump and his party, or Hillary and her party? What the FBI did was not Trump's doing, nor was their investigation of Hillary in the first place.  How about the Russians? Any evidence Trump was complicit in their activities? None. Zero. Lots of speculation, though. Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation is closing Clinton Global Initiative due to a precipitous downturn in foreign donations since Hillary lost the election. Pretty easy to speculate why, if speculation counts.  """"And talking frankly (actually, just making up stuff) about how Trump gained power...may also help to limit that power."""" Ah.

You judge as important how Trump got his toys and his super model and find his lies, cheats, thefts, hypocrisy and incompetence appalling.  mustbekidding admires the surface appearance presented by a con artist while ignoring the substance, or in Trumps' case lack thereof, beneath the surface. In America we used to have a general agreement on goals and outcomes, just disagreements on how to achieve them.  Each """"side"""" treated the other as a Honorable Opposition and each side brought informed opinion and empathy to the table.  Today we have mustbekidding apparently admiring a man for doing things that his mother should have slapped his face for (both Trumps' and mustbekiddings' mothers).  Trumps ability to be..., well Trump, is the goal to mustbekidding and that's a very sad thing.  It also means the destruction of America and must be stopped.

After a pompous introduction, Trump, surrounded by sycophants, sat at the """"tiny desk"""" that he has previously ridiculed and signed a meaningless piece of paper as if it were an important bill passed by Congress (it wasn't). He resembles nothing more than a child on a merry-go-round who thinks he is actually riding a horse. After a very bad weekend and before the looming very bad Thursday (when Comey testifies) the White House is busy creating these little play scenarios in an effort to convince the public (and Trump, himself) that he is capable of acting like a President.
"
1,"Trump doesn't care about facts or research, or about people in general.  He is only interested in keeping on the good side of his deplorable base.   If these Republicans gave a damn about keeping children safe, they would be putting policies and sanctions in place to protect children involved  in sports activities and religious groups.  That's where the predators lure their prey, not in the bathroom.   The Republicans created this issue out of nothing at all, just to introduce """"religion"""" into politics. It's revolting and Trump simply doesn't give a tinker's damn about Jackie's appeal or equality.

That column does get a lot of comments, but the NYTimes won't publish a comment such as you describe. NYTimes standards are higher. However, people disagree if they have the wit to write a polite and convincing rebuttal. Krugman also wrote in his blog that Hollande wasn't suited to be president, so Krugman wasn't a supporter.

Do not vote for Mr. Trump because of (fill in favorite demonizing epithet to describe your feelings towards him) I agree with Mr. Gerson on at least one thing: both candidates are monsters.  But one of them unarguably will be inaugurated as President on 20 January 2017. If monsters cannot be destroyed, they must be leashed and contained. Consider the constraints that will be placed on Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump whichever one wins the election. Secretary Clinton will have a fawning media, a compliant political establishment and a court packed by her who have no regard for the Constitution. Mr. Trump will be tracked incessantly by a hostile media, has no relations with anyone in the political establishment and, based on the list of judges he provided several months ago, will appoint judges and justices with a strong allegiance to the Constitution. He will have the biggest leash.

Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon.

Pence has been in politics for years, and would probably be somewhat more effective.  Pence is also a religious zealot, couple that with him understanding our political system, and we have someone who could lay the groundwork for many laws that some would see as a Christian version of Sharia Law.

If my pure so confidant in her, don't ou believe she could have won by playing by the rules?  She has had hundreds, even thousands of opportunities to turn her sinking ship around and she has refused every time.  We have asked continually for fairness and to be acknowledged and heard, and even after four days of having to sit through her pompous, self-promotion bullshit (that a what the convention is, if you didn't know), she still chose to safe face instead of operating with integrity and honesty.

Free speech, being a constitutional civil right under the first amendment, is currently under threat from violent leftist goons who have attempted to intimidate speakers and assaulted attendees. Wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if Trump followed a democrat president's example by sending in a similar detachment to prevent violence and enable Coulter to exercise her civil right to free speech? That this could occur in the cradle of the 1960's free speech movement, which has since been assimilated to the Dark Side, would be doubly ironic.

Without any paperwork trail, these veterans were denied VA services; some ended up committing suicide. In regards to Syria, politically it would not make sense for Assad to gas his own people and cause international/USA retaliation especially when his position is more secure now with the help of the Russians. The Trump administration and the media have not provided any empirical evidence regarding the sarin attack other than photos/video. MIT professor Theodore A.

Therefore, Donald's campaign is doing the very same thing.

You and I, by virtue of our posts on this forum, are included in that very large army.  The crucial point to grasp is that the paid operatives for both campaigns are swamped numerically by the incredibly large number of VOTERS/supporters/fans/activists pushing the message of one camp or the other on their own time, on their own dime. Therefore, it is absurd to belief that either camp could possibly CONTROL or DOMINATE social media.  If you don't understand that, then you don't understand the internet, period!  (continued)

The evidence* is that providing transgender surgery and hormones would cost the US military between $2.4 million and $8.4 million per year, in addition to the time lost. That's to cover the estimated 29-129 service members who would seek the treatment yearly. It's rational to ask, is that additional cost worth the small number of soldiers gained from it? While that matter is being studied it's reasonable to put a hold on transgender people joining the US military. And that's what Trump did.  It's also reasonable to assume that, as did 18 other countries including Canada, the US military will conclude that allowing transgendered people to serve does not seriously impact the force's ability to function.  * The Implications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly in the U.S. Military - Rand Corporation  https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9909.html

Should nobody of character or competence be willing to serve and to give back to the country so long as Trump is president?  This would condemn the US and its people to four or even eight years of gridlock, drift and decline and would not only harm America but also the western liberal democractic system because the US remains the leader and the chief financier of that system.

Obama was able to motivate progressives and minorities to vote for him in record numbers, but his influence did not extend to mid-terms. Clinton was unable to marshal that same level of excitement.

But, like you said, keep hope alive.

After all, unions benefit their class of people and not wealthy CEO's and shareholders. Clearly, the answer is Fox News and their slavish devotion to it. But I'd still like to hear them answer that question for themselves just to hear what BS comes pouring out of their mouths.

He reminds me of Dr. Strangelove, played by George Scott, in the movie about cold war fears on nuclear conflict. You know, where George is astride a nuclear bomb flying out of the bomb door, waving and yahooing like a cowboy. -- Trumps ultimate ambition? Would he do it? I wouldn't bet against it.

As Saunders has pointed out, the median income of a Trump voter was $72,000. This is not a person who was hurting financially. In both Brexit and in the case of the US, there is a clear and important racial component at work. The Tea Party supporters were also quite wealthy, but their major problem was they could not stand having an African American President. Remember that 90% of the people who voted for Trump were white. There were plenty of non-white people who suffered from the housing crisis and its aftermath. They did not vote for Trump. Many of them did not vote at all. This underlines the extent to which this vote had race at its heart. We ignore this at our peril.

He's already backed off abolishing it in the US. The greatest element in rising health care costs in this country (and in the US) is drug costs. If we had a national drug program where drugs are bought centrally by one government entity we would probably save enough money to pay for increased services in other areas. Despite some posters accusing those who favor higher taxes for better health care as being in favor because they dont pay taxes (correction; the bottom 50% do pay taxes).. we all pay for drug costs either directly or in tax deductions/drug plans. Bring in a central purchaser and watch your drug prices (for which we pay the 2nd highest prices after the US) drop.

The court bans did nothing that prevented the government from implementing them. Nothing. So obviously that was not the reason for the attempted temporary bans.

Due to the previous President's inability to get Congress to act he created this program out of thin air.  But, the program has these 800,000 young people in a sort of quasi legal limbo that President Trump now wants to clean up. The only way he can force the hand of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, is to declare the program to end in 6 months.  This way both parties are responsible if there is no legislation passed to help them. No one wants the blame for not creating a clear path to citizenship for these mostly contributory young folks that by no fault of theirs were brought here. The far majority of these young people are over the age of 18. Once becoming U.S. Citizens they can visit any out of country family and return without a problem.

If Comey's conversations had covered classified material in any way, Trump would have attempted to use executive privilege to prevent him from testifying. He did not.

Which could lead to a charge of interfering with an ongoing Federal Investigation. Why did he have the Memo included in the letter on Comey's firing? In fact, the whole point of the memo was to provide the rationale in order not to have to face a possible charge of interfering with the investigation that could affect him-- and could eventually lead to impeachment. Unfortunately the memo which vindicates Hillary is simply not what Trump would have acted on-- he would have no part of that memo given his praise of Comey during the campaign.

0,"Go to esurance.com, and see what the rate is for health insurance in AK and in Seattle. It'll show you why the previous owners moved out of state. $900 difference.  Before Obamacare my insurance as a self-employed person was very close to the same whether I lived in Alaska or Seattle. Sure, the republicans messed it up with Alaska not participating, but Obama messed it all up. Insurance was high, but not as high as now, regardless of the state you live. Yes, it's great the uninsured is now insured, but we are pay way more than we should to cover the uninsured. What Obamacare has done is put even more money in pockets of insurance companies, large hospitals and doctors. If we continue those rates will continue to grow and no one will be able to afford it but will be taxed when they can't. The sad part is the tax is less expensive than getting insurance. Ridiculous. I hope Trump can fix this, but I'm not too sure there either.

I don't know where John Blaine fits in as being 'good buddies' with Trump. If he is a Republican in the image of a  """"John McCain type"""" of Republican, I'd say it's more than likely he's a Democrat. A liberal, even... . Gee, a Liberal who runs  a voting system company linked to another  that's owned by an extremely left-wing dictatorship run by Nicholas Maduro. There wouldn't be any fraud there, right?  I think this is the 'smoking gun' in the alleged voter fraud in California.  It is our duty to investigate this mess. . Thank you for the mistake Lynn, I think you may have stumbled on to something here...Some very good  things have come from a  'mistake', like  Penicillin, which was discovered by accident...

From the previous comments, the Trump supporters haven't noticed that this opinion would be as anti-Trump as it is anti-Clinton.  Please, if you want to support a candidate, actually research what that candidate plans to do.  I guess even nationally syndicated authors fail in this regard.

Even if it were proved tomorrow that Russia did not interfere in the election in any way, Sessions would still be guilty of lying.  It's the Trump administration, not the press, that can't get their facts straight. Describing the meeting between Sessions and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, a Justice Department official said, “There’s just not strong recollection of what was said.” Then a White House official told CNBC that there was “superficial” discussion of the election. Finally, Sessions said that he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.”  So there are 3 Trump administration stories: 1) they met, but no one remembers what they talked about, or 2) they met, and they do remember talking about the campaign but only briefly. 3) they never met It's like a child's choose-your-own-adventure book.

0,"Mr. Sylte: The Obama """"era"""" deportations involved undocumented immigrants arrested for crimes other than not having documentation of citizenship.  Indeed, about 2.5 million such individuals were deported. ....and you're right, those of us """"on the left"""" did NOT criticize that action.  Were President Trump continuing that very sensible policy, I guarantee you, I wouldn't complain.  The Trump policy is an agressive """"round up"""" of individuals who are undocumented....regardless of whether they have committed a crime (other than the """"crime"""" of lacking documentation) or not.  This includes individuals who may have been in the U.S. for many years, paid taxes, and possibly are contributing more to the welfare of our country than those individuals screaming for their deportation.

He is calling us to an adult understanding and expression of our faith; his critics, generally, prefer to infantilize that portion of the People of God who are not clerics. It's worth noting, too, that Weigel's neo-conservative politics trumped his much vaunted loyalty and devotion to Pope John Paul II.  When Pope John Paul, in what as arguably the most courageous act of his pontificate, stood against the gathering storm of an illegal and immoral war in Iraq, Weigel treated the pope with the worst form of contempt: condescension: The pope didn't know what he was talking about, but he couldn't help it: he was too old, too Polish, not well-served by his advisors.

0,"This string just confirms what the realist knows, people will avoid the truth of 'tomorrow' if it gets in the way of the immediate gratification for wealth and consumption.  History is replete with human arrogance and self centered greed. Conservatives know this, Trump knows this.   He knows the world has people with evil intentions, he has every intention of using power, not ethics or morality, to get what's he wants.  So you should not be surprised, the President knows this, powerful/super wealthy people will lie to the public about environmental risk if it hurts their 'winning'.  You must know this because it true of Democrats as well, they might just have a different definition of 'winning'.  Self centered behavior is normal and good for self-preservation.  It turns to greed for some ( at all income levels).

0,"I am still waiting on Trump to apologize to President Obama for the birther nonsense. If Trump was serious about being a unifier and not a divider, and if he was serious about being a president for all Americans (which I highly doubt based on how many unbelievably awful things he said during the campaign), he can start by accepting the legitimacy of the man, the person who currently holds the office that he will be in starting January 20, 2017. Otherwise, Trump will again prove why he is unfit to be President, why he lacks the temperament and decency to truly be a President for all Americans.

His words and his actions have run the gamut from childishness to self aggrandizing to bragging about sexual assault to outright lies designed to divert our attention from the real issues. A self promoting, profanity laced speech to the Boy Scouts... really?  Here he is with a rhetoric that is as divisive as it is clueless.  With all of the issues, from N. Korea to hurricane driven disasters and the budget and healthcare, Trump decides its the right time to focus on peaceful protests by NFL players.  Trump sees it as disrespecting the flag and apparently never stopped to consider that it might not be about disrespecting the flag or the anthem to these players.  The ability to see things from the point of view of others would be an important quality in any leader and so we can add empathy as another gap in the embarrassing character of this one.

How much of Assad's effort went against ISIS versus the rebels is still uncertain.  But Trump had undermined the efforts of the rebel coalition and the Obama administration and the world stood by as Assad virtually wiped them out.

0,"Just within the last 30 days Trump has cut/harmed various agreements or programs and kicked them to Congress to fix. In each of these cases he's been either an antagonist or, at best, hands off supporting rather than taking a more proactive part.  The most glaring is perhaps ending the DACA program.  He claims he as them """"in his heart"""" and """"they'll be fine"""" but then treats them like a political bargaining chip for tougher immigration reforms.  Perhaps the best example is with this part of the ACA (not the other EOs such as the one which creates a loophole for insurance companies to """"band"""" healthy/lower risk accounts) which he supported, then backed off on.  But the worst has got to be de-certifying the Iran deal when Iran is holding up their end of the deal.  He passed the buck to Congress in a deliberate play to his political base.

Atop the motive, I have a hard time believing that Comey was so intimidated by Donald Trump he sat in the Oval Office gobsmacked and was too petrified to follow up in any way aside from writing a memo to himself.  In short, his account of the meeting doesn't mesh.  But I suppose it's possible it happened as Comey said - for the reasons PhilCO3 put out - and in my view, if that was the case, Comey would have been incompetent.

0,"Has Fr. Reese asked himself (and answered) the wrong question? Is there not a real possibility that """"the Trump election"""" virtually undercut (and I mean """"under"""") the distinction between Rep. and Dem. to evoke what is basely common to both? Of course there are the campaign shortcomings and coups, there is the """"rust belt"""", the """"rural urban divide"""". It is human to be afraid of change, and the response ranges from reasoning it out and engaging adjustment over to adamant, angry, vitriolic rejection. There is a bit of racist, homophobe, and misogyny in so many of us. Who is entirely pure? But we reason, think, listen, purge, grow and act with equality, inclusion, of course.  But....there are other """"works in progress"""" who are fragile, other silently """"not""""; others are so entrenched that they are silent in public but in the privacy of anon. write vitriolic tweets, wear """"hoods"""", some ready and willing to act. When it's ok to be racist, misogynistic, homophobic the healing stops, hate is victor.
"
0,"Yes - it is what I meant in my last sentence, that perhaps we need to go through this.  My thinking is that before those who support President Trump can see how fundamentally wrong they were, and experience the suffering that will come to them and/or their loved ones, they need to suffer right along with those who oppose Trump and will not be silenced.  It could possibly be the basis for greater American unity, for a joining together of more of us in being careful with our fragile democracy being assaulted so grievously now.  Maybe many more will come to see """"Political Correctness"""" as being about civil talk with those we find different or do not understand, rather then talk that feeds our prejudices and destroys the innate dignity of others.  But we may have to lose a lot of that in order to fully regain it.  I think that unity comes from common suffering, like how shipwreck victims band together to swim to shore.  The ship has crashed, I believe.  Will we save ourselves AND others?

To blame Donald Trump as they and the media relentlessly does, is to miss the teaching moment that Trump has offered. Will they learn? Not a chance.

0,"The Florida Cuban-American voters continue to punch above their weight in political power. The US has a policy of constructive engagement with China and Vietnam two other remaining communist countries. With some degree of success. Economic freedom has improved greatly and has helped to keep the world a safer place by entangling their economies with the West. And while human rights has not improved at the same place it is safe to say China is better today than when Nixon first went to see Mao in '72 and Vietnam since the war. Quiet diplomacy and sustained pressure from within these countries will win the day - not public lecturing from Western nations.  I would agree with the author. Trump's motivation I suspect is more transactional and less to do with human rights.

And why are people so obsessed with what this First Lady or any First Lady wears? So what if Melania Trump's shoes or other clothing are by fancy designers? She can afford them. Would people feel any better if she bought her clothes from the sales rack at Goodwill or Salvation Army? I think it's sexist to criticize any First Lady for the clothes she wears. As long as she shows up for her functions clean and presentable, who cares what she wears? Donald Trump wanted to be president and now he is. His actions or policies are legitimate targets of criticism. And I think he's a lousy president. But, I wish people would quit criticizing Melania Trump over every minor thing.

Singh's egalitarianism is attractive, but social equality does nothing for  millions on the bottom 50% of the income ladder. Unfortunately, as we've seen with Obama, Hillary Clinton, and even Donald Trump, economic justice is not part of the Establishment's program.  The more things change the more they stay the same, with the exception of the relentless and ruthless move to the corporate right wing. In the wake of the worst economic meltdown since 1929, Canadians wanted to move a bit back to the left (very astute voters), but the NDP blew it, allowing Justin's right-of-centre Liberals to outflank them on the left (lol).

Ford had no strength of will, Carter was incomptent, Reagan had Iran-Contra, Clinton was a liar and sexual assault artist,  Both Bushes had some integrity problems.

President Bill Clinton gave the nation a national budget surplus during his eight-year term.  What happened next?  The Republicans racked up the first $7 trillion in debt and still counting.  China and Japan will own America if they don't already, and Trump's worried more about Mexicans crossing the border?  We heard and witnessed the same campaign slogan from billionaire Ross Perot and look what happened to him.  Trump may have made it pass the Republican primaries, but I don't believe he'll make it pass the general election.  When Trump  loses the White House, mark my words, his narcissistic personality will sue the United States.  Haha

Junking common core would be lovely.  Of course, the prospect of authoritarianism is troubling, especially as the Donald meets a permanent bureaucracy which will not follow him into lawlessness.  K : Trump is experienced in going with his gut, however if he has any kind of professional staff they will chafe at letting him.  Of course, this gives us the prospect of clever Republican operatives playing him like a fiddle.  Kind of like Cheney played Bush.

Yes, I am saying it... anyone who hasn't read the """"The Art of the Deal"""": is not informed with respect to this election cycle, and this administration.  We've already see ample evidence of this with numerous companies changing business plans based on Trump's threats(initial bargaining positions). There has not been one tariff applied; yet, the very mention of it has persuaded companies and countries to change direction. THIS betrays their ACTUAL WEAK POSITION on all fronts.

The words spoken attempt to create division, between East and West, between Christian and Muslim and create enemies of anyone that doesn't conform to Trump's interpretation of 'Western Ideals.' Maybe its time to be reminded that justice, equality and humanity are the foundations of democracy and of the 'West' and that fanning the flames of fear through division, hatred and mistrust has the power to undo it. In the words of the late former SA Pres. Mandela: """"peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference. Religion, ethnicity, language, social and cultural practices are elements which enrich human civilization, adding to the wealth of our diversity.

0,"The first thing people need to realize is that Trump's tax plan doesn't add up, given his other initiatives.     In fact, it points to a huge increase in their deficit and a huge increase in debt.    Combine that with Trump's protectionist rhetoric.     It sounds really great to bring back jobs to the U.S., but with that comes higher costs which WILL be passed on to the consumers.   Then there's healthcare costs.  The second thing people need to know is what's involved in moving to the U.S. and what the long-term implications are from a tax perspective.    I've worked in the U.S. so know a little bit about it.    As a green-card holder, you can work for up to 7 years.     After that, you will be subject to the U.S. Exit taxes which are prohibitively high.     The only way to avoid that is to move back before, or take out U.S. citizenship.

Worst of all is that, unwittingly or not, Trump has played the role of dancing monkey to Putin's organ grinder.  Meanwhile, back in the Kremlin, Putin rests content with his latest coup, that of placing his man in the White House.  One wonders when one hears Trump speak on matters of foreign policy, trade and human rights whether one is really hearing Trump, or actually hearing Putin's puppet.  It's no wonder we're already seeing stories in the news that report traditional U.S. allies don't trust America anymore when it comes to sharing intelligence information because they know Putin has a direct line to the White House.

The idea that one nation can invade and occupy another, and then use that country's economic resources to pay for the invasion, is a repugnant affront to international law and the Charter of the United Nations.  Once a nation undertakes a lengthy occupation of another country, it always co-opts the country's political apparatus. The less developed and more prone to corruption that apparatus is, the easier it is for the occupying nation to influence it. Afghanistan has the weakest 'democracy' on the planet, with high levels of corruption.

0,"Just to be clear, I don't believe a word that comes out of Trump's mouth... so the content of his speech is irrelevant to me.  It is the actions he takes that will determine his impact as President.  That being said, it is HILARIOUS to watch all of Canada's poorly educated immigration hawks stumble all over themselves when they come to the realization that the model Canada follows is actually envied by other countries.  Most of these hawks see people sneaking across the border and they confuse immigrants with refugees.  Their knowledge is largely superficial and based on biased viewpoints like Rebel.  Canada's immigration policy delivers us great contributors to our society.  Further, our sponsored refugee policy is also admired around the world for doing a great job of helping refugees integrate into our society. I think it's time Canada's immigration hawks set aside their petty biases and learn what's going on instead of just complaining about it.

Semantics is at play here & in most controversies. Semantics reflect the dynamic nature of what a philosophy is at any precise time.  So beware of labels, as they may obscure the person, or philosophy's true nature.  Trump is for American Nationalism, pragmatic government, & personal freedom, including the freedom to be imperfect - as we all are imperfect.  So concentrate on the core issues, ignore the smoke & fog, try to be objective,  as we hope & pray for good, ConstitutionaL government at all levels in our exceptional country. Amen.

I conclude it is because the libbers themselves harbor so much hate and resentment that they project their own feelings onto any words that are the slightest bit ambiguous as in can be interpreted in many ways.

0,"I had given a """"+"""" to Trump because of his opposition to the carried-interest tax break (worth $3 billion a year to just 20 hedge fund managers!) as it is a clear example of a rich special interest gaming the system by shoveling money at politicians. I've since turned that to a """"-"""" as his full tax plan proposal is known, since he would turn the low carried interest rate into an even lower pass through income rate. The low pass-through income tax rate was a centerpiece of the Brownback/Kansas reform that has blasted that state.

I can't, unless he brought along a group of homeless people as his guests. Also, the Church should play a peacemaking role whenever possible; I can't think of a worse way to reduce the bitterness of this election than to force the candidates to make jokes about each other. Given the tone of this election, especially Donald Trump's long history of cruel remarks, the organizers of this fundraiser should have eliminated the """"roast"""" portion of the event.

0,"Trump sullies the reputation of people who have signed on with him. The respected general H.R. McMaster, now the national security adviser, humiliated himself by trying—presumably under orders—to combat the Washington Post story on May 15 that Trump had revealed highly classified intelligence about ISIS to Lavrov and Kislyak.  Trump’s reckless act is believed to have endangered the life of an Israeli intelligence asset who had been planted among ISIS forces, something extremely hard to pull off. Trump’s mishandling of the intelligence provoked dismay in Washington.  People can have a hard time recognizing that they’ve been conned. And Trump is skilled at flimflam, creating illusions. But how long can he keep blaming his failures to deliver on others—Democrats, the “dishonest media,” the Washington “swamp”? None of this is knowable yet. What is knowable is that an increasingly agitated Donald Trump’s hold on the presidency is beginning to slip.  Elizabeth Drew, May 25, 2017

She has been investigated for thirty years by several Departments of Justice, special prosecutors, and both houses of Congress, none of which have found anything to charge her with. The whole thing of course was nothing more than a big circus intended to convince gullible people with little wit that HRC is a crook, when she is not. If any of those actors had been able to find a crime, they most certainly would have locked her up. She's too smart to lie to a grand jury about something that isn't their business anyway.

On top of everything else, he’s just really really dumb — and of course he remains blissfully unaware of this.

As he occasionally paid lip service to other constituencies in order to """"expand his base"""", the base itself remained, and remains, steadfastly racist. Steve Bannon's chief function in the campaign and in the White House is to serve a guarantor to the base that Trump will and does remain faithful to the racist roots of his campaign. His refusal to attend the NAACP Convention is not only because he's a coward (although he is certainly that); it's also and especially because he doesn't want the base to think he's softening. The base -- the ones who will support him even if he shoots someone on Fifth Ave., the 'Deplorables' -- the base remains racist: always was, always will be. Trump too.

0,"Jimbo, I don't know if you and Saunders are naïve or just have your  heads in the sand.  It is essentially the ineffectiveness of the UN and NATO and their lack of action in civil wars with despot leaders.  The UN has China and Russia with their vetoes. Basically China wanting access to resources and Russia markets for their military equipment sales therefore blocking every positive action. NATO hides behind the American coattails with the likes of Trudeau and Merkel refusing to put their military at risk.  American presidents have been frustrated with the amount they have to spend to be the world s policeman.  Even Trump understood this but someone had to react to the dire results in Syria. Jimbo, remarkably naïve policies such as Trudeau sanctioning 27 Syrian leaders are never going to work.   NATO is going to have to step up and protect the innocent because the UN is a lost cause. Surely Jimbo and Saunders can understand sometimes the policeman has to use the gun.

0,"I didn't cast a """"protest vote"""".  Your last line says it all.""""hope you folks learned a lesson"""". It is the democratic establishment that should have learned a lesson, but apparently didn't. I was a member of the democratic party and I was a Sanders delegate. During the local caucus I heard several people agree that Sanders was the better candidate but they """"had"""" to support Clinton. She was """"proven"""" blah, blah, blah and they had to nominate her in order to defeat trump. How did that work out? After the election, I went to a local democratic party meeting that was supposed to address the mistakes that were made and make changes to the party. After the meeting, I resigned from the party. The next week I changed my party registration from democrat to independent. There were no changes. The party loyalists just wanted to scam people and make them believe that there was a change. Same people, same ideas.

0,"Written like a diplomat, Mr. Robertson and I mean that positively.  One thing I disagree with you on is the importance of Mexico and standing with Mexico in the coming days of uncertainty in the Canada-US relationship.  As the last liberal minded western leader standing and someone who likes to tweet silly stuff almost as much as Trump does, Trudeau may annoy and even alienate Trump with his left wing bromides and policies quite enough without entering into a relationship with Mexico that may seem hostile to US interests.  PM Trudeau needs to make it clear which partner is his top priority.  And it is not Mexico or China.  Something I whole heartedly endorse in your column is the need for our lighter-than-air leader to be surrounded with more capable and experienced people when dealing with Trump and his impressive team of successful leaders.  Yes, Justin needs to appoint a Deputy PM to deal with VP Pence.  And yes he needs to be surrounded by capable ministers when meeting with Trump.
"
0,"This points in this article are well presented and I agree for the most part, yet it still seems that the process of reconciliation of nations within one country is not linear and scientific, that the creation of a wider social narrative in the service of reconcilliation always contains fact and fiction, which motivate and serve the agendas of the day. Some charismatic leaders spin lies to allow their electorate to engage in retrograde behaviour (see Trump). Others produce charismatic art, which, even though perhaps at a remove from academic truth, adds to this narrative by inspiring people to imagine the 'other' and move closer to a progressive reconciliation and understanding.  It would seem Boyden's 'lies' have only been in service of 1st Nations issues.  Surely to insist on probing the murky depths and process of a novelist is to remove what was otherwise a positive addition to this narrative and turn it into yet another divisive act in a long and painful process.

0,"I think the increase in race and religion based harassment can be traced directly to President Trump. He spent his whole campaign mainstreaming hate, and making it acceptable.

Also let's not forget that days before Trump's decision to bomb the airport, he announced that there was nothing he could do about Assad. What changed his mind?

0,"I have to agree. As a woman, I was a bit sad that I could feel no urgency about the 'cause' - mostly because I didn't see the point.  As Ms. Wente says, women's rights are not likely to be rolled back, and in any event, for all that he's a creepy old groper, I didn't get the feeling that Donald Trump gives any thought to women's rights one way or another (the abortion thing sounds like one of his sops to right wing supporters, and, as mentioned in this article, unlikely to be a right taken away from women).  As for the fact that Trump actually got elected and sworn in, I'd suggest opponents focus on what he IS planning to do, and determine how to safeguard those things worth safeguarding instead of empty protests.  Most issues will lie in the areas of government spending,  trade and protectionism.  His inaugural speech reminded me more than anything else of a CEO laying out an austerity budget for their company (rather like the company where I just finished a contract).

0,"It's amusing to see how far into the sand Trump supporters are willing to plug their heads.  1. Trump ran on the promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. 2. Rudy Giuliani has admitted that Trump asked him to come up with a Muslim ban that would be legal. 3. The executive order bans entry from seven Muslim countries, but with exceptions for religious minorities. 4. Courts around the U.S. are overturning the ban because it is unconstitutional to deny entry based on religion.  So, your transparently semantic argument holds no water. Trump said he would ban Muslims, asked Giuliani to draft a ban order that would be legal, signed an order that effectively bans Muslims and is being challenged in the courts for unconstitutionally banning Muslims.
"
0,"The ironic bit is how much Trump praised and encouraged leaks when the subject was his political opponent.  It also puts Wikileaks' supposed principles to the lie, because they condemn the White House leaks as being illegal even though that characterizes the vast majority of their source material. (From WL Twitter in January: """"The Obama admin/CIA is illegally funneling TOP SECRET//COMINT information to NBC for political reasons before PEOTUS even gets to read it."""")  Wikileaks, despite claims to be encouraging unlimited transparency, doesn't leak anything damaging to Trump or Russia (they also condemned the Panama Papers, which implicated many Putin associates, despite those being clearly in broad public interest).  It's nice to see that there are still brave people in the US administration who can step up where self-aggrandizing cowards fall short.

He's starting off with the lowest approval ratings of any incoming president (that I am aware of). He's spending the positive bump normally associated with taking the oath of office. How do you feel about the President lying? Obama has been accused of it, and probably has lied. Can't the President do """"whatever he wants,"""" including lying to the people?

I point out that I didn't vote for Hillary, and that I have now voted for Gary Johnson in 2 elections.  Trump die-hard then pokes fun at Aleppo flub.  I admit that it was a flub, but that Johnson seems to be willing to learn something he doesn't know.  Trump die-hard then points out Trump's business """"success"""".  I then point out how Johnson began a handy-man business in college that grew to over 1000 employees, has never filed for bankruptcy in order to not pay people back, and did it without a $1 million check from his daddy to get started (never mind his being a 2-term GOP governor in a Democrat state).  Sometimes I add in Trump's empty promises on the border wall, or his hypocrisy on his jobs coming back to the US.  This is followed usually by either more deflection, or personal insults.

No members of the Trump administration were in contact with this hostile foreign power during the campaign, there was no collusion or cooperation between them and everything ends up having perfectly innocent explanations. It's still good to have done the investigation. If nothing else - it limits the damage Trump's insanity agenda can otherwise achieve by keeping him busy.  My faith in their story would be stronger if Trump didn't keep contradicting his own white house by denying his own staff's official explanations for things that happen.

Whatever her motivation she was no whistleblower--  while he's a  friend of Trump, Putin is no friend of America and Manning gave Russia a great treasure of dangerous information.  Having served in the USASA  1959-61 in Germany monitoring top-secret  Soviet military transmissions I find Manning's behavior appalling.  However, on the Israel settlement  UN vote I think Krauthammer  was dead wrong-- Obama was right in allowing the other nations on the Security Council to forcefully express  their views without being stifled by an American veto.  There is but one peaceful outcome in the Middle East, and that is the two-state solution; these settlements destroy that option.

Certainly those who voted against him knew he was lying about it; they recognized that he lies about everything. I'm interested in the voters who were not part of the base, but who bought into the lie that Wimpy knew something about healthcare, that he cared about it, that he cared about them; who actually believed the lie that he had a plan to simultaneously repeal the ACA and replace it with healthcare for everyone, with better coverage and for less money.

This technique is very widely used by the Right AND by the RRs(Religious Right).

He USED this technique to force voters into putting the Republicans in power. THEN he could use GOP hate and venom to go after what he really wanted -- his real true goal.

She strikes me as somebody who doesn't care about U.S. politics, so she was probably clueless about Michelle's speech. But none of us really knows the whole story.  I don't dismiss Melania Trump as an innocent victim, but I do feel sorry for her. She's been made an object of national ridicule and been publicly humiliated by her husband's adulteries, all while being dragged into a political freak show she clearly doesn't like or understand.  When I think of her, the Eagles classic """"Lyin' Eyes"""" comes to mind, about a young woman who marries a rich older man and winds up in lonely despair. Sometimes the choices people make for their own comfort and security end up backfiring. It might be their own fault (or it might not, we don't know), but either way they still deserve compassion.

I'm amazed by these young (and not-so-young) people who put their lives on the line in the name of the United States, especially when the US has been so careless with lives in its many ill-conceived military adventures.

Nixon was forced to respond to the triple whammy of a rampant civil rights movement, a powerful anti-war movement, and an effective environmental revolution, whatever his other faults:  One can only hope that Trump, with his autocratic and divisive style, sparks such revolutions and is forced, as a servant of the public, to respond to them in kind.  The difference is that back then the media was more diversified in ownership, and public movements were able to gain control of its coverage to their advantage.

Always! Without them we likely would not have made it through the cold war era. The Democrats continually imply that Trump or people in his inner circle are somehow secret Russian agents working against American interests and it's simply not true. If America is to defeat our greatest threat (Islamic terrorism), Russian assistance will be needed just as it was needed to defeat Hitler in WWII. Not since Hitler has the world seen such evil, and as we did then the world needs to come together and wipe this Islamic terrorist scourge from the face of the earth. Trump is not wrong about that.

He likes to brag about the size of his crowds and his Electoral College victory and his Virginia winery, despite his boasts being easily disproved.  I went back and checked the Globe's coverage. They did not guarantee a Clinton victory. They went over the odds and reported that the polls were tightening as election night approached and pointed out which states Trump needed to flip to win. Trump did lose the popular vote and only won the Electoral college because three states narrowly went for him when they'd been polling for Clinton earlier.

Donald just does it better than anyone else. In hindsight the hatred of politicians and the love of capitalism, along with the negligence of the comfortable middle class and the suffering of the working class, made the rise of a corporate demagogue inevitable.  However, I commend this writer for her astute and prescient prediction that Trump would win. I well remember how almost everyone here trashed her columns for an entire year. I thought they were very good, But like everyone else in the liberal media, she was one-sided. She tried to make Hillary the winner by refusing to criticize her.  At the same time, protecting the Hillary-Obama cabal of do-nothings and trashing Trump was the way middle class liberals protected themselves from guilt. That did not work. Today they are still unrepentant.

Donald Trump is not only a liar, he has based his career on lies.  You may call that a """"personal aspect"""", but I consider it germane to his qualification to be president.  This is not a policy disagreement, which I can accept; this calls into question his basic ethical foundation, which I consider to be built on the sand of duplicity.  I respect your intelligence, Outsider, but I sometimes think there are holes through which you allow primitive impulses to pass.  That is entirely my suspicion, and I hope it is not true.  Otherwise, I think you are a smart and entertaining raconteur.

The more Trump loses in court, the more egg you see on Trump's face, and he has bragged that he's a winner throughout his campaign.

I am indeed saying “Obama would have been able to detect and stop home-grown terror events” - -  after all Bush did for 88 consecutive months. Obama failed to do so because he hates America and wants to destroy (“transform”) it. He defended Islamic Terrorists attacking our homeland and did all in his power to facilitate their assaults at home and abroad.  As for “you certainly can use tortured logic to make him look bad”, Obama needs no help - - in looking bad he has done ALL the heavy lifting.  Charlottesville was no “domestic terror event” but legitimate and long over due pushback against the American Taliban (e.g. you) who want to distort history and pull America down.

However the comment regarding Douglas' thesis relate to the potential for Trump style politics and policies that reflect fear of the other in Canada. . Douglas wrote his thesis when Jewish people fleeing Germany were refused entry to Canada.   To suggest his views weren't influential/prevalent in politics at that time is...... obtuse. . There are many people who would welcome a Trump type politician in Canada.  Some are already trying to emulate his m.o.   It's important that Canadians do not dismiss the possibility and become complacent.

Over the next six hours, he adopted four different positions on abortion.  And since then, he's uttered scarcely a word about it.  Moreover, no-one who mocks the handicapped can ever be seen as pro-life.  This is a disqualifying defect of character.  To describe such a candidate as “pro-life” is to reduce the term to meaninglessness.

So at the end of the day I still sense you make the claim that as an entrepreneur you should be entitled to reap these rewards with this easy money.  However what I would like to know at the end of the day what is better for the tax payer?.....for the government to reap the rewards and offset our taxes, while hiring more workers and for better wages in strategic locales, or for a handful of people to become 100x millionaires?  Few very large organizations are always well run.. look at the banks, big Telco's such as Rogers and Bell, big Pharma and their greed at the expense of the many; who bailed out GM and Chrysler; Stelco.  So in my opinion the government does okay, not great, but at least they provide meaningful wages that helps local economies.  Investors always give themselves too much credit.

BUT, Jill Stein gets to keep the millions of dollars raised for the recount. Hm. Bottom line is that Hillary is a media junkie and her monthly overhead is pretty high.

What you seem to be missing is that Trump could care less about his campaign slogan """"make America great again,"""" and all the promises that came with it.  His only concern is using the presidency to enrich himself and his children.  And boy is he ever succeeding at that!  Trump, the president, is commanding a much higher price for the use of his name - much more then Trump, the man, ever did.  The money is pouring in globally.  He even has the squeeze on the American people's tax dollars.  We're paying him rent now at Trump Tower.  As despicable as we find him, we cannot deny that he will have the last laugh, all the way to the bank.
