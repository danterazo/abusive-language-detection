0,"More Trump Hysteria from yet another snowflake. Do these  politicos think for one minute that ANY of us believes for one second that Russia is going to invade Canada one day soon ? Just how stupid do they think people are ? How does disinformation affect joe nobody ? Nobody believes anything anymore anyways. Especially the Media. Politicos have always held number one spot in the lies department. Give us a break. It would be more interesting to just find out if its true about grandpappy. Judging by the Russians ban on her, I'd say Yes , but that's just a guess.

"
0,"I agree the world order is changing, however for the last number of years even longer there has been a widespread push for the States to stop meddling in the world. Certainly the last years of the Obama years saw just such a retreat.. Obviously there is much to dislike about Trump, but the """"hawks"""" are re-emerging in the States and if challenged Trump will defer to the hawks. Trump's base may wish to a certain degree for the States to pull inward, but there is that mentality that the States can not be seen to shoved aside. There is a certain reverse psychology at play here, where if the States is written off as being weak and countries lack confidence in it, then the States will revert to assuming its prominent place as the world's policeman.

0,"I'm no fan of Trump or Kushner, but what he did pales in comparison to what Clinton did. He used an email account, forwarded the emails to his government account,  none were classified, and fully cooperated when asked about it. Clinton used an entirely private email server, possibly exposed highly classified data, and deleted 30k+ emails when investigated. Both did it intentionally, but Clinton acted insanely shady about it and was in a much more powerful position, making the crime much worse.

0,"I appreciate Trump appealing to Kim's vanity by saying he would be """"honoured"""" to meet with him. At first it seems inappropriate to use such a word in reference to this nut-bar tyrant but it is psychologically the right move to publicly give Kim face saving leeway to have a diplomatic meeting. At the same time the US constantly reminds them that military action is being prepared.

0,"Only the Hillary Liberal sheep wouldn't do their homework and find that the Clinton's claimed a 700,000 capital loss on last year's taxes.  But as long as health care and education will be free for everyone, they all follow the CNN slander against Trump.
"
0,"AMEN!  I have always voted for republicans, sometimes holding my nose, but I will never vote for Trump.  If Sanders wins, despite disagreeing with him on nearly every policy issue, he will get my vote because he is honest, has not been bought and paid for, and has a warm heart and smile too (these things matter in politics).  I think one could make an agreement with Bernie, shake hands, and sleep well knowing that you had a deal.  This is not true of Hillary.  But if the Dems push Bernie aside and choose the preordained Hillary then I will vote for any reasonable third party candidate and if there is none then I have agreed to write in my neighbors dog.
"
0,"After the various events of the last few weeks there is almost certainly not a president or prime minister of any western democracy who thinks that there is a shred of value in trying to talk to or negotiate with Trump. This makes the road ahead more than a bit murky but, clearly, the world is going to have to find solutions to trade issues and other problems without any help from the White House.

"
1,"President Trump is challenging the establishment that includes almost all Democrats and many RINOs (the John McCain and Lindsey Graham types)  that are riding the gravy train  peddling political influence to lobbyists and others involved in their back-room funding.  His first order of business once all of his major appointments are confirmed is to instruct his cabinet to purge their departments of the  Obama, Clinton, Lynch, Holder, and Kerry appointees and deputy positions so these people are not in a position to undermine his domestic and foreign policy efforts.  Throw out the trash and drain the swamp.   And let the press belch out their vomit as they will regardless as it is their nature.

"
1,"I have not denied any of Trump's depolorable rhetoric; as I've said before several times - I voted for Clinton. But you just keep hurling these insults at voters who elected the guy & pretend that the policies that the GOP has pushed are simply A-OK or unrelated.  The GOP was in serious trouble before Trump ever ran, & had he lost the election, would still be in trouble because the policies have been stale & shop-worn.  As for Ryan, while I like some his proposals, I've lost a lot o respect for him after his pussy-footing """"non-endorsement/endorsement"""" of Trump. He showed himself to me be a feckless leader unwilling to have the courage to say """"no."""" He has proven himself worthy of many of the criticisms hurled at him: as someone who wants to be taken seriously as a political figure, but ultimately unwilling to pay any sort of price to get there. And so far as you whitewash or ignore his own role in creating this mess, then I'm afraid you are missing the underlying challenge for the GOP.

0,"keep in mind that trump was elected by just 27% of eligible voters, 90M of us didnt care enough to vote at all and a majority of them are under 25 years old. to me this means 73% of us didnt vote for him. surely we can make enough noise to keep him in line. his current picks for cabinet and department posts sucks of course, all old, white, christian men. where have i seen that before? but just today he said there are parts of obamacare he likes. dont sell this clown too short. lets see what happens the first week after jan. 20.

0,"Under Obama/Clinton it was the same. A coup in Honduras was supported by Ms Clinton. This has turned Honduras into the world's most violent country.  It's a good article by Mr Caplan.  We keep hearing how terrible Trump is but I believe US militarism, regime-changes, etc, are systemic American agressions that are not being opposed or addressed.  Of course the other issue is, all the talk about 'evil' Russia but then you look at America and they're ten times worse.

0,"I gotta apologize to all of you who have been complaining that the """"Civil  Comments"""" system isn't fair.  . It didn't bother me---I'd never flagged nor been flagged nor had a comment removed so just sorta thought folks were blowing hot air, that if they got a comment booted they must have deserved it.  Frankly, using my own name I'm not about to post anything  uncivil that's going to reflect  badly on me, so it was a non-issue. Until today.  Reading Goldberg and Krauthammer's columns  I got a kick out  of seeing the way they both were struggling  with Trump and the Republicans so posted a note to that effect on both.  Krauthammer's attack  on Hillary Clinton for being """"uninspiring"""", suggesting a reason for voting for Trump, was fun to satirize, and I cheerfully posted my comment.  To my surprise I received a message stating it was deleted  because it was """"below the threshold of civil comments"""" or some such thing...says who?  Says what?  Says why?  A couple more of this................!
"
0,"Its kind of ironic that poor old Mexico is being blamed for stealing jobs from the US when the inclusion of Mexico in NAFTA was precisely to include a low wage country where corporations could acccess cheap labor in order to make bigger profits.Did the Mexicans kidnap the US corporations? No they left freely and made out like bandits on the backs of poor Mexiacan workers... and now its their faulT? Trump should blame his own greedy US corporations, including himself I believe for the sucking sound as jobs went south, just as they would have gone to Vietnam or Malaysia if the TPP had been implemented.

Just to be clear he is 6 months in today which many liberals swore would never happen. Every day longer he is in office will put him closer to s second and possibly a third Supreme Court Justice.  Hating Trump does not wipe away the false statements from Team Obama and Team Hillary.

0,"What we know is that Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss: an understatement actual number is $916,122,780.18-  Pence said Trump would """"lower taxes across the board for working families"""".

It ends with """"Trump has consistently said that he would not touch the program"""". You confirmed what he said. Whats the point?  """"There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day President Obama"""" took office, Pence said. U say: """"probably not"""" is a probability- a guess- not fact.  """"Kaine said Hillary Clinton eliminated the Iran nuclear weapons program.""""u say a stretch""""- its a flat out lie  Its apparent the only fact that is factual in this article is in the comments made by Larry Davis.
"
0,"I just love the protests against the facility.  It totally shows me the hypocrisy of Eugene's libbers.  Merciless criticism against Trump for """"protecting"""" the country from potentially violent, terror bent, middle eastern non-citizens, while unending resistance against local efforts to help those who have made mistakes from re-entering society to make productive contributions.  The ex-cons involved are American citizens.  Because of background checks and such finding a place to live or to work is extremely difficult.  We have turned them into refugees within their own country, yet the libbers do not wish to grant them asylum.  I could understand protests against certain types of ex-cons such as pre-meditated murders, violent rapists, etc., but wanting to shut down the whole project is a reaction that trumps even Trump.
"
1,"Trump doesn't realize it, but he's setting himself up to be impeached. If he thinks the Republican leadership wouldn't prefer Pence to be POTUS he's delusional.
"
1,"You know, it looks like your right: he was just sued and the case was withdrawn after she got a settlement in a parallel case.   April 1997, Jill Harth Houraney filed a $125,000,000 lawsuit against Trump for sexual harassment in 1993, claiming he """"'groped' her under her dress and told her he wanted to make her his 'sex slave'"""". Harth voluntarily withdrew the suit when her husband settled a parallel case. Trump has called the allegations """"meritless"""".  Put into context with other contemporaneous claims, though, and an obvious pattern emerges. It may not all be true but you're fooling yourself if you think none of it is.  I'm glad, however, that we both seem to agree that Trump was bragging about things he has done (that's what exploits are). I've heard a lot of salty talk in my day, never once had someone talk about just grabbing women. Pretty weak and disgusting.

"
1,"Rod one does not have to use specific words to meet the criteria of exhibiting tendencies. It is a childish argument to indicate he did not say a specific word when his intent wass clear to the audience. Over the campaign Donald made many statements indicating his views on other races, women and religions.  Should I start with the Trump comment about the Mexican judge overseeing his trial. Or maybe the all Mexicans who come here are rapist, thieves, and drug dealers.  Certainly his recorder statement about his grabbing women stands by itself as indicative of his views on women.  Did sure you missed all those?

0,"Two comments.  It is possible, to put it mildly, that the Washington bureaucracy has become so large, so entrenched, and so focused on territory and status that making it work as a team is beyond human ability, especially Donald Trump's.

0,"There is no conservative candidate in this election. Johnson comes closest but Clinton is a liberal and Trump a populist. Both promise to expand executive power.
"
0,"There are many reasons to vote for Trump.  First is renegotiating NAFTA and US-China trade agreement. The impact of renegotiation strikes deep into uplifting US economy when US manufacturers would find it more profitable to manufacture products in the US instead of China, Mexico and other countries.  Then there is the Trump tax cuts.  Those 2 alone would mean jobs, jobs, jobs, for all Americans.  The liberal mainstream media is rigging this election with a relentless and unceasing smearing of Trump as racist a bigot, anti-Muslim etc.  Trump accused Democrats as looking at Blacks as votes and asked Blacks to vote for him for jobs, education, and safety - """"“You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed,” he said. “What the hell do you have to lose?”  Liberal media offered nothing for Blacks except to distract viewers by Trump smears.
"
0,"Please stop making this problem about the President. If you want to make this country a better place  try this:  Go to a neighborhood where people don't look like you and start perhaps with the local pastor and community leader , and offer to help bring people together.  YES I HAVE done this ( in the Park Hill Neighbor hood of Denver) and I need to get back into it.  STOP blaming Obama, Trump for these issues. Social engineering is not the JOB of the government or the president. It is the job of the people to break down these barriers and misconceptions about each other. The racists and bigots are going to rally  and hate regardless and the government is not the answer to fix this.  This argument over how insincere his denouncement  was  has nothing to do with your power to help. He  can denounce until he is green in the face and it is not going to change anybody.
"
0,"No. We're up in arms because we knew his talk was all an act to get him elected by by people gullible enough to vote for him. He would do or say anything to get the red states riled up.

The joke is on the ones that voted for him.  Haha.
"
0,"When two people are in a race and one looses the looser can always claim he didn't lose. The looser might say that he  almost won and came in second. That is what you are seeing in this case - classic political spin using what we now call """"alternate facts"""".  Senator Sullivan was excluded from day 1.  Had this bill passed the Senate it was headed to conference committee and, despite his wishes and self-professed confidence, Junior Senator Dan Sullivan would have had no influence.  Senator Sullivan should now work for Alaskans to solve this problem using what John McCain described as the normal process  not some secretive short cut only intended to score political points for the Trump Administration. .

0,"Let's keep in mind that the Trump administration is not carrying out this environmental crime on their own.....they enjoy the support of virtually the entire Republican Party.  Being in control of the government, the GOP is arguably the most destructive force on Earth, working hard to destroy the livability of the planet, not just for humanity, but for every living thing on Earth.  We must also remember to keep thanking HRC supporters for nominating the least trusted and least popular Democratic candidate in history, handing over the nation to Trump and the Republican Party. Unfortunately most Clintonites are living in denial, completely ignoring their role in this disaster and not learning any lessons.

Further - and most damning - he fired him to take the pressure of being investigated recRussia off him. Tell me, if Trump is innocent, why would he be stressed about being investigated? Tell me, how you or anyone else can possibly believe that Trump fired Comey because he wronged Hillary Clinton? Only a moron would believe that. As for your assertion that Trump is crazy like a fox; would that was true.

I'm worried that some people here (it is probably uncivil to describe them as bomb-throwing ventilators, something I don't really think) and, more likely, a vast swath of Americans will come to view Trump's America as normal.

0,"Democrats have begun to fall victim to creations of their own making. The coarseness of this election was, in part, a result of people being called ignorant, racist, nazi, etc. for  questioning  liberal orthodoxy. When you continually take public discourse to the gutter, even your opposition will go there eventually. They got Trump and he was happy to meet them there. College presidents that have to step down over supposed issues raised by snowflake students, rioting and murder rates in democrat controlled cities, all of the victim groups that now want their issues addressed. The Bernie Sanders phenomenon was a group of people who were made to believe that socialism actually is a superior form of government. If put into practice, it could threaten the big money benefactors of the democrat party. Can't have that. It's been about power and control for the democrats for a long time. They achieved it by creating a grievance society that they, as the establishment, could not always control.

For all the talk about conservative principles we selected a guy whose only core conviction is his own greatness.

And, Iran is watching, so it's refusing inspections of its nuclear activity.  And, Russia is doing wargames in East and Northern Europe.  Trump is a disaster.  He's really screwed the pooch.  He empowered NK.

0,"Tipton, Gardner, be honest for once. Stop blaming the ACA and put the blame squarely where it belongs: The Republicans and Trump who have done everything possible to cause the instability that gives the profiteering insurance companies the excuse to raise rates. Their blaming of the ACA is predictable, but they fail to recognize that the voters are now fully aware of the sabotage their own party created against the ACA to help it fail.  We know the ACA could work and we know the Rs don't want it. So, Gardner, Tipton: thank you for helping to make insurance coverage unaffordable. We will remember you at election time, and we won't be congratulating you for your false claims against the ACA. Be prepared for harsh words at your next Townhall meeting. LoL. Single Payer is the way to go. Health insurance was too expensive before the ACA, that's why the ACA was created in the first place, and the Rs ignored the facts then. They don't care about you now.  Take the profit out of health care.

As far as I'm concerned, your side is obsessed with throwing Hillary Clinton in jail. The White House staff is in chaos, although now that Scaramucci is gone and Kelly is chief of staff, maybe that will cease. Donald Trump makes ridiculous comments about police brutality and tries to fire thousands of armed forces members by tweet. Congressional Republicans haven't started on tax reform, tie themselves in knots on health-insurance reform, and can only get laws passed that repeal Obama-era regulations. But, hey! Let's prosecute Hillary Clinton! That'll keep the citizens preoccupied! Bring on the bread and circuses!

If that is truly the reason (and I think not), then why didn't Trump dismiss Comey on day one or two of the start of his regime? Trump's action smacks of an attempt to terminate the """"Russia-gate"""" investigation. I wonder if Trump knows what the penalty is for treason? Trump is a menace to the United States of America and a clear and present danger to the U.S. Constitution.

The reason they lack """"legs"""" is that each of these incidents came down to a """"he said/she said,"""" which shouldn't surprise anybody.

AND Trump's FTA has every right to audit the Oahu rail project and can 'anonymously' release the complete rip off failure of the Oahu rail project to the nation & the world.  The damage is not so much there will be some dropoff in tourism, the REAL hit is other that military spending in Hawaii, Trump has every right to greatly reduce or eliminate federal funds and subsidies that Hawaii depends on and that money is MAJOR.

People with little training and education will not be persuaded that something familiar to them has changed permanently and they need to adapt. A changing environment, whether physical or cultural or economic, requires adaptation in order to survive. These folks, unfortunately, hooked their wagon to an imploding star (Trump) and they will crash when he does. In the meantime they will see their familiar livelihoods disappear as power companies adapt, as they must, to lower cost fuels. That adaptation has nothing to do with pollution or global warming since it is entirely based in economics. As such, nothing Trump does will have any impact on the trend. Even as mediocre a businessman he is he still should understand that.

"
0,"The same answer as it was when people were screaming about Obama's trips to Europe and Asia.    The security for an American president is very expensive.     People that don't know a thing about what it takes, like me or yourself, are just spitting in the wind.   What is youi life tells you how much President Obama or President Trump needs for security?  Not a darn thing,    Neither man gets to hide behind a fake name and each will recieve thousands of death threats before their term ends.  I have no problems with America's president being a world leader.   Let me correct that, I think it's critical for an American president to be a world leader.   That means showing respect and consideration to other nations and not arrogantly asking them to come calling at an American throne.  Trump is going to take some serious security when he travels abroad.    I doubt any nation will be jumping up and down to invite him over for dinner, it's going to cost them a pretty penny.
"
0,"Very sad because not standing up for children whose parents are being deported would seem to contradict the pro-life point of view.

"
0,"It shouldn’t be surprising that Vladimir Putin would want to interfere in US politics to advance Russia’s foreign policy goals – from curtailing Nato to ending sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine and preserving Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria.  But what should surprise and disturb is that the Republican party is so vulnerable to Russian interference. The Republican party, traditionally associated with a hawkish stance toward Moscow, threw its support behind a presidential candidate who openly called on Russia to hack his opponent’s campaign.  Majority leader Mitch McConnell told Obama and leading Democrats that he would regard any effort to release evidence of Russian interference before the election as partisan. In other words, he put his own party’s interest in electing Trump ahead of the national interest.

On one hand we have the same people that took the US down the disastrous path of foreign military intervention that has resulted in today's assorted insurgents and refugees. On the other hand we have the same people that took the US down the disastrous path of NINJA mortgages and CDOs that led to economic collapse. And peppered among them are the arbitrageurs and operatives that exploited the chaos and made millions off other people's suffering.  What's not to like? What could possibly go wrong? Wow, America, great choice in picking such a public-minded, altruistic, fair-minded and ethically impeccable president elect! Things are sure going to change now. Isn't that what you wanted?

The Federal Reserve (through it's ZIRP policy and quantitative easing stimulus programs) created the """"fertile ground"""" that """"saved"""" the economy (although it didn't actually """"save"""" the economy, only goosed the stock markets and deferred the inevitable day of reckoning when interest rates must (but cannot) rise) Obama simply signed-off on the TARP bailout and the Federal Reserves unprecedented actions. He didn't come up with them. If you even followed his campaign when he was first elected, you would have known that Obama spent most of his transition time meeting with the Bush administration and following their guidance on how to address the economic crisis. He wasn't think-tanking how to fix the economy, he was being briefed on how the Fed and gov't would address the crash. He didn't make his first appointment for several weeks (way behind the pace set by Trump)

1,"I think it's pretty clear that the Comey firing is the moment that the US slides into authoritarianism. The Republicans in Congress have put party ahead of country for decades -they will do nothing to stop Trump. The Trump supporters are """"low information voters"""" who are simply abysmally ignorant -they are the exact danger that every democracy always faces -i.e., to survive as a democracy, a state needs intelligent and informed voters, a group that is seriously underrepresented in the US. Between these two, Trump has been given a free pass. Trump himself is very much like his supporters - a know-nothing who has become President and has no idea what he is doing. For the next two years, at least, he will run his country into the ground and undermine all its established norms and values.

0,"My point to prima facie is, even if the US Congress approves a treaty, we are """"subjecting"""" ourselves to another country, which is prima's complaint. No nation can just simply go it alone, and tell other countries """"you go to Hell!"""" Not even us. Yes, in a lot of ways, the Paris accord is symbolic, but it put us on record as a) acknowledging that anthropogenic global warming is real, b) that we were publicly committed to reducing carbon emissions, and, most importantly, c) by doing so, we hope other nations do the same. Trump just threw c) out the window. If anthropogenic global warming is real -- and I strongly believe it is -- then telling the world """"you all can reduce carbon emissions if you want, but we'll drill, baby, drill, and burn coal as we darn well please"""" is a great way for other countries to do the same, and we can all watch our coastal cities slowly flood as we sit and point fingers and yeall """"no, you go first!""""

The U.S. now could be dragged into another major war with Syria and their allies. I and my brother have already fought in BS republican caused wars and don't wish to see any other family deal with the crap we've been through because someone's ego overwhelms their self control.

0,"The law has to be framed in a legal manner, and many scholars seem to believe that at least portions exceed the allowable parameters and could be struck down. The simple solution would be to redraft the Executive Order to assure compliance, drop the potentially unconstitutional portions and clarify how the remainder will be applied. But that would require some flexibility, and Trump is not that kind of person. In the meantime, the ongoing uncertainty assures that the US will suffer some economic losses from lost tourism, fewer business meetings, and ultimately, cancelled conferences and seminars. People from the seven affected countries won't be able to travel, but a whole lot more people from unaffected countries will say, """"Why bother"""" with the uncertainty and potential hassles at the airport and the possibility new visa requirements will be required of all foreigners.

The phrase """"Trump's entire focus is solely himself, his concern for others is based entirely on their use and benefit to him"""" describes a typical businessman's transactional focus and is common to successful businessmen, as well leaders like Putin.  You have a personal opinion and are entitled to it.
"
0,"Hmmmm.....I'm not sure if you are admonishing me for my post or expressing another point of view.  I will assume the latter, and respond with this:  all you say is true, but it neglects several key points that are part of the bigger picture.  (1) Clinton won almost 3 million more of the popular votes than Trump; (2) the Russians wrecked havoc with the election and swung a large segment of the """"unsure"""" voters over to Trump or to not vote at all; (3) FBI Director Comey screwed the Clinton campaign with his (at best) refusal to follow department protocols re: revealing investigations and; (3) so very many who voted for Trump are in extreme regret that they did so.  Proof ?- look at the approval ratings over the past nine months.  What I mean with these facts is, do not despair!  This nation has always eventually righted the ship of state, we have always found our way to better days, and the vast majority of us have a conscience and are concerned for others.  There is much to help us thru.

Admittedly, I don't think it would change their view as admitting one got suckered is never a pleasant feeling.

0,"Trump is not against trade as is the constant accusation against him. He is against unfair trade. America has been killing its own industrial base and related jobs by shipping production to third world countries. But Americans are still  expected to buy the products back from those countries as if nothing changed.  Those armies of fry cooks, and check out clerks at Walmart could have had  better lives producing those goods if not for 50 years of unfair trade with Japan, Korea  and China. America's standard of living is falling.

In a poll taken in December 2015, the """"Gang of 8 Immigration Reform Bill"""" that passed in the Senate was favored by 85% of Democrats, 75% of Independents, and 67% of Republicans.  It failed in the House because they wanted border security first, then they'd consider it. Trump is providing the border security.  Once in place, we can give the Hispanics something the Democrats wouldn't give them: fair treatment of the illegals who came here when it was the policy of the US Government to turn a blind eye to illegal immigration, under pressure from the US Chamber of Commerce and several industries who wanted the cheap labor.  Those people came here because we wanted them to.  Since 1996, all they've needed to do to get a Taxpayer ID No. was to file a form with the SSA.  They could get a home mortgage until 2008.  Neither required proof of legal status.  And it's still a misdemeanor.

The best way to curb illegal immigration is to penalize the employers that hire them.  But then that would include the Donald himself.   Actually changing the tax code to favor American workers would mean he couldn't get his hats made in China.  He would have to deport his models.  I demand to see his wife's birth certificate.

Good luck to those nations hitching their wagon to the Chinese Express: """"America first"""" will seem like a universal declaration of human solidarity in comparison to what Beijing would have in store for the rest of the world.  Trump, for all his clumsiness, has publicly exposed the great Chinese deception: using stolen technology and intellectual property, they seek to set up a new hegemony.

No doubt that the bump - sorry, the slight decline in the rate of free fall - in his approval ratings after the cruise strike in Syria was not lost on The Orange One.  Note that he keeps demonizing Iran despite Iran's election of a """"moderate"""" (by Iranian standards) government there and the gradual move to the centre by the Rouhani administration over the last few years, particularly since the nuclear treaty.  He sees Iran as a convenient enemy, particularly as it is viewed vis-a-vis Israel.

As for the Paris Accords, I've been wondering over the last few days whether the assertions made by a number of climate advocates - all of which amount to stating that it doesn't matter what the President does so long as key States and big-business continue the trend - didn't influence Trump's decision.  In effect, he gets a huge gimme for having """"done something"""", meanwhile the US continues to contribute regardless because of the efforts of others.  Since a number of State, large city and corporate entities made their position known prior to the announcement, it ends up a win-win for Trump regardless of whether he stays in or gets out.  Obviously, there will be lots of arguments if he claims it, but the spin will be amazing to watch.

0,"""""Based on the authors examples of Trump and vaccines, the author is talking about sympathy and compassion, both of which require of us to take sides.""""  That's incorrect. There's nothing about either sympathy or compassion that requires taking a side.  The taking of sides is a strategic act, typically informed by both cognitive and emotional factors. Once a side is chosen, it tends to interfere with normal feelings of empathy and compassion. For example, when a player on the opposing team is injured, you're less likely to feel empathy for him than you would if it was a player on the team you support.  At least from a Buddhist's point of view, compassion can take no side. It's not an emotion. It's a state of being that's given freely to every living thing, without moralizing or politicizing the circumstances. Empathy on the other hand is an emotional connection between you and someone else, typically due to difficult circumstances the other is experiencing.

With an economy 1/10th the size of the United States we would be wise not to try to punch above our weight..  Trudeau wisely accepts that changing Donald Trump's views of the world is not the job of the Canadian Prime Minister.   Thankfully, many good Americans are fighting the good fight.  In the meantime, the best that we can do is contain this erratic and unstable man's worst impulses.  However, I do think its important not to throw Mexico under the bus. If asked, Mr. Trudeau should point out that a free trade area that stretches from the North Pole down to South America is a competitive advantage that America has vis a vis the giant Chinese market.

I would add that president Trump has recruited the strongest and most accomplished cabinet team since at least Reagan and probably since FDR when successful and patriotic American business and other leaders joined to do their bit in WWII.  This may be the most important thing that Trump has done so far in terms of the long term prospects of a successful presidency.  Indeed, Trump's team is so strong that it forced Little Potato to make an unprecedented and extensive shuffle and upgrade to his cabinet which had been a laughable identity politics charade and now is significantly stronger in terms of performance relevant qualifications and merit.  Come to think of it, if The Clown Prince somehow manages to get re-elected, it will be down to Trump revitalizing the US economy and forcing Junior to up his cabinet and his game.  Notwithstanding the continuing media smear jobs, it is likely the Trump Team by 2020 shall be singing We Shall Overcome (or is it We Shall Overcomb?)

No wonder Trump is gleefully celebrating the election of the old establishment Perez. I saw the debate and he was so much stronger and more confident than Perez. Perez was afraid to answer questions that would show he's still part of the old Clinton guard. Perez is another sign that the Democrats are still unwilling to admit the election loss was their fault. They blame Trump's dishonesty, the """"deplorable""""Trump supporters, the Electoral College. But they don't take responsibility for becoming irrelevant to so many who might have voted for them but didn't.

Sure, since there is a union, players have contracts but we all know that there are clauses that relate to inappropriate behavior and the NFL has its own rules regarding that as well. Right leaning people such as Curt Shilling and James Damore were fired for exercising their free speech rights. Where were these professors? Trump has focused on the patriotism aspect but, make no mistake, the right is holding the left to the left's hypocritical standard. These protestors need to be FIRED until the left supports free speech without fear of firing for EVERYONE.

0,"Connie Nuss - According to the exit polls, repeal of the ACA was the #1 issue for voters this election and the #1 reason given for voting for Donald Trump, so yeah, he owes the voters a repeal of the ACA or the GOP will lose the Senate & possibly the House in 2018 and the White House in 2020. That's where the voter enthusiasm is.  But, you're right, they shouldn't rush it. They should do it right. The AHCA was a horrible offering, nothing more than Obamacare with the individual mandate replaced with another version of individual mandate.  What they should do is look at Rand Paul's plan in the Senate, structure a House bill that looks similar and then start talking about why it would be good to go that way. Do that while the ACA continues to destabilize the insurance markets. Plan the vote for later in the year or next spring session and, viola, repeal & replacement that will drive down costs and give choice back to consumers. www.randpaul.com/news/obamacare-replacement-act-rand-paul

They will actually include some popular features of the ACA in trump care.   The public has come to accept the ACA and it is more popular than what we know so far about trump care.  If the GOP put half the effort into working with Democrats to strengthen the ACA, we would not have to go through all this drama.  But that will never happen.  The GOP won't make the numbers work without millions losing health care and making it more costly for older people.  But they will have achieved their main goal of providing aide and comfort to the wealthy.

No plan to accept a draft” - Jane Mayer’s July, 2016 interview with Schwartz (published in “The New Yorker Magazine”) is an eyeopener, for sure. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all

He clearly explained what Obamacare has cost his family .  62 million voted for Trump because they too are sick and tired of paying for slackers . With 47 percent not helping support America , yet having their hand out wanting part of what the 52 percent worked for , it should be easy to see why many of us are ticked at the lazy . No matter how much or how little someone earns EVERYONE needs to chip in something to help America . No more free loaders .

0,"[The statement did not mention the North American free-trade agreement by name] FT headline just released: [The EU and other US trading partners have begun laying the groundwork for a legal challenge to a proposed US border tax in a move that could trigger the biggest case in World Trade Organisation history.  The preliminary moves come as Republicans in Congress are working to convince President Donald Trump to back a major shake-up of the US corporate tax system that would include a new “border adjustable” system. It would see US imports subject to tax and export revenues exempted. ][...] FT.com

0,"Trump already has an agreement.  It's called NAFTA.  What he must have is a NAFTA more favorable to the United States, a market which simply dwarfs all of Canada's other trading partners.  That is a huge disadvantage for """"Canada"""" (which is too often interpreted as being synonymous with those Canadians deriving the benefits from the current system (telcos, chicken and dairy farmers, retailers, etc.)), but a potential boon for Canadian consumers.

0,"""""...it's a sign of great weakness on the part of President Trump""""  No, it's a sign of great guilt.  Trump's panicking.  The skeletons in his closet are about to come out dancing.  Felonies that he committed prior to entering office are still punishable under the law.  Trump has pretty much outlived his usefulness to Congress.  He's not helping with their legislative priorities and his daily drama is threatening them politically.  They would be thrilled to have a President Pence right now.

0,"Did Trump's election prove that his followers condoned his unsubtle racism? No more than it shows they condoned his very unsubtle sexism. Trump offered an endless menu of improbable things most voters didn't like. However most thought they were offered at least one thing they really, really wanted which had never been on offer before.  I talked to religious guy in North Carolina who hated almost everything about Trump but voted for him because """"he will end abortion"""". I read that women who despise him voted for him because they think he will control immigration. He won because he promised almost everybody at least one change they really care about that the elites won't even talk about and so they swallowed the rest of the sleazy package. The irony is most will not get what they wanted but they will get the nasty bits including racism.

0,"This article is a classic example out of the mainstream media's PSYOP manual, complete with false narrative. It continues to push the constant stream of manufactured headlines attacking Trump, while ignoring the volumes of severely damaging documents being released daily about their candidate and their party via the FBI, WikiLeaks and elsewhere.  The PYSOP continues as  their chosen candidate is given the appearance of outpacing the more popular rival, even though the public knows it is false. Manipulated polls pushed through the media then feed and exploit their narrative construct.  They are treating the story as if the election of Clinton as a forgone conclusion, before a single vote is cast.  Fortunately for America, it's not working. Trump, after the third debate, is now leading in all national polls, even the liberal medias own fraud is becoming impossible to manipulate any further.  The most damaging content yet (against the complicit mainstream media) has yet to be released.

Over the years, I have heard some so called Alpha types say many things very similar to what Trump said. With that being said, Bill Clinton has been accused by many women of doing exactly the things Trump talked about. Credible accusations and Hillary undertook an active campaign to destroy the women who made these accusations. Just because someone says something does not mean they have done it. Again, there is no credible accusation from anyone that Trump did anything resembling what he talked about. Thank you for being so reasonable and respectful in your comments.

As we await SCOTUS to review this, if they chose to, the issue of the president's actions being reviewable by the courts will continue to plague his signing more EOs that the courts may be reviewing.

What you are doing is discrediting the source which is a logical fallacy that sadly, too many people fall for.  The question here isn't Snowden and his past.  Whether you or agree or disagree with his past actions is quite irrelevant to point that he (and pretty much everyone else) is making on this one.  The Trump campaign is under investigation by the FBI and is led by Comey.  Trump dismissed the head of the FBI.  Even if this was due to the Clinton email issue (which is belied by the termination letter which allegedly was all about Russia), then the timing is atrocious and the optics are terrible.  We are once again left with two options:  Trump is either a totalitarian or incompetent.  Pick your poison.  BTW, I agree that Comey had to go.  Just not right now.

I'll just ask you, do you really want a president who is """"raunchy, vulgar, lewd, tasteless, horny, seductive, inappropriate""""?  A Tom Jones song doesn't justify Trump's comments or a Trump presidency.  Just because Trump doesn't do drugs or drink is no reason to vote for him.

0,"Very good column. The NYT didn't so much approve of Trump's action as not denounce it apoplectically, as it usually does with respect to Trump, which  amounts to a kind of grudging approval in today's hyper partisan American political forum. It raised two issues about the legality of  Trump's action and urged Trump to seek to make his actions legal in the future.  One was the lack of congressional approval in accord with the constitution----sounding like Republicans a few years ago----while noting briefly that their own guy (Obama) didn't much bother with this. The other was the lack of UN Security Council approval, without mentioning that this was  impossible thanks to the Security Council veto and the Putin/Xi  doctrine that dictators who are clients of Security Council members should be free to do what they want to their own people without international interference, apart perhaps from a little hacking.

1,"Mr Rubinsteins question was a sensible one?  Not in this lifetime Gary...Trump has shown for the last 40 years just how much better he understands our history and the structure and function of our government. Did you think he just took the Capital Directory and threw darts at it to decide who's campaign he needed to grease in in order to get what he wanted ? He has a much better grasp on our history than anyone on the left because he understands when America was at its greatest and why. An ideal that with all of the books written on the topic your team still doesn't get it. Here's a hint ... it wasn't because of unrestricted illegal immigration, abortions on demand,  or allowing the rest of the world to treat the US like their Bit$%. The regrettable lack of understanding is all yours Gary ...you and Rubinstein, and it does denigrate you as well. This must be what smart sounds like to stupid people.  Another thing Trump figured out early ...Democrats are cheap and easy to buy
"
0,"Here's two unproven claims. Obama: the Russians hacked the US electoral process. Trump: 3 million illegal ballots by immigrants cost me the popular vote. Despite the fact that not a shred of proof of either claim has been offered, many people accept the former as gospel while scoffing at the latter. But is Trump's claim truly incredible?  There are approximately 11 million immigrants  in the US illegally today. There are a further 22 million lawful immigrants in the US who are not yet qualified to vote. That totals 33 million immigrants who, if they voted, did so illegally. Trump is claiming that perhaps 1 in 10 of those immigrants managed to vote against him, due to his tough stand on immigration, etc.  If you're willing to believe- without any proof- that the Russians hacked the US electoral process, then why would you refuse to believe that a small percentage of US immigrants managed to cast an illegal ballot?
"
0,"Removing a statue that has been deemed offensive by a majority of the community or their representatives does NOT re-write or erase history as some, like Trump, seem to simplistically claim. Our public sites of honour should not be occupied by monuments that the majority feel do not reflect values that a community honours. One would hope we have better things to put in their place.  The removal of a statue of a Confederate general in this case is PART of history and does not create instant mass amnesia about what the Civil War was fought over nor that general's role in it. Nobody is advocating that history textbooks be burned or re-written, for god's sake.  Similarily, the removal of Nazi emblems and statues in Germany has not rendered the evil of Hitler or the Holocaust forgotten nor has the removal of Lenin's statue in countless former East Bloc towns and cities caused the obliteration of the history of the Soviet Union.

No matter how many hands one shakes one can't shake off that way corruption. Even though I have not illusions about many other things about Trump who's using week spots of corrupted elites to enthrone himself as a dictator: He possibly wants to create a Union of Dictators (which explains in part his liking for Putin) in which he would be a Principal Dictator.

They have always gone about policies through a system of checks and balances, debating with Congress and amending proposed laws as required in order to have them pass through the Senate and House of Representatives. Obama did use executive orders, yes, but what he did not do was completely overhaul the government through intimidation and force in order to impose his power and will. He always did so while working with others and listening to opposing views.  Trump is not the Republican Party. Trump is Trump and a burgeoning dictator. He wants a sense of power unlike any other President and has already shown that he will take drastic steps against those who oppose his view. This is a scary and unprecedented situation the United States finds itself in, and what needs to be looked at are the policies being put in place. They are horrendous policies, and to be ignored speaks to how disillusioned you must be.

Pundits seem to not want to look beyond the last one or two election cycles, but were they to analyze the long trend, across the last 30 years, they would see a pattern that is clear to me, at least: The electorate is increasingly rejecting what they see as the status quo and are ever venturing further afield to vote for those they see as anti-establishment. Outsiders, Mavericks, Third Party candidates, Hope and Change, going back at least to Ross Perot's attempted run.  And what happens? They turn out to be largely no different than their predecessors, the electorate is even more disenfranchised, frustrated and upset that they vote for someone even more fringe, only to be let down again.

Take Trump's handling of the transgenders in the military thing last week. If he had just had the Pentagon make the announcement, as is customary,  it would have been a one-day story. Instead, he crassly tweeted the announcement (who announces policy by way of social media?) without first consulting his military advisers, and needlessly turned what could have been an arguably rational policy decision into a major process blunder.  That's just one in a long list of examples. Jeff Sessions. The Boy Scouts. The Priebus/Scaramucci feud. None of these things had to happen and they are all symptomatic of a president who doesn't understand the importance of temperance and nuance in politics.  As long as Trump insists on making himself the story, this is how it's going to be. And that isn't the fault of the press. It's squarely on him.

This thread is hilarious: Trump is like John Adams, Trump is like FDR, Obama was just as bad! If you ignore Trump's rank ignorance of government, history, political philosophy, his utter lack of intellectual curiosity, and the fact that his entire presidency appears to be a vendetta against his predecessor, sure, there's not all that much difference between them.

0,"Based on the dozens of definitions of """"populism"""" both candidates in the French presidential elections were """"populists.""""  Le Pen is referred to as such because of the negative meaning that has been assigned to the """"populist"""" label worldwide, and her stepping out of the politically correct straitjacket gave her a  pariah status especially in the so-called """"liberal"""" media.  Macron, on the other hand, who campaigned against the establishment, with no party behind him, only a movement, is very much like Trump. And if Trump is called a 'populist', then Macron has to be as well.  What is  common in Le Pen and Macron, is that both are outsiders, both are attacking the establishment and both enjoy wide popular support.  Isn't it this what those """"good"""" and """"non-populist"""" politicians always dream about and would do almost anything under the sun to get it?  But when someone else gets it and not them ... well.... they just """"populists"""". :))

Justin Beiber would have had a hard time keeping up to the 70 year old Trump. Every stadium, conventions hall, sports arena, and gymnasium was filled to over flowing.

His honest-to-God true character is just too weak & too narcissistic for him to be able to do that.

Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country. Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians. They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything. Pot calling the kettle black for sure. The manipulation and hypocrisy coming from the democrats is mind boggling to say the least. But we must understand they are drinking a kool aid that distorts the mind. Its called free lovism and situational ethics. Hail Hillary!!!!

When Anchorage set a record for the number of people shot at one time in downtown , which was clearly a front page headline story , it appeared in the B section . Instead , because they don't like Sarah Palin , they made the stupid party fist fight where no one got hurt the front page story. The Dispatch hated Trump so much nearly every day of the week they published front page  stories trashing Trump. They made a big deal and fake story about how the election may be taken away from Trump by the electoral college , yet the day after that fake story was exposed , they listed a one inch announcement Trump had won that too .  If the Dispatch doesn't like someone or has a position on an issue , they use the news pages to push it , when those opinions should appear on the editorial page . Sadly , the Dispatch is all we've got .

1,"Paul Waldman had an excellent piece in the WaPo today on this:  Why Trump’s tweets matter: They shed light on how he’d behave as president  On the simplest level, we know why Trump does this: He believes firmly that whenever anyone criticizes him, he simply must attack them back. As he wrote in his 2007 book “Think Big and Kick Ass”:  “When someone crosses you, my advice is ‘Get Even!’…  Let’s not forget that there is literally no one on Earth who gets more criticism from more people than the president of the United States. How is Trump going to handle that daily deluge of disrespect? What effect will it have on his ability to think clearly, particularly in times of stress and crisis?  Indeed, given what we’ve seen in the campaign it’s hard to imagine Trump ever being capable of carrying out a strategy that required from him any measure of emotional control. The contrast with Hillary Clinton couldn’t be more stark.

And neither do REAL men, even though bully boys attempt to justify such conduct among their own, even in the Catholic church!

Everyone advocating more spending on military in US is ultimately looking into braking financial back of US and nothing good can come out of it. They are already spending on military like drunken sailor, with very minimal benefits and ultimately that complex will have their wars to justify that kind of spending and to try their toys. Actually any increase in debt of US is not sustainable and will lead only to troubles for many.

Consider also the roles of Obama and Clinton in their illegal regime change in Libya and their similar attempts in Syria which resulted in millions of Muslim being uprooted as refugees flooding into Europe ,while in Ukraine they even over threw a democratically elected Govt just because they favored Russia.

Kennedy would be replaced by someone equally muddle-headed. The two women would have been replaced not just by women but by women with at least some leftist tilt.  That other Republican would have fretted that, if he did otherwise, the NY Times would attack him. As a result we'd be likely to get justices who """"grow"""" in office much like Souter and Kennedy. Matters in this country would have gone from bad to worse. We'd have polygamy and, just to be egalitarian, polyandry. Marriage, already in a dismal state, would grow even worse. More kids would grow up in fatherless homes while liberals gloat the some kids have two mommies.  On the other hand, if Trump is able to appoint young and solidly conservative justices, we won't be troubled from that angle for quite a few years.

Also, if you are concerned with Russian influence, than you should be concerned how Obama and Hillary colluded with them.  Otherwise, how are you going to stop it in the future?   This info is also readily available.   Also, the more we go on, the more you find that Trump and his inner circle were not cooperating with the Russians.  Trump did not agree to any meetings with russians.

1,"Anyone that truly loves this country must by now understand that Trump is a bubble off plume and must go. We are now the laughing stock of the entire world. If appointed by Trump, we must reject. The office of POTUS is not like running a business, and Trump doesn't have close to what it takes to be the president. He lied to all, and some couldn't see through the bs he was handing out, I really hope that if you voted for this idiot your happy and like vodka.

0,"This is some major-league shifting of goalposts.  What Donald Trump said last night:  """"In the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby right out of the womb, just prior to the birth of the baby.""""  Purg already noted: such a procedure is known as a """"Caesarean section."""" As Hillary said, any woman who chooses to abort in the 9th month almost exclusively does so for urgent medical reasons.  Your sources concern abortions after 20 weeks, NOT """"in the ninth month.""""  The majority of abortions are performed on low-income women, so it's no surprise the majority of late abortions are performed on low-income women. Reducing the number of abortions means reducing poverty. And we all know the Republican solution to reducing poverty: more redistribution of wealth to the wealthy.

No mention of the cost and the U.S.'s billions in contributions, yet countries like China (you know, the one we have a trade deficit with), pay nothing. Are you """"OK"""" with that?  So, Trump probably feels that if he doesn't """"tweet"""", the MSM  will dominate the discussion, labeling the withdrawal as the worst thing ever.  When the media dominates as it does, it makes it very difficult for Trump to govern, which is the whole point.  And by the way, I'm not a Republican.  Also, Trump is a Democrat/ Republican hybrid. A large part of the Republican establishment  cannot stand him .  He was elected because people are sick of politicians, from both parties.

The 2 bigger fish yesterday have been charged with activities having nothing whatsoever to do with Trump or the election campaign or the post campaign presidency which took place years before Manafort's brief time with the Trump campaign.  The 3rd person charged pleaded guilty of lying to the FBI about contacting Russians and was a minor operative at the fringes of the campaign.

His partnership with Steve Bannon -- a white supremacist, anti-Semite, and anarchist -- promises to be a real force for evil in the post-election period.

Now there are so many messages being protested during the National Anthem, so much so that NONE of the messages (and certainly not Kap's original message) are getting into the minds of as many people as these players had hoped.  Now that Trump is involved the protests are going to be about hating Trump - so much for Kap's police brutality protest message.  Again, sure, go ahead and use your God-given right to protest during the National Anthem as long as you realize your message is not going to get the focus you want it to get.

Better to investigate why the former president, Obama, and his people kept this """"secret"""" for a number of months, not a month, that people were trying to disrupt the election, Could it be that Obama and Company expected Hillary to win the election therefore did NOT want her victory questioned ?

Burke is an increasingly isolated figure, & I don't see him pulling Douthat, etc. to his side on Trump. To a person, all of them have denounced both Trump generally & the Muslim ban.

1,"I've read numerous articles by Elise Patkotak and I am confounded at how she ends up on the stupid side of every issue. Bewildering. Her bizarre fixation of the US turning into Nazi Germany goes way beyond political rhetoric and sinks into cognitive disfunction. Perhaps a more HONEST reading of history would demonstrate to her that it is exactly these disappointed Bernie/Hillary supporters that are making this leap of logic and are the ones mimicking kristallnacht by rioting, blocking traffic and attacking Trump supporters while calling for the rape of Melania Trump. Perhaps Elise would like to see Trump supporters marked with a yellow T so that they can be easily identified. Let me save you the trouble. Trump supporters are HALF of the United States that are tired of corruption, a dishonest media, of having radical ideas shoved down our throats. Perhaps Elise hasn't really been paying attention. This isn't about a new order, it's about returning to order. Make America great AGAIN!

0,"People are feeling disenfranchised by both political parties. Big money interests have purchased politicians in both parties so that no matter which party is in power, they still win. The rise of Sanders and Trump are testament to the frustration of the American people to the status quo. Sanders represents the desire to return to the progressive policies of presidents beginning w FDR that made this the country the envy of the world. Sadly, this country started turning it's back on populist policies in favor of corporatism beginning w the Carter administration. Unfortunately, the Trump candidacy is channeling this same frustration into baser human emotions of hate and prejudice. There can be no hope for this country as long as we have a stranglehold on our political process by the two party system controlled by corporate interests. The current system of closed primaries and presidential debates is designed to prevent the rise of new parties responsive to the will of the people.

The lack of state action is critical to its decision.  There's a pretty fundamental difference between a political party saying """"we won't put you on the ballot unless you promise to vote a certain way"""" and a state government saying """"we're going to engage in criminal prosecution if you don't vote a certain way.""""

0,"Many have asked why did devout, practicing Catholics vote for Trump. First of all, I have never voted for a Democrat in my entire life. Born and raised a Republican and would not vote any differently. Secondly, I was a Jeb Bush supporter, and he lost. Trump was my only candidate. I would never have voted for Clinton. Was not even part of the thinking process.  Now, how do I reconcile that decision with my Catholic faith. I don't because the church is not monolithic. Any of us, whether Republican or Democrat, can twist and turn our partisan politics in any religious direction to justify our vote. I did not vote for Trump because of my faith; I did so because I am a conservative. Hilary was not.  I think that it is disingenuous to assume that good Catholics wear their religion on their sleeves when they vote. They don't. No one takes the faithful citizenship booklet to the voting booth; they hardly read it. Instead, we vote according to how we were raised and how we currently think.

1,"So, it was okay when Obama's TSA sexually-molested us at the airport, but it's not okay when Trump's TSA sexually-molests us at the airport?  Here is the real issue. It's not okay for TSA to sexually molest us no matter who is president! Ever!  Plenty of people protested when the Obama TSA started this practice (along with the nude photos), but back then, people like Petula poo-poo'd our concerns because their beloved El Presidente would never order something that was humiliating to mentally """"balanced"""" people. He had to keep us """"safe"""", so we were expected to """"suck it up"""" and not protest the sexual molestation.  But now that it's a president they disagree with ... slam on the brakes, we can't have that. Suddenly it becomes sexual molestation and we've got to make it stop.  Well, we've been sliding down that slippery slope since 2010 (October, btw). Maybe if you'd joined us in 2010 we'd have some chance of actually winning the battle, but now ... it's kind of late.

I don't buy it. . The Left well knows the power of a name. That's why the Left insists that groups it likes be referred to in the way the group wants but that groups they don't like must be referred to in the way the Left wants. . I notice that the claims about the Alt-Right don't seem to include being anti-gay anymore.

Canada loses the best home grown advance in aeronautics since the Avro Arrow, France picks up a huge piece of technology for a song, and Alabama gets the jobs Trump promised. A win all around you might say - except for Canadian taxpayers.  It's dirty pool and fair to say Trudeau was snookered. And yet faced with one of the worst cases of U.S. economic thuggery in decades, it would have taken real nerve and great smarts to avoid this outcome. It didn't help of course that Bombardier itself is a badly run company that abused its shareholders and gouged the federal and Quebec governments.

Trump himself passed along his thanks to the Russian trolls.  https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bS3BPMpPUKI/Wef0tBZ1rWI/AAAAAAAA0DU/qP9Vf17yvao_upBXh8qM76Bnki2t_t8XgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B2017-10-18%2Bat%2B5.40.30%2BPM.png

Russia has been trying to get that acknowledgment for many, many years and Trump just handed it to him.

0,"I think that Putin and Trump will be even better buddies going forward. No one actually cares about Syria or its people. If a few thousand or a few million of them die, it just doesn't matter in the whole scheme of things. Syria has few resources and is of no importance, except that Russia would like to maintain its naval base in the Mediterranean. Russia is just trying to carve out a little patch of friendly territory, while Trump gets stuck doing Europe's dirty work for them cleaning out ISIS. I expect that Trump and Putin will get together in the near future, wonder why every other country is so useless, and slam down a few vodkas. Putin only respects strength, which is why he always kicked sand in Obama's face. I think Putin will make a special effort to be friendly with Trump, because Trump is a little less predictable and is not afraid to send 50 missiles to make his point.

0,"The economic relationship that has developed within NAFTA has been one of mutual advantage. It has evolved as a free competitive market and bears all the hallmarks of efficiency that Adam Smith would expect. Nobody has been coerced, so deals have been made only when both parties benefit.  Often in economics we discuss efficiency, and as a counterpoint we bring up the notion of equity, or fairness. Efficiency and fairness are two separate outcomes, and you rarely get one without sacrificing the other.  If Trump wants fairness (whatever that means!), he's going to have to sacrifice efficiency, which will reduce the wealth and well-being of all the NAFTA trading partners. Trump (among others) needs to understand more of economics. When the government interferes in markets and distorts prices, there are very seldom good outcomes, and never efficient ones . Also, what makes sense in profit oriented business in the micro scale tends to have disastrous consequences in the macro economy.

Democrats are now complaining that Wisconsin election officials did something unfair, something racist.  Again, the BS cry of racist.  Had it been racist, the Court would not have allowed it.  So, in answer to your question, it was the Wisconsin election officials who LEGALLY changed the rules to protect the integrity of the ballot and prevent voter fraud.  That goes to the heart of the election process.  To say that Trump won the election because Republicans """"purged"""" the rolls of legal voters is the most desperate and ridiculous thing I've ever seen on this blog.  The fact that Democrats claim 200,000 voters in their column who could not even prove their identity says a lot about their care for the integrity of the ballot box.

It was just Trump doing what he's done countless times before.  He sees something or hears something and tweets the same thing as if he came up with it.  There's no 'there' there.  It's Trump.

Hard to get blood from a turnip as they say.     And consider you can be sure the United States is profiting in some way from their admittance to the union, open markets, cheap labor, a buffer zone for defense.  We'd rather use their territory for a war and not our own.  Past administrations are not as stupid as President Trump would imply (we know he exaggerates for effect and persuasion), and NATO has a long dynamic history.  A contract of shared interest, should contain mutual benefits and the defense spending is only part of the equation.   IMO  There are probably arguments to protect, or sacrifice these small economy nations to Russia.    Maybe it would be good to ask THEM which they prefer!   ;-)

The Allies are very close to a military strike against NK because sanctions and diplomacy have not slowed Kim's nuclear proliferation and missile programs.  Haley said that the US will not even bother to call a meeting of the Security Council because even if more sanctions were agreed, members, especially China, Russia, and Iran, would not enforce them.  Trump tweeted quite clearly:  """"We will not allow this to continue...""""  If the US must use force to stop Kim from getting a nuclear ICBM, then it's likely that there will be millions of Asian casualties which will precipitate WW III because Russia & China will not stand idly by.

Sater worked for Trump and despite emails, photos and the foreclosed, litigation ridden Trump Soho deal, Trump says he does not know him. Cohen says he had nothing to do with Russia-- and look. Trump and his family are being investigated for trying to conceal Sater's involvement in Trump Soho which is a fraud on other investors and the banks involved. These types of deals with underworld figures tied to Putin open Trump to being enticed into participating in money laundering (he settled one case for $10 Million) and fraud and resulting blackmail-- a Russian mob technique-- do favor now, ask for one later.

Maybe 100 of these globally.  ALL ARE NOW RESOURCE-BASED.  Canada is the economy scoring 100/100 in these respects.  The USA is deeply in deficit.

Trump understood the political pulse and eviscerated the Democratic Party's exposed jugular vein.  6 months into the Administration and the results are sparse. The Congress can't agree on whether they like their own parents. The POTUS continues to reveal his penchant for self-promotion over ad hoc political alliances. The net result has been positive. The ACA won't be overturned. It will financially implode in many locales but we all knew that. Tax reform was last made in 1986. There's slim hope of changes to the antiquated tax code.

Dennis Kucinich, whom many in Hawaii respect, """"The Democratic Party Platform  drafting committee, in two days has taken a wrecking ball to the U.S. constitution, the global climate and World Peacr, TPP, ISRAEL/ Palestine, and fracking. TPP destroys three articles of the U.S. constitution. It does so by transferring the sovereign powere to an snti-,democratic investor state and to International Tribunals run by private attorneys."""" OBAMA recently endorsed Hillary Clinton. Remember Bill Clinton did great harm to the middle class and Americam workers with NAFTA., which I believe that Sen. Bob Dole, etc. Supported.

0,"Nice anti Trump column and totally wrong. The fear matches the propoganda, but the memo by Trump on hiring more agents was essentially about the budget cycle. It had nothing to do with the latest round of arrests and deportations, which largely targeted aliens with criminal offenses who have not yet been deported, but who knew deportation was certain. This enhanced attention started under President Obama. It has been going on for a while now. Obama may have let Dreamers off the hook, but that simly allowed greater attention to those who should be deported.  Of course, the question is whether enhanced deportation is targeting dangerous criminals or DUI offenders (which are dangerous, but not violent if they don’t drink and drive). There was already fear in the immigrant community because of the Obama initiative. The current cycle is simply a continuation of that.

0,"Bravo Hugh!   You said it. Trump, with his cabinet of billionaires, Wall-Streeters and generals is the furthest thing from a true Populist. The Populist party of Oregon, formed in 1892, sought to  use government to control the monopoly power of the railroads and other big industries; they evolved in to the Oregon Progressives under William U'ren who developed the """"Oregon System"""" of initiative, referendum and recall. Trump, on the other hand, would strip away the Peoples' Power to control business excesses through employing  the power  of our democratic government.  But rather than just complaining, Progressives need to create  programs that really would give working Americans a fair share of the nation's wealth and power while protecting the environment and our democratic society..

The Chinese have said they are interested in US infrastructure projects (and they are in the process of cutting deals now)-- with Chinese ownership of land at Kapolei and Ko'olina-- they might be interested. We sell or finance the project at a discount and get it done. Bank of Hawaii and First Hawaiian have expressed interest in financing the rail on this basis, so get them involved.

But countries who did same in response to such an illegal ban is in fact legal.  He will discover that imposing 20% blanket tariff is illegal under both WTO and NAFTA and will be struck down by the court. But the exact retaliation is legal.  And now I come to the real reason why Trump is in such a hurry to ban from the 7 countries. The Obama administration have bombed the 7 countries resulting in 25,000 deaths according to independent observers. The CIA estimated that there are now enough anger for them to stage another 9/11 and have detected signs. It urge Trump to blanket ban travels to check any such plans.

0,"So far, how do you think Trump is doing in a rapprochement with Xi Jinping? Not so well, I would say. Trump, so far, has thrown away leverage along with the TPP. Xi will strike like a cobra, eating our trade with SE Asia. Why do this? I think Trump has done this for purely political reasons, and I hear he has gone against the will of Paul Ryan, the most powerful Republican in office behind the president. What's to negotiate? Trump has said he would put a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. The US is China's biggest market. Probably Trump thinks he can get some concessions through blackmail. Maybe that would work, maybe not. A 50% VAT on Chinese products would hurt US consumers and kill Apple. This sounds nuts.

O yea, it also includes........ virtually all of humanity.   We behave by nature in our self-interest, justifying our behavior by our need to survive, figuratively or literally.  The real hypocricy is with those who claim that they do not lie, do not break trust, do not make claims about their identity,   Heck one of those alone takes out 95% of the writers on this site with fake identities.      It's not malicious, it isn't terrible, but it most certainly is hypocricy under Runciman's definition.

And that would not only destroy his political career but at the same time his business. All Trump brand would be tarnished. So, in essence this POTUS with very questionable ethics and mental stability decided to cave in to the """"deep state"""" requirements, betray base that elected him and become one more POTUS that is hostage to his handlers. The thing is that most of us would also do the same since the """"deep state"""" is far more powerful than him.

Biden's floor speech was on June 25, 1992, more than three months later in the election cycle.  There was no Supreme Court vacancy to fill.  There was no nominee to consider.  The Senate never took a vote to adopt a rule to delay consideration of a nominee until after the election (hence there is no Biden rule).  He didn't argue for a delay until the next president began his term, as McConnell actually did. He said the nomination process should be put off until after the election, which was on Nov. 3, 1992.  Oh, and just to keep up, we Americans are going to have to pay for the wall, Trump has no replacement for Obamacare, Trump is using an unsecured phone, and not just giving speeches to Goldman Sachs people, he is putting them in charge.

He is not Pat Robertson or even Pat Buchanan, both social conservatives and failed presidential candidates. And it looks like Trump is not even a fiscal conservative, but actually a big spender.  He even called himself """"the king of debt"""".

Even that said, I'll throw the BS flag on your claims. Economic growth, the ultimate measure of our economy, NEVER hit these levels once with Obama in 8 years and then dropped precipitously. Border crossings and IsIs. Obama was asleep at the wheel. Shoot, we wouldn't even have a damn ISIS if Obama hadn't considered them the JV.

Add to those the '17 USA intel agencies agree report' claim that turned out to be a fabricated propaganda myth, with no '17 agencies agree' report having ever existed. . Add to all those the largely-discredited report put together by 2-dozen hand-picked individuals from 3 USA agencies which concluded """"high confidence"""", while also explicitly stating underneath its """"high confidence"""" label that """"high confidence"""" doesn't indicate it is fact or certainty. .

0,"Trump could admit to SEC and FEC violations and accept censure and likely serve out his term, but he won’t get a second and Pence is too extreme on the non-issues of gay marriage and abortion. Any Democrat who acknowledges that wins. Will it be a neo-liberal or an anti-Trump who goes after capitalism? Is it ageist to say Sanders is too old? Is his midwestern protege, Eliason, too Muslim? Rachel Maddow watchers have been seeing a lot of Adam Schiff lately. He has been the Democratic face of the investigation He won’t be made Speaker but he might be an interesting President.  If the GOP splits into an alt-right party and a neo-liberal party, the Dems might move into a radical party and join the GOP neo-libs. Given the last primaries, I am not sure who would win that. It depends upon the candidates.

The president was flying around on the public's dime using the prestige of the world's highest and most powerful office to stump for Hillary. Having the president walk in with the band playing Pomp and Circumstance and taking the podium to say you were the one was not intended to influence voters? I remind you the Russians leaked what was in the emails, not make up lies. Who is stupid enough in this day and age to put incriminating information in a email? A tight ship does not leak. I am not naive enough to believe any one in this contest had clean hands. Hillary lost because she would have been a Obama clone and people were fed up with him. So far 2 people that said they posted fake news were the ones that got Trump elected. I don't see anyone attacking them. They are the 2 most important people ali

Fast forward to today :  Trump said it best on how every four years the democrats tell blacks they have their backs---then disappear until the next election.  Trump repeatedly mentioned how he planned to fix the inner cities---the greatest death trap for minorities. Under Obama black unemployment rose and thousands died in the inner cities across America . If Trump keeps his promise to work on fixing the inner cities , republicans will start getting the black vote they have long deserved .

0,"No, the tax system is overly complex, which creates loopholes and tax reduction strategies.  If you think the tax system is rigged, you can thank career politicians like Hillary for doing so.  But go ahead and go down the road of thinking the tax system is rigged by Trump. Elect Hillary and see what she does for you. Her tax plan includes a plan to tax 401(k)s. It is a back door tax on middle America that very few people see coming. She is the first person to try and go after the honey bucket known as retirement savings. But you knew that since you are so educated on taxes.  I'm not saying I like Trump. I just see him as the lesser of two evils. Hillary is a career politicians, interested in her own agenda, and purchased by the lobbyist. Trump has his own agenda, but his own agenda deals with bringing money home to the USA, which makes him more money.

I wouldn't have any concerns about being a subcontractor for Trump.  Hillary is as crooked as they come. She is a career politician out for herself and her lobbyist. She will screw over anyone except the highest bidder. I'd rather roll the dice with Trump than with Hillary any day.

Bush 43 was not much more competent than JEB.  His handling of 9/11 and the initial foray into Afghanistan was excellent.  But his selection of fools like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz, his attempt a nation building in Afghanistan, his ill-advised invasion of Iraq, and his policies that led to an economic meltdown demonstrated that he really was not capable Presidential leadership.  Worst of all he directly contributed to the election of obama.  The Republican Party has given the Bush family great gifts over the years.  If they could not support a Republican President, they could at least remain silent.  Perhaps Trump's greatest contribution to American politics in the 2016 election was his destruction of both the Bush Dynasty and the Clinton Crime Family.

The pill has been used and prescribed long enough to have determined its safety and effectiveness for the public. Prescriptions require costly routine visits to the doctors' offices.

Even so, there are reports that the Russian government is looking at the incoming Trump presidency with growing alarm over his erratic nature.

With the """"news"""" monopoly pushing forward only a hard left ideology and omitting or burying anything not supporting those positions when people learn the """"whole story"""" this is what happens. Unfortunately most people I find on the left quickly overcome the cognitive dissonance by entrenching themselves in their own position and calling others derogatory names.

0,"Kendzior writes of “Trump’s lie that millions of citizens voted illegally”, in similar terms to Rachel Maddow and other professional Trump haters. The imprecision of their denial is deliberate. Even 1,499,999 illegal voters would round down to one million, which is not millions of illegal voters. Most people would consider such a large number of illegal voters an outrage, and would more than justify some of the kinds of protections that Kendzior dismisses as “voter suppression”. Elections expert Alan Richman estimated that 1.3 million non-citizens voted illegally in the 2016 election: https://fs.wp.odu.edu/jrichman/2016/11/28/is-it-plausible-that-non-citizen-votes-account-for-the-entire-margin-of-trumps-popular-vote-loss-to-clinton/ Richman extrapolated the same 6.4 percentage of non-citizens voting illegally in 2012, when inoffensive Romney was the Republican candidate, and in 2016, when immigrants were told that Trump was for them what Hitler was for the Jews

Could it be because their own scientist/whistleblower Dr. Thompson has admitted to falsifying and trashing data in their 2004 study that links the MMR to Autism? Could it be that when the Vaccine Act of 1986 was passed giving vaccine manufacturers immunity from prosecution, parents of vaccine injured children were left to grovel in the special kangaroo court that takes an average of 8 years to go through? The same court has awarded almost $4billion  for injuries ranging from Seizure Disorders, Death and yes, even Autism-Hannah Poling to name just one.

And theyhave clean records and  pay taxes-- they are registered with government and pay as resident aliens that the government can track. The biggest groups lobbying for them ate the businesses that employ them. The idea is not to give them citizenship, but to allow them stay without being deported and earn at least resident status.

If he'd been, say, Slovenian, the level of suspicion concerning his citizenship would have been the same. Of course, Melania was Slovenian, and her name comes from the Greek μελαινα, which means black, or to the medically inclined (as 'melaena'), 'black stool resulting from an upper GI bleed'.  So if Trump were a racist, would he marry someone whose name means 'black'?  That's civil marriage, of course, because it was his third. Anyway, getting back to football, this afternoon I watched the local second XV take on Tunbridge Wells.  None of this ridiculous overspecialisation of American football--offence, defence, special teams--and no Darth Vader suits either.  Just a bunch of sweaty men jumping on top of each other.

Immelt recently moved thousands of GE jobs to China  figuring that the Paris Agreement would hobble the U.S. big time and countries like China would cash in because THEY wouldn't have to abide by all the industrial restraints the U.S. (and Canada) would be subject to.  Ditto for Microsoft.  Trump was doing what he took an oath to do; defend and protect the United States of America.  Signing on to the PA would have meant giving up the country's sovereignty to some faceless Eurogovernment bureaucrats.  As the U.S. Fed lowers taxes, allows industries (including King Coal) and ordinary Americans to prosper and grow as it gets out of their way Canada will be forced to either do likewise or go the way of banana dictatorships like Venezuela.

A man as egocentric as Trump surrounds himself with sycophants....I might use the term """"#@$kissers"""".  It's not unusual, most politicians, entertainers and athletes have them hovering around them.  Billie Bush was, in my opinion, an """"$#@#kissing punk"""".  A man like Trump needs the validation of such people to bolster his self-concept.  If the people around him would, instead, confront, him about his obscene, boorish behavior, perhaps he'd change.

Lastly, if the D's keep up Trump, they will get a real conservative Christian who will take many things away the D's hold so dearly such as roe vs wade.  On the flip side Trump cannot be impeached until after the midterms as the D's dont have anywhere close to the votes and Ryan would never bring it to up for debate.

He'll have both a Democrat challenger and many many Republican challengers.  The people who elected Donald Trump are not cultists of personality like people from the left.   To the contrary,  the people from the right are team players.  Ground swell.  Thus the right took over State Legislatures, Governors of 30 States, the House, the Senate, the executive, and will appoint the next Justice to the Supreme Court.

And Trump's reaction to terrorism was to cut anti-terrorism budgets to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires. Back of the line, Lars, you failed miserably again.

Instead , women take it as the easy choice of convenience because they weren't strong enough to say NO if they didn't have birth control on hand. And liberal women shine them on and encourage all they're sisters to get abortions. Isn't it odd that they claim to want to control they're bodies , yet do such a terrible job of doing it ? 1400 abortions last year in Alaska are proof positive of what a terrible job they are doing.  Instead of marching against everything Trump suggests , they out to be out buying birth control for all the women who need it. Doing that , would make a difference .

Consider, for instance, the hideous inauguration address and Bannon's successful ploy in getting himself appointed to the National Security Council. Then, in the wake of the Flynn debacle and Bannon's removal from the NSC (at the behest, no doubt, of Gen. McMaster), Bannon's star seemed to recede as Jared/Ivanka assumed the role of de facto president. Now, as Jared's Russia problem percolates, Bannon seems to be resuming his place in Trump's head and in his ear. Is Trump """"mad"""" in the way King George was? I don't know.

Violence against non-African-Americans is perfectly fine for the five. Yet that reflects the viewpoint of UNM? It does when the message is hijacked by 5 over tens of thousands of students and alums.

Similar to Trump's recent attempts to thwart an investigation into Russia's influence over the recent presidential election.  China has FULL control over its currency 'onshore' and 'offshore'. Look up China's program for 'Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors' (QFIIs).

RELATED: Matt Lauer pitches Trump a ridiculous softball: ‘Will you be prepared on day one?’ Clinton supporters online accused Lauer of not only revisiting questions that weren’t germane to the forum, but repeatedly interrupting her while doing so  The only problem about this forum is that there was not enough time for Matt Lauer to speak. Kept interrupting Hillary while she was answering his questions.  """"Trump vowed to undo military spending cuts enacted by Congress."""" Playing right into our enemies hands. Russia, China, North Korea, Fidel Castro all want Trump to be elected. No military force U. S. will be an easy target for communism and others forms of oligarchy government. """"Red Dawn"""" becoming a reality.

0,"RE: Maybe the no votes will find urgency in the latest declaration from a Standard & Poor's analyst Thursday: """"We may lower Alaska's credit rating if state policymakers defer adopting fiscal reforms to correct the state's structural deficit.""""  It's interesting how keenly timed and finely attuned these S & P releases are to every burp, cough and hiccup that emanates all the long way up here in Alaska's legislative hallways.  And oh how they mirror the same talking points developed by the financial investment co. owners, GCI honchos, Trump-wannabee/AFL-CIO Beltrami, bankers, a cadre of their lobbyists, AK Dispatch publisher, & others who were selectively chosen  to hatch these financial schemes in those closed-door, no-public or reporters meetings in the gov’s office.  Walker needs to claim who facilitated these serendipitously churned out S&P 'declarations' with APOC since AK statutes and regs mandate that Alaskans deserve to know who influences administration actions and legislation.

0,"When Bill Clinton committed numerous aggressive offenses against women - we were told to look past it for many reasons:  We were told by the media over and over again that his sexual escapades were his private life, which in no way affects his public office . . . . Hillary declared to the world that everything was a """"VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY"""" to get her husband.  The left said we were a bunch of 'Victorian prudes' to be concerned about such things. They lectured us on not being 'judgmental' They said , """"aren't Christians supposed to forgive and move on"""".  Now that it is someone with a different ideology than liberalism - we are basically told to crucify him and level the worst condemnation upon him, showing no mercy.  You can't have it both ways. Besides, the things Trump has only spoken, are the things Bill has done and HILLARY HAS VEHEMENTLY DEFENDED HIM!

During the election our local Dispatch ran stories every day of the week attacking Trump.  IF he lied all the time , they would have piled on even more.   The fact is , Trump offered his opinions on how to solve America's problems and make us great again. Over 62 million of us agreed with him and made him our next president. Perhaps you have him confused with Hillary Clinton. She's the one that got caught destroying evidence . Without Putin and Russia she might have got away with it.  With the truth exposed , American's decided with their votes she was who we thought she was---dishonest and untrustworthy . The liberal press let her off the hook , but the American voters did not.   Your hope is gone--the election result won't be changed.  It's time to accept the fact Trump is your next president .

The abundant rewards flow to the successful in the USA. (its the poor uneducated person who would not go to the US and would be more likely to stay in Canada) On another note, Canadians have to lose their jealousy for achievers. In America, the successful are revered and placed on a pedestal. They average citizen believes  with hard work they can also become successful. In Canada the successful are vilified. Hard work, sacrifice and achievement are met with disdain and jealousy.

Trump's enemies, and there are so very many, are obsesses with this 'Russian thing'. But why? Trump is already in office. Why of course to try to impeach him, to overthrow him. But then do they know what it takes to successfully impeach a POTUS? Let me tell you what it takes - it is harder than getting elected.  What this obsession tells me is, the Democratic Party and the liberal folks don't have a single policy idea to put forth to oppose Trump. None to run in the mid-term.

0,"The most egregious announcement was that Trump has decided “that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.” Trump is simply setting up a funnel for foreign government donations to the government. Since that funnel runs through his hotel, it boosts the brand value of his hotel and, thus, Trump. It doesn’t prevent diplomats from choosing to stay in his hotel to curry favor with him. It will still flatter him, because he flatters easily. Also, we will never know if he even donates the money, because he doesn’t provide proper accounting documentation for anything, and it’s not clear how “foreign government payments” would be separately accounted for anyway. It’s a joke idea that does nothing and is stupid, and people will applaud it. This is a recurring theme in his life, which is unfortunately now ours, too.

It doesn’t represent the people. It will never represent the people and we’re going to do something about it.” (‘No anonymous sources,’ Trump scolds; Feb 24). The report added, “conservatives [are] happy to have a scrapper in the White House who’s often on their side.”  It was because of their vicious, unrelenting attacks on Barry Goldwater trotted out as “news” 53 years ago I soon realized the media are indeed the enemy.

As for 'lack of civility' it likely comes from the constant attacks NOT backed with facts, just restating lies and opinions from left wingers.

In 2011 the Republicans controlled the house and from 2014 until present have control of both the House and Senate. The Republicans had 7 years to """"FIX"""" it. Even with 7 years in May 2017, they couldn't put together a bill good enough to be passed and it was pulled off the Senate floor. Donald Trump """"The greatest plan in history"""", pulled from the floor. ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry! Back to the house and this time the bill passes in the house only to be declared by Donald Trump himself the bill was """"mean"""" even though he declared earlier the bill was """"incredibly well crafted."""". Now with a total rewritten bill made behind closed doors the Republicans can not muster the numbers needed. If it fails blame it not on the Democrats but on the Republicans who control the Congress.

This is a man that Trump is looking to making Secretary of State or in charge of some other Intelligence agency. If appointed he will be the third general in his cabinet which has never happened.

Clearly Canada's establishment is still in the power of the right wing American establishment. It's therefore not surprising that Canada has drifted ever more to the right wing. Not surprising, after decades of American attacks on liberalism and corporate takeover of government, the definition of """"liberal"""" has become more conservative. As Canada's quintessential """"liberal"""", Lawrence Martin should take responsibility for Canada's right wing drift. Bottom line: in the Pierre Trudeau era, Canadians were brave enough to be independent of the US; today many are afraid to join the entire world in giving Castro his due. Worse they're joining  US crazies like Rubio and Cruz perpetuating the same old Cold War anti-communist propaganda. Wake up, Canadians.

Trump has said he bears personal animosity for Latinos and wants to expel all 11 million back to their country of origin.  Saddam wiped out millions of his own people, the Kurds, with chemical bombs while he reigned. He called the Kurds terrorists. Trump called Latinos criminals and rapists.  We have much to fear from this man who wants to be president and one who personally admired Saddam as a great dictator. Trump has complained that the N.J. and N.Y. terrorist has rights. He does.

Make no mistake:  Very few American politicians put their country before themselves and/or their friends.  That's why they make us all so nervous.

How could minorities not become increasingly more skeptical of the good intentions of white citizens after this election regarding their concerns, especially from those white citizens who profess to be Christian?

0,"The problem Steven is that BC's economy rests on a foundation of resource development, agriculture and forestry. There are three ways you can create wealth.  You can make stuff, or you can grow stuff or you can dig stuff up.  You might not have noticed but these three ways of creating wealth appear to be declining in BC.  Everything else is just paper shuffling. Who can afford to manufacture anything outside niche industries in BC?  Forestry has just run into a Trump in the road.  Agriculture appears to be disappearing under the expanding suburbs of the Lower Mainland.  When was the last time a mine opened in BC? Or even a major dam?  Now that oil and gas development appears to be actively discouraged what's left?  Tourism?  Very seasonal and BC's high costs are discouraging.  Real Estate?  Now that's a bubble just waiting to burst.  Government Services?  That only spends wealth.  Perhaps extorting funds from other provinces in order to let them trade is all BC has left.

0,"Apparently you are not aware of the US anti-missile defenses. The THAAD system, which is deployed in SK, will take out their missiles, of which NK has very few. IF, by some miracle, the THAAD system does not take out one of their missiles, the Arleigh Burke-class USA destroyers, which are """"parked"""" east of NK, will shoot down the missile(s) with their Aegis anti-missile rockets, THEN, if by some INCREDIBLE luck a NK missile gets through, the anti-missile defenses in California and Alaska will shoot the missile down upon re-entry. So rest well - NK is is a peanut in comparison and will eventually back down, as the world knows Trump is not to be fooled with.

0,"Il Duce Trump just brought the entire Republican party out of its closet entitled """"conservative"""" to replace the reality of its """"fascism"""".  Trump is the poster child for the real Republican party found in every closed gathering in the back rooms of America.  All of the governing proposals and intents since the 1930s have been to establish a Fascist State.  The Corporate ancestors of the same era, especially arms manufacturers, jumped into bed with Hitler and Mussolini for the entire war prior to Dec. 7, 1941 when they all were required to become U.S. patriots or die.  They took up the fascist banner after the war to reestablish the same in this nation, and succeeded in many ways.  Now, their nominee opens up the closet to show the true nature of the Republican party from stem to stern.  Shannyn expressed it perfectly, Republicans see their mirror image exposed for all to see.

0,"Glad to see you now acknowledge that it's an illegal action (i.e. WRONG).  I never said anything about which is WORSE than the other.

If someone is verbally abusing someone in public, and they respond by throwing a punch, it may feel deserved but physical violence is still worse than verbal insults.  And is reflected so in our laws and punishments.

0,"There are two conspiracy theories that, if true, we can be thankful for. One is that FDR knew about Pearl Harbor and let it happen. If there had been no Pearl Harbor, our isolationists and home-grown Fascist sympathizers would have let the war drag on until it was unwinnable. And the other is that the OSS and NKVD did in Patton. (The OSS needed the NKVD because they hadn't had the class on poisons yet at Hogwarts.) Patton was a danger in the summer of 1945 with his calls to attack the Soviets, but by the time he died in December, he was a non-issue. But if he'd entered politics back home, he'd have made the McCarthy Era ten times uglier than it was. So, yes, Trump sounds like Patton in all the wrong ways. He can complete the image by going to a VA hospital and slapping a few PTSD soldiers.

She's saying that Hollywood figured out what dupes people all are, and politicians like Trump are following suit. Thus, the implication of my original point still stands, that Shannon has relied mainly on a stereotype of slack-jawed (or in this case, spray cheese-eating) yokels to explain people's actions, taking the easy way out, instead of adding something interesting to the discussion about our impending political disaster. She effectively calls people idiots for their choices instead of trying to understand those choices and taking a nuanced approach. And the way she did it, creating the high/low divide, was a copout.

His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.""""

The head of counterintelligence for our country is William Evanina. He’s responsible for catching moles or double agents.   Now, try to imagine how Mr. Evanina felt when he learned on January 2nd that President Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn had been on the phone repeatedly December 29th reassuring the Russian ambassador that there need be no reciprocal American expulsions from Russia because the new administration would take a different approach.  Imagine how he felt when he listened to Donald Trump later explain that he hadn’t ordered Flynn to do this but that he would have ordered him to do it if he hadn’t already done so.

No similarity exists except in the lazy minds or false claims of pundits and reporters.  Unidentified Sanders supporters are portrayed as violent, women haters as they challenge the women leaders manipulating the party rules in favor of Clinton.  By anonymity, the press establishes its own agenda orchestrated by their owners.  Trump's broad-based bigotry and misogyny has no parallel in the Sanders campaign.

The US never did anything to stop them, which is why they continue. Obama also signed the largest increase in US-taxpayer-funded “aid” in US history, so his Administration underwrote much of this.  Since every penny violates existing US and international laws as a result of Israel’s defiance of the UN, systemic violation of its Charter and the very laws intended to prevent such an injustice, use of weapons procured with this money to enforce a criminal occupation and against civilians, support for terrorists, and clandestine programs of nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare (WMD), activists must begin to challenge this in the courts.

It happens all the time in this country without the sensationalism associated with it when engaged in by a public figure such as Trump. Frankly people's personal lives, maybe especially public figures, are none of my business.  It's a big wonderful world of human interactions and what works for you may not work for me but so what? Women who detractors call """"trophies"""" or """"arm candy"""" may be engaging in a mutually beneficial arrangement, hopefully with some emotional satisfaction for both parties.

The only difference was that Trump named those people. But the story was always the same. Do you think Reagan's 'welfare queen' was white? But Reagan and the Bushes spoke of 'welfare queens' and 'gang violence' and 'radical Islamic terrorism' . Trump just said 'Mexicans and Muslims'.  That's not a change. It means the exact same thing.

Debt increased by $15B  Under Gordon Campbell's BC Liberals, provincial GDP from 2001 through .... 2009 and 2010, that number slips to 2.4 per cent. Total Debt increased by $140B  Growth in the last 3 years was all based on the real estate sellout.

0,"Please explain why this event requires an endorsement for any kind of protest. Campaign visits to Eugene by presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were met here with lollipops and rainbows (and in the latter case, ice cream cones and a basketball jersey). Upon each's somber return in the wake of the Thurston and UCC shootings, protestors were derided for not respecting the office; you were near the front of that parade of criticism last fall.  I'm not 73, have never protested anything and have never believed telling others how to live is being a good neighbor, never mind a responsible citizen. However, I've long had a fascination with successful people, regardless of their political stripe, who somehow possess the mettle to move mountains. That includes Clinton and Obama, among many others.  Like it or not, Trump has accomplished something quite remarkable. That flaccid guarantee of contentiousness for his visit is not.

Bankruptcies, affairs, divorces, lawsuit settlements, bragging of sexual assaults, non-payment of vendors are things that don't scream GOOD American to this American.  Who are the Socialist-Democrats you reference?  How do THEY start an investigation at will?  You do know the U.S. President generates NO legislation for anyone to hold up, right?  When has trump ever shown a history of getting along with team players?  What actual crimes? trump promised to """"lock her up"""".  Why hasn't he kept HIS promise.  Who or what are Dimms?  Hillary actions were investigated.  You missed that it seems.  The Attorney General must allow what's legal, even if he is Sessions appointed by trump and no matter what you feel.  Blows to the other side and retaliatory misuse of authority is not effective government nor decent people skills.  Whatever trump may need, the U.S Attorney General is not his to use, much less """"going after the other side"""".

When enlisting as a foot soldier or a CIA agent you swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Not to uphold """"until I don't want to anymore"""". Because their is a change in leadership does not make that vow go away.  This is one of many OBOMA legacies worming out of the bloated sack of politicized larvae.  A government agency such as the CIA is not a place to trumpet your opinion.  A bit of perceived """"rheteric"""" makes him a quitter. Never should have been hired...ATTITUDE. Imagine jumping off a landing craft at Normandy on D-Day invasion and telling your commander """"I cant work for Eisenhower anymore"""" he said things that upset me!

0,"Oh, lets be clear about one thing here. Hillary is a liar as shown repeatedly by FBI Director Comey. Hillary has been, according to the FBI, extremely careless with sensitive, classified information. So careless that if anyone other than Hillary were to do the same, they would find themselves charged, convicted and doing a rather large amount of time in prison. I would be just as concerned about a republican doing the same things. Most republicans were actively supporting impeachment of Nixon. Republicans supported Gingrich resigning until it was found that he did nothing illegal or wrong. I have a very large problem with anyone who lies about anything and everything, over and over and do not care what party they are from, Trump included. I know that most politicians lie about a whole lot but Hillary takes lying to a whole new level. The thing that completely tears it for me, after spending 15 years working in Naval Intelligence, is the arrogant misuse of classified information.

Gore challenged an incredibly close vote in a critical state, and if Trump intends merely to assert his right to do the same thing if the same situation arises, no one would have a problem with that.  Ultimately, Gore accepted a court decision with which he did not agree; he respected the rule of law.  Trump has once again today expressed his utter contempt for the people and the Constitution of the United States: he solemnly asserted that he will accept the outcome of the election (dramatic pause) -- if he wins.  Trump is the puppet not of Putin, or at least not just of Putin, but of Steve Bannon, the white supremacist and anti-Semite who is the CEO of his campaign. They are laying the groundwork for the neo-fascist media effort they will launch when this awful campaign is finally ended. Deplorable? Despicable.

Even a minuscule suggestions in the newspaper words would be twisted and torn to shreds by wolfs of media. Mr. Manning at least acknowledges few of the issues and lists them. Where current events like M-103 (fortunately unsuccessful), political correctness and phobias are simply fanning the flames. Mr. Manning’s words are a shot across the bow of the ship. The folks at the feeding troughs in Ottawa, may want to pay attention. Any party who addresses these overwhelming world wide issues is worth listening to.

0,"The Canadian FPTP system has served the country well for almost 150 years. It is the system used by the strongest, most robust democracies in the world; namely the UK and the US. It enables checks and balances on the major parties so that the country proceeds largely down the middle of the road. Proportional representation systems are the hallmark of emerging democracies and welfare states. Under FPTP,  typically new leaders, such as Trump or Trudeau or Cameron, are elected because the voters are focused on throwing out the old leaders and governing parties.

It would seem that they decide now what's important to you, not the American people and you have only yourselves to look to for that. Did Clinton rail against Bill, Wiener when caught (she is close to both)? Nope, it's ok with her apparently, but rail she does against someone like Trump. She hasn't even mentioned Bill Cosby as she has been advised by her people to avoid that at all costs lest it be compared to her Bill. Hillary is the more evil of the two however, she filled the swamp, Trump didn't. And I guess it's ok for Weiner to sext underage girls and have no comment in spite of her trying to convince America she's for you.

Supporting small businesses will help those small shops that we enjoy so much.  [As an aside, we may want to be careful of what we read in the media.

Yet some feel the need to force others to agree with an act or lifestyle that they do not agree with. One persons rights does not trump another's.

Nor should a law even be made to offer that protection for there already is. First Amendment to the Bill of Rights.

The fact you have a problem with that says something, but not that the bishops and priests were campaigning for Trump.

As the definition of fascism involves leadership by corporations, it is reasonable to believe that private security forces could constitute 'uniformed soldiers.'  Hitler's 'brown shirts' were essentially a precursor to our Neighborhood Watch, and it is not unreasonable to assume that such a body could be co-opted easily by Trump. If you are inclined to point out that today's neighborhood watch is composed of all ethnic groups, you need to know that Fascism is not necessarily racist. Hitler played the race card to polarize the vote, and Germanies' 1934 night of the Long Knives was the event that 'purified' his Brown Shirts, who were initially composed of anybody who was like-minded... including ethnic Jews, Asians, Russians, etc.

If the Republicans had their way, via the Trump tax reform framework, they would eliminate federal estate taxes, death taxes and generation skipping taxes which would all lead to an increase in income inequality and thus an increase in poverty and  homelessness. They would also severely cut the safety net, such as slashing federal funding for affordable housing as well as knocking millions of struggling Americans off of food stamps and medical insurance, which would lead to an increase in homelessness, as many of those living in poverty have to choose between paying for rent and paying for food or health premiums.

I don't happen to believe that is the way to arrive at the best outcomes for our country, state, county or city, nor would I think it the best if the R-G were a conservatively slanted newspaper doing the same thing to the liberal viewpoint.

0,"I didn't pass the test for civility so the rest of my comment did not fly. I was saying that the hypocrisy behind Catholic anti-abortion rhetoric is a moral failing for many Catholics. I am pro-life, but have a broader understanding of what that means than to limit it to a fetus. Catholic votes got George Bush elected and he decimated Iraqui civilians waging an illegitimate was based upon fudged data, or lies, to be more correct. Trump got elected with the help of the Catholic vote because of his anti-abortion stance, and we can see where that got us. If there is a moral crisis, it is partly due to the behavior of Catholics in America. I won't let Catholics off the hook-the Bishops may be late for the bus, but many Catholics never knew when the bus arrived. They are out to lunch, serving a bogus conception of redemption based upon obedience to moral law that has nothing to do with grace, salvation, compassion, or, in fact, Christianity.

This puts him in executive experience and accomplishments above any five of Trudeau's cabinet ministers combined.  So please lower the snark and the Trump-and-all-his-team derangement syndrome levels a touch, put the secretary into proper perspective both in terms of his remarkable record and talents and his influence on the president, and this way you won't come off as ridiculous.  The actual strategist whom Martin quotes in regard to Tillerson is right that he is certain to have a strong input in regard to NAFTA and other US-Canada issues.

Nothing more than on side saying someone is a s.o.b. and the other side saying if you want to talk about an s.o.b., talk about Trump. Another problem is that testimony is given in secrecy and is protected by strict confidentiality. If a person testifies or gives """"half-truths,"""" how is someone who knows the """"whole truth"""" able to question the testimony?

I, for example, might be a fan of Senator Elizabeth Warren and feel she'd be a better President than either Clinton or Trump.  Should I, """"out of principle"""", write-in her name on my ballot?  I feel Ms. Clinton would be a much better President than Mr. Trump and to write-in Senator Warren instead of voting for Ms Clinton may feed my self-righteousness, but it directly violates my principled belief that I should work to support the election of the best candidate POSSIBLE.

Nevertheless, he sought relief through an application for cancellation of removal,""""  Just one of the 1.9 million now  illegal immigrants who Trump wants to deport, again.

This is simply hocus-pocus voodoo film flammery projecting massive revenue from imaginary nonexistent projections.  It's as ludicrous as attempting to balance your own budget on the assumption you're going to win the lottery next month, so all those debts you pile up won't matter because the lottery winning in your future will make the numbers balance out.  You of the trumpery go ahead and try to tell yourselves this is why you voted for Trump.  Know that other folks are perfectly aware that you voted for Trump because you fell for the film-flammery.

0,"It was a bizarre scene out of some Junior High after-school group who had been punished and forced to go to detention. Part of their punishment was to praise their principal, clearly.  Trump spoke for a few minutes about all of his imagined accomplishments, boasting about how well President Obama's economy is performing, (taking credit for it), and even citing great unemployment numbers that he repeatedly called fake during the presidential election.  He finally turned to his propaganda round table and made each cabinet member state their names like children at a Motel Six seminar.

This is not Trump's mess. This is everyone's mess that had a hand in the past 4 administrations. Listening and reading words like this article is stunning. After 30 years of pushing the problem down the road they have the nerve to start criticizing Trump. I have never seen or read so many feckless cowards in my life in one brief 5 day period.

As  long as Canada meets reasonable wage and environmental standards the end of NAFTA will be a boon for the country not a loss.

We shouldn't mistake different domestic values or policies for internationally significant trade or geopolitical disputes in this context, however. Arguably, Trump's US doesn't currently have such open dispute issues with Canada and therefore Trump has little interest in adding bad relation with Canada to his growing list of issues to be addressed at this time.  Such disputes may well arise in due course .but neither Government will want to push those buttons now (but the possibility remains that Trump may stumble off message through inadvertance).

Comey states he could find no evidence of legal application for a wire tap in Trump tower and yet the media says, SEE TRUMP WAS LYING ALL ALONG.

Its telling that these two groups were not significant participants in these protest marches. Visual parsing shows that these were predominantly upper class females who could afford to travel to Washington where Trump only got 4 % of the vote.  Another very telling statistic. Trump got  42 % of the female vote compared to Clinton at 54 %.  This is a typical gender based expectation. But, among while female votes, Trump got 58 %.  These stats show that these protests were exclusively from the Democrat/ liberal elites. This group has done very well under Obama,( doubling their share of national wealth )  with the lower 50 % being left with most of the debt .  Which is why Trump got elected

Middle class people voted for Trump because Obamacare drove all of their existing healthcare costs up over 100% and the deductibles for those  expensive healthcare plans increased by 200-300%.  It is really that simple. If trump does anything to actually reduce these costs then he has a real shot at a second term.  Trudeau will end up with a minority government after the next election for the same reason. The middle class sees what is happening to their paychecks. Wait until the CPP/EI changes get added to your tax bill next year on top of carbon taxes and other clawbacks.  People vote with their wallets.

I have stated before in Civil Beat, handing the nuclear codes to either Ms. Clinton or Mr. Trump is the equivalent of handing a loaded firearm to a four year old.  As one reader pointed out, our crystal balls are certainly clouded to where we cannot foresee what will happen in either of the potential administration.  We cannot lay the blame for what happens on one person or one administration either.  It is a collection of decisions that influence where and what happens.  Unfortunately, the 'why' and the unintended consequences are not thoroughly explored.  I'm sure there are people (civil servants) who argued against involvement in Vietnam (my war), Iraq and Afghanistan but were overruled by political higher-ups and for political convenience.  The United States was made world cop by default after World War Two.  We just need to learn how to do a better job of it if we are going to remain in the job.

On CNN, a few minutes ago, they first showed a video of Trump relating that he had just been briefed on his plane that there had been a bombing in NY City, Then they showed a video of Hillary saying that we need to wait until we get all the details before commenting in detail. This comment was actually after she had already stated that she had been briefed about a bombing in NY City.

0,"""""The debacle of the Haitian illegal migrants seeking asylum (queue-jumping, really) is an black eye to our national immigration policy."""" No, that's not right.  It's happening because of two things: Trump's attitude toward immigration & refugees, and a misunderstanding on the part of some Haitians about what this will mean for them.  Canada is handling it in the only reasonable way possible under our laws -- by providing food & shelter and assessing the cases; anything else would be more chaotic.   The vast majority, quite probably, will be sent back.  It is hardly """"Canada's fault"""", nor is it  a black eye.

1,"This editorial must be taken in the context of the hate Trump rhetoric that has been going on so long now.  The questions asked in the editorial's opening lines are fake because nobody said such people are """"fine.""""  It is true that some fine people object to the removal of historical statues.  This is what the President referred to.  Actually, I find the liberal comments hilariously hypocritical.  The willingness to condemn and dehumanize is the essential ingredient of an extremist be it a Nazi white supremacist or whatever.  Liberals are deep into that activity demonstrating that they are in fact equivalent to the objects of their hate.  If anybody wants to engender warmth and respect among all our people, the action must start at home.  The attacks on Trump are inconsistent with desired mutual respect.  Words and thoughts are put in his mouth.  Anyone who really cared would be asking him to explain his thoughts rather than projecting their ugly views on him.

0,"""""The Bernie Sanders Show"""" is an excellent podcast that deals rationally with issues like science, climate change and the dark money currently subverting America's democracy while denying climate change.  Amongst the early guests on the show have been Bill Nye - the Science Guy, Josh Fox and Jane Mayer.  https://www.sanders.senate.gov/bernies-podcast  Great to see an independent politician dealing with real issues that matter to the American people in such a frank and honest way.  Even though the AP sabotoged his campaign with a highly inappropriate early call for Clinton the night before the US's biggest Democratic primary last June, I think I'll listen to Bernie and just ignore Trump for the next 1 - 3 years.

Trump values loyalty to the point he can't see he's being played and Bannon most certainly knows how to play Trump.  Trump has his scapegoat in place for when the racist card blows up in his face.  The only thing that surprises me about all of this is that Bannon must think he can avoid the scapegoat role.  He won't.

It's one thing to argue that rich people deserve 80% of the cut, but to say they don't benefit more than the """"middle class"""" who may get $180 to $400 per year is just jaw-dropping. Trump alone would immediately save $32 million based on his 2005 tax return. His kids save an estimated $3.1 billion if his net worth statements are accurate. And, people should think about what we don't get with this tax cut: money to fix roads, bridges, dams, schools, airports, electrical grid, etc. America will crumble while the 400 richest families share almost a trillion dollars...which I'm sure they need desperately.

0,"A few thoughts:  If the Democrat party had not rigged their primary for Hillary and laced their email with racist and anti Semitic remarks, there would have been nothing for the Russians or anyone else to leak that would be considered damaging or interfering in our election process. This is on the Democrats themselves, but this article attempts to deflect the onus to Trump and the Russians. Don't be fooled.  Trump is in favor of strengthening NATO by getting all members to contribute the financial resources they have promised. Coddling and allowing them to not contribute, as this and previous administrations have done, is a poor strategy and weakens NATO. Trump will fix this. Kristof and others would rather demagogue the issue and use it to get votes for Hillary.  Putin would much rather deal with Hillary than Trump. He has her email and will use it against her after she wins the election. He knows if he appears to help Trump he will be disadvantaged by the press. Putin is not stupid.

( Now if Trump had been a former bar doorman/bouncer or snow board instructor, we should send Trudeau instead of Mulroney.)  Mr. Trump has always said that he wants to make good, fair free trade deals on a bilateral basis so this might be the way things will ultimately go.  And the problems Trump has with NAFTA are almost solely with the Mexican aspect of it.  So as Martin argues, Mulroney would be a perfect negotiator to salvage the best possible deal for us.

Compare that to the growing trend of entitled liberal arts snowflakes groomed for failure in the US and Canada. The reason manufacturing is leaving the US is because there isn't a qualified labor base (including basic programming and technical electrical skills involved in today's manufacturing). The same can be said for Canada, we are not investing in strong technical apprenticeship programs (like Germany for example) - that support modern manufacturing. Trump wants to increase US exports and reduce imports from the same countries he is targeting for exports - he is a short-sighted clown shoe.

You spend plenty time knocking his lies but hate his truth, go figure. Your 4, why bring in the red herring of extramarital sex, getting desperate AJ?

Whatever they do or say now won't make a difference, they've waited too long. Trump won't drop out and his followers won't abandon him so they are tied by the Republican umbilical cord that they connected, he has poisoned and they don't have penicillin strong enough to save it.

It stopped broadcasting in Russian in 2008, but it could be a strong source of real news to the Russian People. Previously, perhaps, after the fall of the Soviet Union, it made sense to try and make nice with the struggling Russian government.

State and local taxes. Trump wants to take this deduction away because he says that only high-income people deduct this. But in the state like Hawaii it's an important deduction for the middle class as well.  Payroll taxes. We should deduct all of it and not just a portion.  And I would start paying taxes at the minimum wage rate rather than at $15,000. More like over $20,000 a year.

Traitorous Trump could have ordered the armed forces to conduct an emergency air evacuation of the island, moving hundreds of thousands of the most directly threatened to safety. He didn’t. The people of Puerto Rico are suffering, and it took days of public shaming for someone in the White House to finally schedule a visit as Trump has made his racist attacks on athletes his main priority on Twitter. It’s more than safe to assume many Americans in Puerto Rico would much rather see an Air Force One full of supplies and food rather than one full of Trumps.

Whereas the Charlottesville murder and violence you are ascribing to to a whole swathe of the population. Perhaps Donald Trump's elevation to the Presidency will awake America to the fact that it is not an homogenised society and something needs to be done about it. That 'liberalism' can and will never solve it, rather it can only exacerbate it. The Church must never involve itself in racist issues. These issues were faced by Our Lord, Himself and He never pronounced upon them. Everyone is equal in the eyes of God. How that effects them in real life depends upon how they find themselves.  The opportunity for the persecuted, the prisoners, the slaves to gain eternal salvation were at least equal if not   those who were freemen. Is that not what we can all hope for?

But that is a very selective """"fact"""", refuted, as I pointed out substantially more cases, earlier in this string.  Your second (latest) response, you'd """"rather allow a million fraudulent votes than prevent a million legal votes"""". That's simply a false choice! I want all legal voters to vote and NO fraudulent voters to vote. While """"NO fraudulent votes"""" may be unrealistic, striving for an honest vote is a very worthy goal.  Trump's Voter Fraud Commission is having the desired effect! Illegal registrants and voters are removing themselves!

Everyone else pays taxes to support the program and have their benefits cut or pay more for their coverage. As a Republican staffer told me when asked why the big tax cut, he said so Ivanka, Jared, and Trump's sons can get a $200,000 tax break each year and not have to ask daddy for spending money-- I took it as a joke, but it has meaning.

And then some back-tracking. And the world watches, as Trump takes his idea of deal-making (Trump wins, the others must be losers) into the world of international relations. Tomorrow he will be meeting 'my' Prime Minister, Theresa May - who has said this evening that she hopes """"to stand strong together to defend our values, our interests and the very ideas in which we believe"""". But if she really knows what Trump's """"values, interests and ideas"""" are, then her real duty is to moderate or oppose them as much as possible. But I'm not very confident. Expect a lot of platitudes.

While few us would regret seeing NK leadership destroyed, it would most likely mean millions of victims, NK, would also die.  Suki_Kim found love of her students, putting their safety first, but she had no kind words for the Korean leadership.  The other thing that struck me is that Trump is Kim Jong-un ' light', at least in character.   I can only imagine the pleasure national worship would bring to President.   To have every statement he makes be pronounced 'TRUE', with no rebuttal allowed must surely sound like heaven to the President who condemns a free press that will actually check his statement for truth.

0,"IRT kuroiwaj, I see no contradiction between the two paragraphs.  The first paragraph points out that the professionals that Trump has hired are bound by a code of ethics to be confidential with Trump's tax information.  Because they are hired by Trump they will present Trump in the best light possible.  Confidentiality also means you cannot reveal questionable dealings or transaction (squeal) to the authorities unless of course your client wants you to.  So in other words these professional have a conflict of interest because they are being paid to represent Trump.  So their assurances are kind of meaningless.  Got it?  The second paragraph is pretty self explanatory.  Trump promised to release his returns and he says there is nothing wrong with them.  If so then why not release them?

It seems to postulate that the exposure of indecency is a greater misdeed than the indecency.  ...and, yes, IMO, two high school administrators employing mocking humor using high school students as their """"foils"""" is an indecency.  You mention """"fear of humor"""".....balderdash.  Humor is wonderful, it brightens our lives.  """"Cruel, mocking humor"""" is an entirely different matter.

I have no doubt that Trump believes that only a """"sucker"""" or a """"loser"""" keeps his/her word.  For this reason, it is not possible for world leaders to expect any good-faith dealings with Trump.  He's reneged, as you rightly point out, on visas that were issued by the U.S. government.  I strongly suspect most world leaders know there is no good-faith bargain to be had with Trump.  The smart ones are very likely forming their own new trade consortium and will deal within it.

0,"The National Anthem doesn't have any feelings.  Therefore, it can't be disrespected.  It is many of the people, in their post-9/11 neo-patriotism, that get offended.  I have no doubt that it will someday be mandated by law or executive order that people have to stand for it.  As a matter of fact, if Trump is in office for 4 years, it will happen during that time.  My main point is that you don't know anything about the guy, or the other players that have done so, and yet they're automatically jerks because they refused to stand for a song that, quite frankly, is overplayed and has been used too much for political purposes as of late.  I have worked at several schools.  Some did the POA every day, some did it on Monday mornings only, and a couple didn't do it at all.  Guess what?

It now seems that wasn’t merely a matter of optics and presidential statements. Critical time was lost and things didn’t happen. Once the scope of catastrophe began to become clear, Trump’s inaction began to generate criticism. Once that happened Trump proceeded to fold Puerto Rico into his comfort zone politics of grievance and narcissism. The focus shifted to Puerto Rico’s debt, ingratitude and – finally this morning – laziness and disorganization. Trump has brought nothing but shame on us all.

The best example is in our own national defense, where the end result of the process, hiding itself behind so-called fairness, has resulted too often in procuring foreign made goods, sometimes second hand, whilst our top engineering  students have to go south to find those mesningful jobs.

The simple fact of the matter is that Donald Trump is not competent for the role that he is now in. I have never been a fan of Hillary Clinton, and didn't like many of her ideas, but she would have been at least capable of doing the job at its most basic level. There is no reasonable comparison between the two.  Unfortunately, partisanship makes this impossible for many to see. It long ago became *normal* to accuse your opponent of incompetence, even though it was almost never true. When it is standard playbook to blow minor scandals out of proportion, people suddenly find it easy to dismiss major ones. If parties are going to mercilessly attack the ethics of each other's candidate anyway, then why bother following ethical rules?  These are the consequences of an increasingly vitriolic political landscape, and today the slide continues.

0,"It is rare that a Canadian Prime Minister shows such monumentally poor judgment as this.  What was Justin Trudeau thinking?  For crying out loud, when a bombastic foreign leader runs an election race on a string of pungent campaign promises, you have to just see them as words. The Prime Minister should know very well that, once in office, the newly elected leader may not follow through with what was promised.  And so the wise approach would have been to wait ands see, to find out if this was one of those promises that the newly elected leader would let fade away and be forgotten.  But no, Justin Trudeau had to do what he foolishly thought was the wise (roll eyes) thing to do. What an embarrassment of a decision and what blindness of perspective.  What Justin Trudeau has broadcast to Mr. Trump is that Canada is the obedient little poodle that rolls over withs legs in the air any time that the big loud dog has a fit of angry barking.

And she's a woman strong enough to take on this inevitable revolting blowback from the endemic misogyny and toxic patriarchy that plagues our nation (which Trump very much personifies). It was inevitable that the first female candidate would have to endure this relentless harassment and ridiculous scrutiny and attacks and absolutely ridiculous allegations.

As per,""""the two political parties, the buoys that have defined U.S. political life since the end of the Civil War"""" it could be said that although the Republicans did win the election , it could also be said that in essence, Trump was an Independent. Trump is to the Right  to what Bernie Saunders was to the Left. This is indeed a shift from the so called norm's since the end of WWII, with each party's having candidates that are a little further from the center.  How will Trump's vision for America's future unfold? Who knows. If he can somehow deliver without unleashing civil anarchy, he may serve another term. After all, Baby Bush as unpopular and unpalatable as he was managed to serve 2 terms. However, if Trump's Libertarianism pulls the US into civil unrest reminiscent of the 60's with numerous factions of society rebelling on a daily basis, if he initiates a global trade/currency war in which there are no winners,in 4 years we may see the way for a Socialist/Bernie.

Whatever a person actually says is irrelevant. What is relevant is what you say is the true meaning and intent of the words used.  Why even bother listening to what a person says. All we have to do is ask you about what a person thinks.  There is no increase in the rise of hate crimes since Trumps election. If their is an increase in anti-immigration sentiment and expression, this is to be expected when you have a government acting with utter contempt for the American people. Blame those who advocate the lawless and chaotic manner in which illegals come to America and remain.  In any case a nation's government has no authority to allow millions of foreign national to enter.

Mueller may say that 'while mistakes were made, no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges.'  Until any final determination is made, yes our President deserves the benefit of the doubt. Some gang members are involved in a gang that is 'illegal' to be part of. Just being in it presumes guilt.  I don't believe they should be beaten, but the police have a job to do and expecting them to be polite when arresting 'known' criminals goes beyond protecting civil rights. Cops are human too and when they have just arrested someone who they know has committed violent crimes in the past and breezes  through the  legal system of revolving doors, they may get a little rough. Their primary job is to protect law abiding citizens.

When my ancestors came here from Ireland and Poland between 1850 and 1880, there were no government handouts of any kind, and they thought America was such a great and wonderful nation that they wanted to be patriotic, assimilated Americans.

They want to cut the pay of SOLDIERS. They want to pull the food out of the mouths of children and the elderly. What kind of sense does this make? How do the trump apologists actually try to defend this nonsense? Are his followers in a trance?

If trump was more mature, he would ignore the threats and concentrate on rallying the world to make sanctions more effective.  However, being thin-skinned and narcissistic, he responds like a spoiled toddler being told """"no.""""  Meanwhile, the war mongers who advocate military action also fail to understand the consequences of military action.  Sure, in the end, the destruction of north korea is assured, but how many thousands, or millions, of people will be killed to satisfy those impatient idiots?

0,"I agree DT probably has financial/business interests in Russia, and if they were known, they could be spun into a motive for being Putin's lapdog. But, Mike, ask yourself this question: Is Trump more driven by greed or by narcissism?  I think his greed, his need to succeed in business, to amass wealth, is driven by his narcissism. That why Trump's mind so easily construes objective business failure as personal success. Thus, both objective failure and objective success equally feed his narcissism.  As my brother famously said, Money is just the way we keep score. For Trump, his women are also just another way he keeps score. Both games feed his ego, his vanity.  In the end, we're both reading tea leaves, but I think my leave are prettier than yours.  ;-}

Horgan and Trudeau are increasing red tape and taxes on Canada's most important sectors (see Census data on wage growth over the last 10 years) while the US is doing the opposite. What comes next shouldn't surprise anyone. Meanwhile Moonbeam is trying to take natural gas out of Vancouver - you couldn't make up this kind of short-sighted incompetence if you tried.

Do we know of anyone who might prioritize business relationship riches, have the ego(s) that might make them vulnerable, and have access to sensitive US information?

Doctors can help addicts get off addictions.

They came back in September with no plan in place ( a work in some kind of progress) nothing to hand to Trump except for their idea. As usual, Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had their plan ready to pay the nation's debts and get the money to Texas for Hurricane relief now with a clean bill and no much argued about  """"riders and pork"""" and the full support of their caucus, something that eludes the GOPs in Congress. Trump needs his image makeover and would not risk fighting over this to pay the nation' debts and get the money out pronto to Texas.

Others, perhaps mindful of where they were, talked of Iran and the Lebanese Shia militia, Hezbollah, both considered mortal enemies by the Jewish state.

0,"Bad things are done by DJT, but it's not axiomatic that all of them are.  True enough. I agree with this author on almost all his points - bloviating by Infowars and Huffington Post about standard procedures that passed without comment in previous administration does damage to whatever rightful objections people do make now and in the future.  Before clicking share, check the sourcing of material and do a little reading on whether what has been done has precedent.  It saves a lot of harmful blowback and increases credibility. I depart with Tom Nichols in that I think the intent of the executive order banning immigration was absolutely targeted at Muslims. Rudy Giuliani who was firmly in Trump's camp candidly admits he advised on how to legally ban Muslims.  The administration itself has fumbled and fibbed their way through the whole debacle, making up terrorist attacks and neglecting ones committed by White right wing extremists. The NSC decision is a poor one too.

Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Iran is not in breach of the agreement.  Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iran is in compliance with the agreement.    No one says Iran is not in compliance, but Trump, not one of our allies, no one.  No one but Trump.  Trump says Iran is not in compliance because a treaty that works was put forth under a black president.  That's the only reason Trump will heedlessly take a flyer at destabilizing the Middle East.

Run to the nearest microphone to demand some type gun control, expecting a different result. I also believe the left knows immediately after each mass shooting, the shooter won't be a member of the NRA, so they have to changes the narrative as soon as possible.  It's emotion that liberalism is base on and it's emotions that drives the left. And isn't emotion what drives most of these mass attacks? The emotion of being bullied, or the constant hate for Trump, or the constant being promised X, Y,and Z, but never experiencing those promises. So a weak person takes matters in their own hands, with a gun. The gun is the means, but the lack of morality within the culture, including in the government and the media, politicians lying, FAKE NEWS, helps drives the shooters.

It's always somebody else's fault with Trump; somebody has to be blamed for his failures.  This is one of the clearest signs to date of his unfitness for office. Instead of stepping up, doing his job and *seeing it through*, he is running away and deserting desperate American citizens. U.S. presidents don't do that! Until now. Run away, Mr. President, but this one is going to stick to you.

North Korea has been blustering, threatening and extorting the free world for decades, and many Presidents have merely just paid off this madman (and his father) to keep them quite.  Now he's nearing the end of a Nuclear ICBM project and the threat has gotten to the point they can't just ignore and payoff this nutjob anymore, so they're just itching for ANY excuse to obliterate him..........It'll be along shortly, I'm sure.  All the pieces are falling into place. China, his only ally is warning him off, Russia, Japan all are giving him one last option to back down, they know where those radiation clouds will drift.  NK is a small country with a high density and clustered population (many of which are staving to death), with modern US armament technology (MOAB's, Cruise missiles etc.) if this nutjob so much as twitches NK will be an ashtray before you even know what's happened there. This isn't 1956 anymore.

It's legal for US border agents to turn someone away on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion (or just the way they look) regardless of what citizenship that person holds or whether he or she has valid travel documents.  The agents are taking their cues from Trump. Aside from the shame that this brings on the US,  it's a big problem for many Canadians who do business and have family in the US (or just want to participate with their school in a track meet). The Canadian government needs to stick up for Canadians by addressing these specific problems, not just by tweeting about welcoming immigrants.

That Lisa still tolerated that kind of nasty, ugly and vile ' coming out of her ears or whatever' talk from Trump after the Megan Kelly interview this year says a lot about her character.  That Lisa tolerated all the offensive and un-statesmanlike comments about anyone who did not agree with the Donald says a lot about how insensitive she's become to the ordinary, average Alaskan.  That Lisa tolerated and stayed silent re: his comments about Muslims...

Why doesn't the Trump White House permit congresspeople to use MATS to get to PR and see what's going on? They did so with FL and TX. I think it's mainly because PR isn't a part of CONUS, so Trump doesn't care. No payoff in 2020.

You know who benefits off the profits on those lands so you can't tell the public that trump didn't benefit the tribes in that area.  The states also have much more benefit and less regulations to do business now, so its not exempt from just a tribe or to a race but at the state and national level that benefits.

I am no defender of any theocratic state including Iran (and Israel). They have committed atrocities against their people and minorities but do not compare to ISIS. They mostly act to support Shiite minorities in countries like Yemen, Lebanon, Bahrain, and Syria. Their anti-Israeli language is hyperbole for internal consumption which is not matched by their actions. They need to be contained but compared to the threat to world peace from jihadist groups like ISIS & Al-Qaida, they are minor players. The US and Trump should not be siding totally with states like Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States which remains a seat for Sunni extremism that threatens the region and the world.

For this to happen by early next year, which is unlikely, each country must come away with something that looks to its consumers and exporters as an improvement/victory compared with the current deal and all three would also like to point to some areas of modernizing the 25 year old deal to make it seem the review and update was a good idea.  The final upgraded NAFTA treaty will be less than ideal for all three countries but with potential for a more equal trade balance and for enhanced cooperation and trade in technology areas that did not even exist at the time of the first NAFTA.  BTW, if it is considered civil and clever of you to call Trump The Russian Candidate is it also de rigueur for me to call Trudeau The Chinese Candidate?

0,"Your comments on climate change & economic policy betray the bubble in which you move. The """"trend lines"""" on climate change are moving in a positive direction, & the reason for that is simple: the market. The market has already shifted away from coal-fired electric generation & towards plentiful natural gas-powered electricity. And the result has been an already dramatic decrease in carbon emissions. Nothing that Donald Trump says or does will un-do this shift; the underlying economics of this shift dictate this. So if you want to continue these trend lines, then you should get out of the way of natural gas. Continue opposition to extraction of natural gas & its development will be the biggest obstacle to effective climate protection, not Trump.  Second, perhaps you've missed it, but cutting corporate taxes was a key piece of Pres. Obama's proposed tax plans. There is almost universal agreement that US corporate rates are a hindrance.

For years the GOP complained about the unwillingness of Obama to reach across the aisle. Now it seems the fractures within the Republican party will force the GOP to do just that to get their healthcare reform.  Trump fancies himself a dealmaker. It will be interesting to see whether he steps up to the plate now to broker a deal. My guess is that he won't. He is too lazy, too preoccupied with his own problems and too willing to blame others for his own failures. Besides, he has rapidly diminishing political capital with the lowest approval ratings of any President in polling history just 6 months in.  Sad.

Trump's animus against Islam is counterproductive in at least three ways: - It harms not only innocent people but also people who risked life and family to help the United States, people who have already passed through a thorough, two-year long vetting process. - It indicates to the world that the United States sees Islam itself as a (the?) enemy -- something that Presidents Bush and Obama were at great pains to avoid. Trump confirms the darkest view of the United States (as he did when he compared us unfavorably to Putin). - Most security experts agree that the greatest threat is from home-grown terrorists. Trump is recruiting for them.

His Norman Vincent Peale's 'The Power of Positive Thinking' training taught him that.  You see, he was a Peale acolyte and a member of Peale's Marble Collegiate Church as a youth and young man.  He and his first wife were married in that church.  And, Peale himself said that Trump was one of his brightest followers.  One of the peculiar things about that church is that there is not one picture or representation of the cross of Christ's crucifixion anywhere in the building.  And, Donald Trump said  during his campaign that he has never prayed for forgiveness and that he doesn't have to.  He is superior and complete and he said that he alone can save this nation and make it great again.

The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects, (shrinking penis, poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition, mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a """"disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function,"""" and changes in mental abilities, sleeping patterns, and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?  Trump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

We can know his motives about it being a Muslim ban. He has said it was. b. He lied about the physical size of his inauguration crowd - you diverted to viewership.  Again, this about him being a pathological liar. When he makes claims in speeches, Facebook, or Twitter very often he states blatant lies or makes entirely baseless hearsay claims. I am wondering if you have the ability to understand what a fact is or isn't. Scary.  2. To this most recent statement what are you even trying to say? You must submit to his ideas while still holding your own, also federal law is a thing? You're not even making sense.  President Trump is not the law. He too must submit to the law. That is why a 'muslim ban' is illegal the same way murder is illegal. Neither I or him can break the law. Doesn't matter what we agree or disagree on.

A lot of this wealth ends up untaxed and moved offshore to tax havens for these wealthy families. The fact that the CRA doesn't publicize any of the wealthy Canadians involved with the recent KMPG and Panama Papers offshore tax havens likely indicates many wealthy Canadian families and political figures are involved.

Well, duh,  ...because firing the FBI director is the president’s job. That would be the reason that Donald Trump dispatched his pal Keith to drop a note on James Comey’s desk letting him know he was fired—while Comey was out of town. Sessions’ only contribution to the affair was designating Rod Rosenstein to write Trump an excuse—one that Trump would, of course, throw away the first time he got in front of a camera to brag that instead, he had fired Comey over the Russia investigation. Andrew McCabe became the acting director of the FBI when Trump fired Comey. So who put Andrew McCabe in charge of the FBI? Donald Trump did. Trump, buffoon extraordinaire. And a traitorous buffoon.

0,"Trump is using classic """"divide and conquer"""" tactics. He is ripping up every multi-lateral trade agreement and then going to each individual country to negotiate a separate trade agreement where the smaller country stands alone rather than together with the others. Trump just said that he wants bilateral agreements with each country and if they don't agree to his demands they will get an even worse agreement if they come back a second time. The only recourse in this situation is for the smaller countries to band together and say no. If Trump does anything against one of them they all collectively have to take punitive trade measures against the US in response. That is the only way pain can be inflicted on the US in proportion. Obviously this seems extremely difficult to do but if Trump is not opposed he will keep coming back for more and it will be virtually impossible to undo the one-sided agreements he seeks. Trump has to be stopped before he gets this train rolling to disaster.

The Trumpists are using the flag in a transparent attempt at legitimizing their racist viewpoints, nationalistic fervor, and the bizarre, blind faith they place in the most incompetent excuse for a president that this nation has seen in recent history.  Their message is: If you disagree with the Trumpster you're not patriotic. If you have a different point of view from us, you're not patriotic, because we are the only patriots here. See? We're wearing, and waving the American flag, which proves we're for America, and you're not.  Yes, MW, it's very telling.

Both cannot gather dust together.  Sad, does not cover the willing lose of integrity.  Self respect soon follows, and worse it carries on a lifelong ever burdensome weight, readily observable.

But the fact he boasted in public undoes their efforts as does the subsequent announcement that Syrian Christians will be exempt from the ban.  The Executive cannot question the authority a member of the Judiciary. Each of the three branches must respect the others. Sure, the President can file for a stay of the TRO, but the fact the President fired the acting AG Yates for saying the ban was unlawful will weaken his case. And don't expect judges to be flexible toward an administration that holds the Judiciary in contempt.

I don't believe I'm being partisan when I say I believe this still should matter.  There has been an attempt by pundits and Republicans (Ryan, among them) to claim Trump has a mandate. This claim flies in the face of the vote count.  The fact will remain more preferred Clinton and her vision for the future than Trump's. This is why, I believe, the vote count matter. Yet, your response does not give any value to the vote count. I think that is a mistake. Are you saying that, because we are a Republic, rather than a Democracy, the vote count has no meaning at all?  When this happened in '2000, W, Cheney and the Republicans did not consider the value of the vote count. Sadly, I doubt it will be any different this time.

This is a key issue in the information technology field and for post-secondary educators.  It follows that Canada, along with other countries, will be well placed to attract (a) individuals and branch facilities for US companies to continue to employ such individuals and (b) skilled professors and researchers at the university and community college level as many in this pool of Green Card holders seek to relocate (and companies seek to retain the skills of these individuals by enlarging operations outside the US where they can be employed in the future while universities and colleges gain by having a larger pool from which to recruite.

Although Trump proposes cutting the top personal income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%, lowering the corporate rate to 25% means that the very wealthy will set up pass-through corporations that effectively lower their tax rate from 39.6% to 25%.

Moreover, I don't think the Liberals would be so foolish as to abrogate free trade with the United States because the Trump leaves an agreement with Mexico.

0,"Trump is absolutely correct on this. This is not a time for a president to rule by fiat. The republicans have to stop bowing to business who wants cheap labor, the democrats need to stop working toward legalizing a whole new block of democrat voters.  Give the dreamers in school educational visas. Give the dreamers who have jobs labor visas. Without a job (reasonable time frame) or school, well we should deport them. Educational and labor visas should not have a path to citizenship. It's an unnecessary political aim.

Thirty years later he is the President Elect of the United States and Spy magazine is no more. According to “Trump Revealed” (p.114) Trump “told the News’ Liz Smith [in September 1988] that Spy would close in a year; Spy embraced the prediction and added a monthly feature: a countdown to its own extinction…Trump’s prediction of Spy’s demise eventually proved right; the magazine briefly folded in 1994, then closed for good in 1998.” Trump was only out by four years in predicting that Spy would close, as he never said it wouldn’t reopen again. No-one knows who will lose their job first, Trump as POTUS or La Renzetti as Globe typist. However if I were a betting man I would bet that La Renzetti is gone from the Globe before Trump leaves the White House.

Then he did his best to undermine NATO on his recent trip to Europe as well as supporting Brexit.  Russia's number one goal since the end of WWII has been to bust up NATO and the EU. Trump is helping Putin realize those goals. Now he's withdrawing from the Paris Accord, and leaving the Chinese to assume the role of world leadership on climate change.

This is not a budget it a talking point list for the Trumptards.  Trump promised to end the national debt. This budget reduces spending over a ten year period. It does nothing towards the reduction of the national debt as the annual interest grows more than the annual saving in this budget.

All the polling said it was going to pass .Then hard liners started calling everyone who disagreed with the issue names , and they then lost the election.  Young always wins because democrats always send losers to run against him . Sullivan won because Begich was Obama's right hand man. In both cases the losers supporters name calling was a factor in the outcome. Not the deciding factor but a factor just the same.The only time name calling has worked was with Trump.He won despite the name calling because voters were fed up with traditional politicians AND Hillary Clinton was considered by many American's to be untrustworthy , dishonest , and someone who should be locked up.

0,"We have to wait and see how much Trump increases the National Debt when he leaves office but not include programs from prior years from Congress and Obama. Here is what Obama's programs added to the National Deb during his term: 1- Obama Tax Cuts $858 Billion, 2-The American Recovery Act (Stimulus) Tax cuts, extensions of unemployment, public works, $787 Billion, 3- Increases in Military Spending $800 Billion, 4- War on Terror $857 Billion, 5- Obamacare $104 Billion. So a grand total from 2009 to 2017 of $983 Billion increase in the debt. This is from a Wall Street Journal, article by Ezra Klein and others, and from a related article by The Balance. Obama's spending was reduced by a small amount by the sequestration cuts agreed to by the Republicans and Obama. Obama's spending was also reduced by a Republican Congress. When we tally Trump in the future, we need to look the same way at what his programs and cuts did and not the programs of Obama, other Presidents and Congress.

The economy moves in short cycles but long-term trends, such as the reduction of people in the workforce, are more important. Likewise it's hard to accept low inflation figures when you checkout at the supermarket.  It's hard for working-class people to trust happy talk from the """"experts"""" when we're struggling to get by. The upper middle-class professional experts are doing well, but we are not.

I do not excuse Trump saying he wanted to grab women by the genitals that is not something a man does. It is something a perv does.  Basically what I got from this rambling was that lying is okay because people lie. I want a president that is better than me. I want someone to look up to as the president.  What I have now is a molester in chief that has been lying left and right to everyone, and when confronted blames it on the previous admin.  """"but he tells the truth about how he feels which is more then most people do """" Really Trump doesn't lie he just says how he feels even though it is a lie. 3 million illegals voting, no russia connection to admin, repeal obamacare, use of american steel in the pipeline, I could keep going but I think you get the idea.

0,"Trump is retaliating against sanctuary cities because they are not doing what he wants.  Trump wants to deport all undocumented immigrants, including those who have no criminal records.  The U.S. immigration system is broken.  There have been attempts to fix it, but none have been successful.  Two-thirds of all adult undocumented immigrants have been living in the U.S. for 10 years or more and have married U.S. citizens and/or have children who are U.S. citizens by birth.  Immigration is a federal function, but Trump wants to use local police to assist federal immigration enforcement agencies.  That would make our communities less safe because undocumented immigrants would be reluctant to report crimes and suspected crimes to the police, and they would be reluctant to come forth as witnesses to crimes due to the threat of deportation.  That makes everyone in our communities less safe. As has happened in California, Hawaii's legislature should pass a law making Hawaii a sanctuary state.

McMasters explained why they could not distinguish classified from unclassified-- he said Trump could not know because the information was both classified and unclassified and Trump could not tell the difference because he was not briefed.

How about his trying to partner with Russia in working with Iran, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and the Kurds in a policy for Syria once ISIS is expelled. These are things Trump would not have done during his anti-globalist period during the campaign and right after he was elected. His policies on North Korea (trying to work with Russia and China), and world trade are now recognizing that we cannot go it alone.

0,"Make no mistake folks this is what repealing the ACA is all about. And this is just the beginning of the GOP program of massive tax cuts for the wealthy made up by higher taxes on the middle class. Not what trump promised now is it?  """"Released Thursday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), the publication shows that the repeal would give to each of the top 400 highest-income taxpayers—who averaged incomes of roughly $318 million in 2014—a tax cut of about $7 million a year.  That's because getting rid of the healthcare law would mean getting rid of its two Medicare taxes, which are paid for by individuals with incomes above $200,000 and couples with incomes above $250,000. One is a 3.8 percent Medicare tax that hits their unearned income (like capital gains) above those thresholds, while the other is additional 0.9 percent tax on earned income above those thresholds.  As such, a repeal """"delivers tax cuts that are extremely tilted to the top,"""" the report states.""""

In another two Trump can be voted out. There are many people like myself who will hold Trump accountable we are not sheep being led to the slaughter.

Yes, there are some tough issued to be addressed by Congress in its fix such as what to do with those who have served or are now serving in the armed forces.  However, there is a much bigger issue and that is what to do with the one or two million parents and non-DACA siblings of DACA immigrants.  If immigrants covered by DACA are allowed to stay, Democrats and illegal immigrant advocates will demand they also be allowed to stay.  I believe that will be called amnesty.

One that Trump tried to get him to drop the investigation into Flynn's ties to Russia, which would be obstruction of justice if proven. Hopefully Trump does have the tapes he threatened Comey with. The second thing is that Comey repeated unequivocally that Russia did interfere with the American election, something that Trump trolls continue to try to deny. And also something Trump showed no concern about. Not a single question about a foreign nation sabotaging their democracy. We now await the results of the rest of the investigation to see to what extent, if any, the Trump team colluded with the Russians, which would be treason. It ain't over by a long shot, trolls.

Regarding SNAP, George W Bush added 14.7 million SNAP users during his 2 terms and Obama added 13.4 million. Regarding the stock market, during Obama's first 100 days the stock market rose 8.4% compared to Trumps 5.5%. When Obama took office the DJIA was 7,949 and when he left it was 19,887 and on one day, August 14, 2017, all three major stock market indexes set records.

EMPLOYMENT, the number of Americans actually working, has, under Obama, steadily climbing. Simply, there is no objective evidence that a social safety net discourages work. None, at all. Yes, raising the minimum wage may increase the cost of goods--- so feel free, as a consumer, not to buy them. But also know that for the hundreds of thousands that now have more wages, they will be increasing THEIR purchasing power. They, of course, will need less government assistance. It's obvious that the poor and middle-class have remained stagnant while the wealthy have become ridiculously more so. I guess you're okay with that. Trickle-down worked for you, I guess.

0,"I think every President prefers to use economic pressure and negotiations to get NK to stop its nuclear weapons program rather than go to war and risk destruction in the region and the loss of thousands of South Korean, Japanese, and US lives. Apart from the rhetoric, Trump is no different and the fact that Trump is not seriously preparing an attack and is struggling mightily to impose economic sanctions and get North Korea into negotiations tells you this. We have successfully negotiated arrangements for countries to stop or reduce their nuclear arms programs-- the most recent being with Iran. If Trump cannot negotiate the sanctions and an arrangement with NK, then he needs to bring in someone who can. If we have to attack to get our way, then that will be a huge failure.

0,"The trick is to tune him out and not let Trump get under your skin.  You are right...even with the Republicans controlling all 3 branches of government, next to nothing is getting passed.  That should tell you he's all rhetoric and not much for action.  He has the ability to contradict himself from day to day and not think twice about it.  So why would anyone take what he says on any given day seriously?  As you say, many states are just ignoring him.   Much of the world has too.  Just smile and carry on with your normal business.  Fact is, Trump is much less dangerous than Trudeau, who plays the PR game well but whose policies and practices are very damaging to the country.  I would rather have a blow-hard narcissist like Trump who few take seriously than a media-friendly narcissist who smiles for selfies while effecting serious damage.

In other countries we fund direct military aid, led by the $3.8 Billion we pay annually to Israel which Trump and others hope will balance our approach to the Saudis and forge an anti-Iranian and anti-ISIL alliance between the two countries.  Trump reaches out to strike ISIS overseas and this will benefit us domestically where we need the same approach.

0,"I'm not sure you understand how the United States government works. The President doesn't wield unyielding power. In fact, the Executive Office is supposed to work in conjunction with Congress and the Supreme Court to ensure a system of checks and balances. Yes the President can issue Executive Orders but they are done so in the fashion of directing a part of the Executive Branch on how to operate. Now Congress and especially the Supreme Court can declare orders unconstitutional or override them with new laws, and Executive Orders cannot override laws enacted by Congress.  So in any case the government operates by way of a system of checks and balances, with each branch having different types of power, all holding each other in check. What Trump has done, however, is impose his will by way of ousting opposition in the Executive Office and surrounding himself with his cronies. He's running close to a dictatorship, and that is awfully scary.

I'm proud of our intolerance. It's what has pushed our country past our dark history and into modern times.

The terrorist hit a police officer hard with his vehicle with the intent to kill him.  The terrorist then got out of his vehicle and stabbed the police officer repeatedly.  The officer, in spite of his injuries, struggled on the ground with the terrorist and was able to subdue him, until weakened by injury allowing the terrorist to escape.  The Edmonton police went on full alert. A while later, a police office stopped a suspicious looking  moving van which ended up to be the terrorist, who then sped off with the van and trailer attached, attempting to run down pedestrians.  He was prevented, again, from causing carnage by a swarm of police cars that blocked him off. An act of mass murder prevented by the stellar work of the Edmonton City Police.

0,"No Richard, K McIntyre has it right. The difference and escalation are that the Clinton hacks were leaked to the press via wikileaks deliberately and successfully to damage that candidate nationally, while the compromising material on Trump stayed secret. The important difference is that it was put out there where everyone could see it, and it affected the election. It's somewhat important that people like James Comey talked about re-opening the investigation publicly when (a) it shouldn't have been re-opened (b) he shouldn't discuss ongoing investigations  and (c) he was breaking the law by doing it so close to the election. But NO, what is important and an escalation IS NOT THE MEDIA TALKING about this. That """"blame the media"""" line is such tired crap. It is the intelligence services that escalated by publicly perverting the US presidential election. That is the key escalation, unseen by the public before. OF COURSE we talk about it, that's NOT the difference its a result.

From what I can surmise, they're basically sides of the same coin and will do the bidding of developers, the police departments, banks, and business owners while going through the motions of supporting programs that actually impact the social problems that affect us all in the community. No one has offered up any imaginative ideas/details as part of their platforms or in their appearances - pretty vanilla candidates.

Iran is no human rights paradise, but President Rouhani - recently re-elected with an overwhelming majority - is slowly but steadily moving the country towards a democratic secular condition, though with great resistance from the conservative institutions of the Supreme Leader (Khamenei), the Guardian Council and the Revolutionary Guard.  No such progress is seen in Saudi Arabia.  So why would Donald Trump double down on support for Saudi Arabia and crank up the anti-Iran rhetoric?  Rouhani should be encouraged, not demonized.  Now is the time for the west to reach out to Iran and seek to influence its institutions in positive ways, not give them the back of the hand.  The hypocrisy of the West's relationship with the Saudi regime is apparent and, as Iran becomes more progressive while the Sauds remain repressive, our relationship with the Sauds becomes ethically untenable.  .

While the media feels the need to “binge eat Oreos and Hostess cakes” Trump is working to get them made in America again.  Be fair, Trump is protecting American workers and reaffirming the absolute, Constitutionally guaranteed rights of Americans including the second, and first amendments.  It is not Trump who is the antithesis of freedom, it is teachers who believe that they must indoctrinate students instead of educating them. That is why our constitutionally guaranteed rights have been diminished and redefined. That is why students in a Political Science class do not know about the constitution or judicial overreach.

0,"No Alexandra, I do not equate illegal immigration with the demise of the middle class.  I DO, however, that there is a lot more fear driving this round of populism from that middle class than we might expect in a more traditional populist movement.  I suspect that the many issues swirling around immigration will be a part of those fears for many.  As to Trump's team scrapping regulations, how is that all that """"new"""" in American politics?  Obama's team ADDED a bunch of regulations, which is no more uncommon for democrats, than is a republican president who tries to cut back on regulation.  That cycle is akin to a political pendulum, and though any given cycle, I might not personally like or agree with a given president/party, I AM comfortable with the overall flow of this: it's worked now for a long time...  YOU may not hear anyone saying """"let's do away with all laws,"""" but I'm guessing actions like sanctuary cities (and similar stuff) is seen as a bold step in that direction by many.

Whether it's democratic or totalitarian, the USA will topple a foreign government that isn't sufficiently friendly to those interests. Likewise, the USA will tolerate the worst abuses by a foreign government that plays ball with Washington.

0,"Very informative article. But biased as usual. But you left out some facts. These test did not begin this year.  These test were also conducted when Obama was president, although he totally ignored such.  You are right in the fact the sanctions will do little, as Kim has used the money Clinton gave him to stop the path to a atom bomb. to develop these weapons.  And, as there were Iranian observers at the nuclear tests, he has gotten some of the billions Obama gave Iran. He has sold missles to Iran and regretably maybe his nuclear bombs. Even though this is a slap at Trump, it is under his direction these negotioations are occurring.  Trump insanity?  I think it was more insane for Clinton to guarantee Korea billions or Obama to ignore the weapon test.  Without their insanity we wouldn't be where we are today.

There was miscommunication and the Whitehouse and Trump broke the Vinson sailing story too soon before the Vinson's sailing was determined. Mattis was still working details on the timing and whether the Vincent was leaving Australia before completing a training exercise. Usually this kind of news would be handled by a Pentagon information source, but Trump does not have one yet so Mattis got assigned. The Navy prepared for the sail, but they did not view it as anymore than the Vinson's normal movement in the region. The Vinson would need more missile launching destroyers than one, and at least one other carrier for any preemptive strike on North Korea. The carrier Ronald Reagan was stuck in maintenance in Yokosuka. The carrier Nimitz was undergoing major work and testing off San Diego and not available.

It did not matter that most of it was based on innuendo and fantasy. I expected Fox News and other right media to carry water for them, but it's really upsetting that the mainstream media did, too.

0,"I am not sure how this will be implemented.  The main failure of this initiative is that there is not enough detail in what is being proposed. The BC carbon tax seems to have worked OK (?). The economy as a whole will see no change unless the tax revenue is saved or leaves the country. Governments need revenues to pay for necessary benefits such as public education and health care. These will paid for whether with government taxes (deficits) or private fees. How will the carbon tax work with the existing tax structure? Infrastructure spending needs funds. If we need infrastructure we also need a source of funds to pay for it. These are new expenditures so a new tax would seem to be required. Maybe we don't need new infrastructure, i. e. gridlock forever.  BTW Trump proposes infrastructure spending and without new taxes. Maybe a carbon tax would make sense if he does what he has proposed.

Only problem is, the MORON forgets how MANY times he lot elections until, unbelievably, he wins the Presidential election on the 4th or 5th try !!! Scary thing is, Moron lost as a Democrat, so he changes to Republican and WINS !!!  What does THAT say about the Republican Party. I've been a card carrying Republican since I graduated rom college, but THIS Republican Party is NOT the party I grew into as a voting adult !!! This Party is a shameful, bigoted, mysogonistic, Constitutional violator, incestuous, backwards looing, bunch of fools who cower in fear of the Moron President !!!

They came to this country under entirely different circumstances.  The African-American experience was that of over two centuries of slavery that destroyed the family and then a century of non-voting laboring poor.  The recent Asian groups you refer to weren't slaves or barred from voting when the became citizens.  There were also no laws baring them from attending school or learning to read.

Trump thinks the plane is a luxury, when in fact it's a necessity.     As much as I dislike Trump - as President, he shouldn't be flying in a regular plane - it's too risky.       He'll just have to live without the gold fixtures and red velvet and crystal.    He can still be a member of the mile high club in Air Force One - that's probably all he really cares about.

He's about trying to rectify trade agreements that have resulted in massive numbers of good jobs leaving and the middle class disappearing while at the same time the rich and society/political elites stuff their pockets full.  He believes in investing in health care, education and infrastructure so that we can at least try to play catch up to countries that have left us in their dust.  And for the first time in a very long time he seems to be providing political leadership that delivers on campaign promises.  Wake up people.  Trump is a good thing.

0,"When Trump was elected I knew he will start a war somewhere. But where? So many enemies, so many opportunities. We now know Trump have decided to start Korean War 2.  NK was barred by UN Security Council from making nuclear and other WMD weapons. But not anything else. Because any country has rights of self-defense and can make any weapon systems as long as its not nuclear or chemical/bio. So NK violated no international laws. It did not fire a shot to South. The thing about Trump is he does not care about laws or authorization. He will start Korean War 2 and that's that. He figures carriers, subs and missiles will do the trick. Winning the war will make him famous, unchallenged, outdo Truman and all presidents since. It will make him great.  So I say let Korean War 2 start. It will engulf the entire Korea peninsula, kill millions. Trump can watch the show in Florida sipping wine. If he wins he become the greatest president since WW2 in his mind. If he lose, well restart Cold War 2.

They never threw out any """"data"""" to support their words to me. The city of Anchorage just recently admitted that they had been reading their """"data"""" incorrectly, and that indeed, there has been a recent up-tick in certain types of crime.

0,"For another perspective that generally corroborates the story, the Guardian recently ran a well-referenced article describing the vast tax fraud that Magnitsky uncovered that stole $230m from the Russian treasury.  The Guardian article links to US court documents that accuse Denis Katsyv and a company named Prevezon of laundering the proceeds of that fraud through various transactions including a Manhattan real estate deal with Jared Kushner.  Natalia Veselnitskaya is a Russian lawyer who participated in the meeting at Trump Towers with Kushner, Donald Trump Jr, and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. As the Guardian notes Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon in the money laundering case and is also known as a lobbyist against the Magnitsky sanctions which featured as a subject discussed in that meeting.

Some models of vehicles trade about within the auto industry but that wouldn't count.  I can't see what Canadians are concerned about at this stage.  If Donald Trump concentrates on his Mexican wall and border fee, (is this a tariff or a cost of crossing through a wall at the border) initially, why can't we wait until something else happens, if anything?  The media are trying to make this a major issue, when for us it may not be.  Mexico is not Canada.

It was during this period of time that the US, for better or worse, was able to finance their part of the Cold War (for example, developing and producing new fighter aircraft on a nearly yearly basis).  Programs that actually benefited their population, such as expanded Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, were created and funded.  They even managed to build a national highway system (total cost around $500B).  So how does Trump, or any of the other national politicians, think that they can come anywhere close to making """"America Great Again"""", when they have already reduced taxes to the point that they can't adequately fund their global conquest efforts let alone actually repair a bridge somewhere in the actual US or fund """"Meals on Wheels""""?

1,"<<Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States . . .>> That is the policy Trump articulated in December 2015. He has never renounced it, withdrawn it, or modified it. He's a bigot, and in his heart of hearts, he's proud of it; he wants us all to know that he's a bigot. Why else would he bring Steve Bannon and a cabal of neo-Nazis into the White House? Trump has told us, personally and through his surrogates (Giuliani, Gingrich, Miller), that the Executive Order is intended to get as close as they can to delivering on the """"total and complete"""" Muslim ban Trump proposed in 2015. Trump is a bigot. He's looking for a way to ban Muslims.  The executive order doesn't go as far as Trump and his fellow-travelers want to go, but by their dark lights, it's a start.  It is intellectually dishonest to refer to the executive order as a """"travel ban.""""  It's a Muslim ban.

It won't be Trump.  Afghanistan was not just about revenge.  It was about trying to change their society in terms of how women are treated.  Lest we forget, the Taliban drove a modernizing country backwards.  A better way to help women is to give any woman or girl who wants to leave immediate US residency.  At some point, the men will start behaving themselves.  Than answer is border change, by the way.

This was there since Washington who did not sell his lands and became extremely wealthy after massive infrastructure developments he undertook made his real estate more valuable.   However Trump faces the moral quandary though legally there is nothing stopping him.  That's why he can do whatever he wants and everyone else gets to wring their hands and pound sand.  He will do something and yes his family can do anything they want.   At least he didn't make his brother AG like that JFK did.  RFK was a great AG though.  (c) That's a tough one to prove.

A GOP Icon, once its nominee for President, who COULD fade quietly with his GOP Icon status intact (like, for instance, Orin Hatch is ultimately doing, and that utter wimp McConnell is refining into a political doctrine).

I further understand that Congressional Republicans are probably hopelessly enamored with stealing from the poor and giving to the rich, so they will be no help in the war.

I don't agree with/like Trump but he won 39 states, and 85% of the counties of the USA.  The Democrats pushed their vote % in places like Philadelphia...winning a seat with 90% of the vote, counts the same as 51%.  Canada? You could win 175 seats (majority) crafted from the lowest population seats, and only get say 40% of the vote in each. Simple math says that you could fashion a """"majority"""" government from something like 17% of the votes cast.  (say the bottom 175 in pop have around 40% of the total pop, and you win each of those seats  with 40% of the votes cast - 40% being a typical win in a 3+ candidate riding. Voila - a 16 - 17% """"majority"""". In fact, even today, take out the seats a government doesn't win, they are ruling with a small % of the votes cast - even far less than the sub - 40% majorities Canada typically gets. )

0,"Far from """"draining the swamp"""", Trump has filled the swamp with the greediest rats he could find, he being himself the greediest and most corrupt of the bunch. He has a stable base of support, but even that is showing signs of erosion in the latest polls. More troubling, at this point, most Republican office holders still seem willing to tolerate his corruption, incompetence and instability in the hope that they will pass and he will sign a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of wealth-holders under the guise of a """"tax cut"""" or """"tax reform."""" 80% of the money saved in tax cuts will go to the top 1%, while the deficit-hypocrites will gleefully (but as quietly as they can) allow the deficit to increase in order to move that money to the very top. Despicable. In many ways, Pence will be worse. Trump built his political career on the racist theory of birtherism; Pence built his, to a great extent, on gay-bashing. Worse, as an enabler of Trump, he has demonstrated no integrity.

Trump's focus in on negotiation and getting the best deal for his country.  The US has waived a lot of reciprocal benefits either for political expediency or PR value.  This was enabled by rapidly rising wealth after the war, and lately, through taking on incredible debt that can't be paid back,  At least Trump is trying to plug the leaks in all this unrequited largess, both foreign and domestic.

You said “What makes you think that? If you are a terrorist, then chances are extreme vetting-- employed by Obama and Trump-- will block you.”  You threw in Obama. The point I made is that Scuddrunner is right; it is possible for a U.S. citizen or legal resident intent on committing acts of terrorism in the U.S. to bring in a “fiancé” accomplice from any country using the K-1 visa program.  With same sex marriage now authorized in the U.S., “fiancés” can be of the same sex as the petitioner, which makes vetting a bit more difficult.  A same sex fiancé from a Muslim country should wave a red flag in the vetting process, but I would not count on it.

Even among those voted Trump there are no doubt many who'd like to have their time back. Many voted in a fit of pique - spurred on by an incompetent press, an unpopular Democratic nominee, an inept (or worse) FBI, a foreign scheme to derail American democracy, and a deep contempt for the political establishment among blue collar workers. The sad part is that the very people responsible for his ascendancy (the marginalized and disadvantaged) are the most likely to suffer under a Trump presidency.  Change can be good; upheaval less so.

It did not conclude that there was bias or that media coverage was negatively slanted; instead, the Harvard study concluded that there was more negative coverage because the bad news pours out of the White House at an unprecedented rate. Here are the report's exact words: """"The fact that Trump has received more negative coverage than his predecessor is hardly surprising. The early days of his presidency have been marked by far more missteps and miss-hits, often self-inflicted, than any presidency in memory, perhaps ever.""""

1,"Trump is a self confessed cowardly criminal draft dodger.  All of us Trump's age (born in 1946) had to deal with the call by our country to serve.  There was no active resistance to the draft in 1964-5 when most of us were called in for our physical, no well publicized expose of the war. In fact U.S. soldiers were just advisors in Vietnam. So Trump the pampered son of privilege was too scared and cowardly to join the service. Many were sent to Europe, Japan or Korea.  Many more served their two year hitch in the states. His odds for a duty that might require courage were very low. Still he had to commit fraud to better the odds.  How will this cowardly bully manage the military?  He won't.  No self respecting soldier would follow a cowards orders.  His behavior with regard to the draft is grounds for immediate impeachment if we have the votes.  In two years we must have the votes in congress to bring a bill of impeachment.  In the meantime Boycott Trump wherever you see the name.

0,"While I don't believe that Comey was fired for any of the reasons you mentioned, you might want to give your own theory a reality check.  Firing Comey changes nothing about the FBI's investigation. That's because the FBI's activities are under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department, not the president. (He just appoints or fires the FBI director.) The FBI also reports to the National Intelligence Committee, not the president. Additionally, there are a good number of other security agencies involved, such as the CIA, NSA, HS and so forth. They too report to the National Intelligence Committee.  It would require a mass conspiracy on the part of all the US security agencies to suppress the truth in this case. And I don't think any president has that kind of political power, let alone Trump. Firing Comey will make no difference to the outcome of the investigation. Aside from that, Comey deserved to be fired for his meddling in the US presidential election.

It is very distressing that those in the state Dept of Agriculture and the state Dept of Health have not made this information known to the general public. When people learn how important it is to eat only wild caught fish and locally farm raised fish, they will vote with their wallets and the import of farmed fish from the Third World will diminish or end completely.  One of the damming things about the Trans Pacific Partnership Trade agreement was that it made it impossible for consumers to know where the food stuffs came from as the labeling of country of origin was not allowed. Good thing the Trumpster axed the agreement which had been agreed by by Obammers.

Or, to put that more simply, you do not believe in individual freedom.  You display quite remarkable arrogance in your insistence that other people live their lives according your moral beliefs. You oppose same-sex civil marriage, even though it does not actually affect you in the slightest. You just assume that it is your business to poke your nose into other people's private lives. As I said, arrogance.  Your statement that there were few back-alley abortions is simply wrong.

You talk about social justice all the time, so why not do your part to actually set the record straight, especially since you’ve had a hand in disseminating all those feathers in the wind.  Admit it; the Trump dossier was a complete fabrication, brought about via collusion, and if jail and impeachment were a good idea for team Trump had any of that nonsense been true, then why shouldn’t team Clinton face the same Justice?

She was there for all of it and never, ever pushed for what Bernie Saunders is pushing for. Am glad for more women in politics but one of the reasons she didn't win (and why Voldemort did) is because many left-leaning persons sat on their hands for that vote. Hillary's politics-as-usual are part of the problem in the States, and the gender issue, while important, should not obscure other factors like class and the political influence of the uber wealthy. Clinton works on behalf of the rich as much as Trump does.

And Trump has agreed to increase military support for the Saudi's in their two year old war in Yemen-- the support requested by Prince Mohamed during his visit to the Whitehouse three weeks ago. He has spoken out against Iran. Most of these are things that Trump has come to recently and Trump's far right supporters, like Jack Posobiec Director of Citizens for Trump very angry about the change (he has stopped backing Trump) and like Ann Coulter author of """"In Trump We Trust""""-- you can find stories on this on far right sites like Infowars.

Even St. Paul called himself the chief of sinners, and I am certainly no better than St. Paul. But, that is beside the point.  If we roll out and take a long look at the big picture, the issue here is whether a Christian church can continue to hold to its doctrine in an age when doctrines repugnant to the Christian Tradition are being enshrined into law an imposed on them. The corollary issue is whether adherents to that religion can gather together with a common commitment to those doctrines in the midst of an increasingly hostile society.  Homosexual """"marriage"""" may be statutory law, but it has never been and can never be canon law. Since Christians consider their true citizenship to be in heaven, for us the laws of God trump the laws of Caesar. The benefit of that fact to society is that the laws of God, as understood by the Christian Church from the Holy Scriptures and Tradition, are good.

He presents as a megalomaniac, full of """"self-exaltation, passion for big things"""" (OED): """"I know more about ISIS than the generals... Only I can fix it,"""" etc. He claims to be the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac: """"When I see them I just can't help myself... when you're famous they just let you do it""""  The more general meaning of """"maniac"""" is someone who engages in wild, reckless, dangerous behaviour, like a maniac driver. China is a significant adversary, yet within days Trump unnecessarily pokes the Chinese on a matter of great sensitivity to them, Taiwan. The US needs support from the people of Iraq yet he has said repeatedly that the US should have taken the oil before leaving and if the opportunity should arise, the should not miss the opportunity to do so.  It is not uncivil to call a spade a spade when there is abundant evidence.

This past week Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era executive action that shielded around 800,000 young undocumented immigrants – often called Dreamers – from deportation under what’s been known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Look at other of Trump’s recent policy decisions and you see the same arbitrary and unnecessary cruelty. What’s the point of banning transgender people from military service? Of siding in court with a businessman who doesn’t want to sell his services to gay couples? Of weakening the standard for responding to sexual violence in universities? Of banning Syrian refugees and reducing by half the number of refugees admitted to the United States? There is no point, in terms of policy. None of these decisions makes America safer or economically stronger or fairer.

For example, he was furious that Notre Dame did not invite Trump to speak at their graduation saying that they passed on an opportunity for Trump to explain how his thinking on abortion has evolved.  Seriously?  And would that be followed by a talk on the sanctity of marriage from the thrice-married president?

If this investigation were to unearth evidence, for instance, that called into question Trump's conduct, whether post Jan 20th or en route to his becoming POTUS, surely those findings would reverberate down the line, possibly with implications for his actions while in office (executive orders, nominations, etc.).  While I'm not well versed on the legal arguments, it seems to me that the Gorsuch nomination could, in the above scenario, be construed as a kind of fruit of the poisonous tree. I’d be interested to hear more about precedent on this.  Hence, the idea of postponement.

Since the goal of terrorism is to provoke a response that will do more damage to the targeted nation itself than the actual terrorist act did, and since we have a president who is easily provoked into childish behavior who now sits atop the mightiest nation in the world, a nation terrorist groups would love to knock down a few notches, it's safe to assume that it's only a matter of time before a Trump property is hit.

There would have been no wait lists in the Phoenix VA, McCains hometown VA, if they had been adequately funded to be able to hire more clerks as well as healthcare providers. Sanders got McCain to come on board as cosponsor of essentially the same bill just to get some of the recalcitrant  Republican senators on board. Why didn't McCain of all people know what was happening at the Phoenix VA do you suppose? Murkowski, Sullivan and Young endorsed the odious Trump even after he called Mexicans rapists and murderers, proposed a ban on all Muslims coming to America and then more recently the claim that a judge could not be trusted to preside over a fair trial because he was of Mexican heritage though born in America to parents who came here before Drumpf's parents did. Lisa is in a very difficult position made worse by her fealty to party over country.

Lynch orders Comey not to refer to the investigation as an investigation and does not recuse herself. Nothing to see here.

0,"I think the point about Trump loving the chaos engulfing the White House deserves more attention. Much like Gion Ghomeshi's tenure at Q, Trump actually purposely creates conflict within his staff because it helps fulfill his insatiable need to be revered. He wants to see subordinates fighting each other for his favour. It feeds him. It's what narcissists do. What they are uncontrollably compelled to do.  The serial outrages of Trump's presidency make keeping perspective very difficult. His punkish taunting of the Attorney General stands out though, because belittling the head law enforcement official in the land for putting fealty to justice ahead of personal loyalty to the person inhabiting the White House is not only despicable, it completely undermines the entire concept of the rule of law.

0,"When the Klan and the Nazis are thanking the president, you've done something wrong.  These groups have a long history of hate and violence,  the videos show us images that if they were made black and white they could be mistaken for 1930's Germany.  THEN the president states that some Nazis and Klansmen are """"fine people""""?     These aren't a collection of history professors protesting the take down of this statue these are known hate groups.    Then Trump equates George Washington and Thomas Jefferson founders and presidents of this country to Generals that were fighting to destroy this country as equal?  So yes Trump repudiated them but along with the rest of the presser he negated that repudiation and in fact solidified he's a racist.  If he recovers from this it will only show how low we have fallen as a country.

0,"Give it a break, Obama 8 years of  inaction are now Trumps mess to clean up., how the left wing Marxist  dribbles on mindlessly as true action takes place is evidence enough they aren't fit for a lead role. Trump may not be interested in replacing the """"dictato-blimp,"""" but China may be.  Weighing the worth of continuing U.S. trade versus keeping North Korea as an ally, the Chinese may likely prefer the former and might actually consider clandestinely replacing Kim Jong-un with their own puppet.  That way, the Chinese would still keep their boundary between themselves and the West-allied South Korea while effectively bringing North Korea under control.  It's not an entirely pleasant scenario for the North Korean people. However, and hopefully, they may get better treatment under the Chinese than they ever did under the rule of a rogue and despotic family.

0,"Obama has a history of association with anti Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright for over twenty years, members of the Nation of Islam, Al Sharpton, and Reverend Jesse Jackson who calls New York """"Hymie Town"""". Israel knew where they stood with President Obama when he bowed to the waist before the Muslim King of Saudi Arabia like some dhimmi apostate. Also Obama's interference in the Israeli elections (with taxpayer money no less) and his snubbing the Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and collaborating with the figurehead Palestinian leader (Hamas really runs the Palestinians and Iran controls Hamas) adds insult to serious injury. This unprecedented UN snub and backstab from the US by not vetoing the UN condemnation of Israel shows President Obama really is an anti Semite himself.  On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States and Israel will know they can again trust the United States.

Yet, I believe he's one of the Commissioners who led the action for the County Board to support raising the age for purchasing and using tobacco products to twenty-one.  That change would be far more restrictive than banning smoking and vaping in County parks.  Personally, I favor both restrictions.  I find smoking a very unpleasant, intrusive behavior if it's done in the presence of others.  I avoid areas where persons are smoking.  If the County wants to establish """"smoking areaa"""" in the parks,....fine.  However, as the City of Eugene has, I think, found, smokers often """"take over"""" areas such as parks and others don't have the opportunity to enjoy them.  Outsider supports """"personal freedom"""".....great, so do I.  However, the freedom to use a public space w/o breathing someone's cigarette as second-hand smoke is a personal freedom too. One which I feel trumps freedom to smoke.
"
0,"I think the media has done a significant amount to nullify the effect it has on people. There is truly a divide between the people that support Trump and those that don't. Those that support Trump see Hillary as the worst possible thing for America, while those that support Hillary see the same. The Media, in it's attempt to stop Trump, has spun everything to a negative (ex. maternity leave plan just announced). By doing that, the media has undermined itself and clearly shown it's bias. As a result, the people supporting Trump have started to block out the white noise being created by the media, as they expect the media to be bias. As a result, even if the media is spot on, it falls on deaf ears. The media and the backers of the media, have all done this to themselves.  Why not praise Trump when his agenda is something that is good for America. Right now, women are not guaranteed maternity leave. It is a step in the right direction, regardless of what it doesn't do.....

He is a deal maker like the carnival barkers. Or maybe a better scenario is that of a used car dealer selling you a car with the mileage turned back and saw dust in the crank case (or wherever they put it). It is how he makes his deals.

Which, in turn , will set precedence so no other president  will try to undo monuments again in the future. As for the reservation by Obama, they cannot be undone either, the 1953 law does not allow revocation of permanent reservations.

0,"Canadians deserve each other - Canada's growth industries are career activism (Tides, Greenpeace, etc.), public sector unions, and billion dollar apologies... all three sectors are booming! Trust-fund Trudeau and McCain-Morneau are taxing small businesses into early retirement while Trudeau blows $30 billion year on higher expenses with absolutely nothing to show for it. Meanwhile taxpayers are spending $300 million/year on welfare payments alone to support 40,000 illegal migrants who wait an average of 16 months for their hearing - with a 50% success rate, it's hard to blame them. Higher taxes, suffocating bureaucracy for resource sectors, and bloated government unions... Trudeau is a champion of short-sighted naivety and smug unearned entitlement and he would still get another majority if there were an election today. In the unlikely event Trump is successful in tax reform, Canadian businesses will begin to move south overnight and Canada's best and brightest won't be far behind.

Trump knows that this trade plan was designed as a precursor to ram a similar North American Union down our throats as they have done to Europeans. And we know the British have spoken with their vote: goodbye! Hello Brexit.  Trump is not interested in """"renegotiating"""" the slimy deal; he wants to dismantle it and look at fair trade policies.  Interesting reading Trudeau's comments are: acknowledging that Trump wants to bolster the middle class with protectionist policies. You remember those?: When full time jobs, pension plans and good benefits were offered on top of living wages to workers in North America?

0,"The poor treatment of the homeless is the same in most of the country. The surge of homelessness is secondary to neoliberal economics and is going to get worse under Clinton or Trump. The non-profit industrial complex was built up to take advantage of the federal grants for homelessness, the admin staff make good money, but constantly claim lack of funds for the homeless. CSS should have been removed from BFS long ago, the city council, Berkowitz and staff are using BS to manipulate the public while going after the homeless. They say nice things, but do bad things. The claims of less homeless people by Obama are false manipulations. All over the county cities have democrat mayors abusing the homeless under the guise of altruism, running them out of camps, telling the public they have services which do not exist. The evidence here is they all can't fit in that filthy, bed bug ridden bullying BFS where drunks and noise keep people, especially the women from sleeping.

0,"Strange, I didn't read anything about the NRA, which you apparently know nothing about. The NRA promotes the safe individual use of firearms, not lawlessness and recklessness. And it fiercely defends one of our civil rights. It's interesting that those on the left would willingly surrender some of our civil rights, while others on the right would surrender others. It appears that you would be willing to carve out some First Amendment protections. I expect that a dictator, from either the right or left, would be just fine with that.  The American voters, for better or worse, elected Mr. Trump freely. I believe that many of his cabinet picks are ill-advised and don't bode well for us. But we bestowed that responsibility upon him, and we'll have to live with it for another four years. Maybe we'll learn from the experience, although I'm not optimistic.  Be careful what you wish for. If Mr. Trump does indeed turn his administration into a dictatorship, you may just need the NRA.

Recall that when a reasonable person first hears something, they do not make an instant decision.  They go through a process of gathering information and sorting through it.  A reasonable rational person takes time to come down firmly on a complex issue.  So no reasonable person always thought anything about Iraq.  Eventually, diverse people settled on diverse positions.

0,"BC deserves better than cynical populism from Christy Clark  Facing deteriorating polling numbers and an unfavorable personal rating by the public, Ms. Clark decided to out Trump Trump and it may work by playing on the raw emotions of too many voters.  Lost in all this bravado are several facts that make it highly unlikely that a Clark Government could implement what she is suggesting.  Such bluster now plays at cross purposes at a critical time to Federal negotiations with the US and Mexico over a wide range of trade issues. Implementation by BC would violate several Canadian foreign trade deals and would unconstitutionally interfere with interprovincial trade and commerce. Do BC voters really want each Province to veto interprovincial transportation of goods?  However, all this is outweighed for Ms. Clark because there's a tight election to be won and populist bombast just might tip the balance to the BC Liberals.

0,"I agree and for the same reasons I commented on to the earlier piece. Confirm Judge Gorsuch. His performace at the hearings underlines why. Although I disagree with him on the Hobby Lobby case, one never knows if he really believed what he said or was playing to a future POTUS. At the hearings he sounded as much like Roberts and Alito as Sotomayor or Ginsburg. He will likely vote the same way as all four did on the question of repealing Roe. They won’t and he won’t. Yes, he was appointed by a serial liar and the biggest lie Trump forward was that he was Pro-Life and would appoint Justices of the same cloth as Scalia. My sense is that Gorsuch is more like Justice Kennedy, leaving no one on the Court who accepts the National Right to Life Committee position on overturning abortion, which is that Roe must be overturned.

Burke and his toadies were behind some of the dumb stunts against the pope over the last few weeks like the posters.  I don't think that Burke will be effective nor do I think that Bannon thinks he will (although Bannon wouldn't mind being rid of that meddlesome priest.)

The reason Trump won is that turn-out among urban blacks and other members of the Obama coalition was way down in places where national policies placed them at an especial disadvantage. That turnout was down because the Democratic Party nominated an uninspiring, terribly-flawed, worst-possible candidate - a congenital liar who endangered national security (intentionally and carelessly using an email server less secure than gmail), who refused to take responsibility for her mistakes (e.g. Benghazi) and who had been selling influence to the highest bidder for decades - from Little Rock to Big Banks to Deplorable Foreign Capitals.

The threat of harm to WA's economy was one of the factors considered in the decision. The Trump executive order was also deemed, by the judge, to not be responding to credible threats.
