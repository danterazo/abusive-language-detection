0,"Ibbitson has been wrong about everything. He's an out-of-touch elitist one-percenter who hangs out with the Davos crowd. He has no idea what's going on in his own city, let alone the country.  Conservatives, if you want to win the next election, don't go Trump-lite, go full-on-Trump.  Go with a campaign of """"Canada First"""", jobs and reducing immigration and you'll win in a landslide. Won't even be close.

0,"The worse offenders were and still are, the right wing guys in the clergy and how they used Scripture to justify and continue Trump's inappropriate behavior.  Even Donald Trump, Jr. openly supported his father's words, saying its just guy talk.  All his friends talk like that he says.  How typical for Falwell,  Franklin Graham, et al to remain complicit  with Trump.  He must have donated more than the normal thirty piece of silver to them.  And it gets worse.  All violence does.  Always.  Trump is now on record speaking inappropriately about his own daughter.  That is sick.  Sick.  And the fundamentalists continue their support.  They said he repented.  He didn't.  They said he had a """"Road to Damascus Experience.""""  He didn't.  All predators say they are sorry.  Repeatedly.  The right wing is either channeling Jimmy Swaggart,  the leaders of Sodom and You-Know-Where or Jerry Sandusky.  The Sweet Lord Jesus would NEVER hang with them.  He's the One who said they were Pharisees and liars.

0,"When Trump threatens to do something, the media complains. When Trump backs down, they then say he's not meeting his election promises. There is no pleasing these ridiculous people.

1,"Sorry Michelle.  Not all Americans can send their kids to private school where their $30,000 tuition also pays for a decent lunch.  The rest of America has to get by with public schools and crappy lunches that don't satisfy a waif let alone a growing child.  No wonder lots of districts were ditching the program well before Trump was elected.

0,"This comment was rated below the civility threshold, but it contains no incivility, obviously the truth was unacceptable to someone:  """"That's interesting. Fusion paid a retired UK spy to put together a dossier on Trump's Russia contacts. The dossier says the DNC servers were hacked by a Russian tech executive named Gubarev, who denies it and is suing Fusion and the spy. The dossier says Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, met with Putin confidant Igor Sechin to discuss Rosneft the Rusian state oil company and a quid-pro-quo deal. The FBI is taking a close look at Page.""""     http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/13/details-emerge-about-trump-dossier-firms-media-outreach-campaign/

0,"You seem over the top in dancing on what you assume - probably wrongly - is The Rebel's grave.  In reality, the extreme right and the extreme left - however you label them - are very much alike.   Both see the world entirely in black and white and both try mightily to repress, suppress, ban and boycott views expressed on the other side of the political divide.   Both use lies, intimidation and violence.   Both are vile.  Recently, the extreme left has been ascendant after 8 years of Obama and the Democrats' use of identity politics.  Arguably Obama's silence about the noxious group of race agitators,  liars and anarchists Black Lives Matter is as egregious as Trump's initial silence about the far right protesters and rioters in Charleston and instead condemnation of all violent, lawless extremist groups right and left.  Those believing in free speech - not hate speech - want The Rebel to continue.  Levant, a Jew, is not a Nazi.  Neither is Lilley who will be a loss.  Stop spinning.

0,"“Unfair” joins “sad” and “beautiful” as one-word spells to conjure the spectre of the Orange Potentate . . Nothing unfair about a below the belt personal attack in Canada's national newspaper. When Trump said Mexican """"rapists and criminals"""" he was referring to those among the illegals sneaking across the border but that was changed by the media to mean all Mexicans and has been a central theme of Trump's opposition.  When Trump said he was suspending travel from 7 countries that barely have a functioning central government that's been changed by the media to mean 'banning Muslims' and Islamophobia.  When he said he was going to extend and improve a wall on the Mexican border that is already there the media called him a racist.  When he said he was going to deport illegals with felonies the media called him Hitler.  Why not show MS13 being thrown out of the country instead of children just once.  I had lot's more. No more chars.

0,"For those who don't click on links, a few notes on Steve Bannon's tenure at Breitbart:  <<This editorial vision [at Breitbart] plays fast and loose with the facts and has a particular focus on white grievance politics. Under Bannon, Breitbart has published dozens of stories accusing U.S. Muslims of sympathizing with terrorism, questioning the citizenship of the nation’s first black President and blaming black Americans for violent crime. The site has mocked LGBTQ people, feminists and women, denied the existence of climate change, insisted that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin was an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood, and served as a propaganda arm for the Trump campaign. Bannon has also promoted anti-Semitic conspiracies about a globalist cabal of bankers, media figures and other elites working together to oppress U.S. citizens.>>  Bannon became CEO of Trump's campaign on August 17, and it made headlines. There's no excuse for Trump voters. He who lies down with dogs gets up with fleas.

0,"Perhaps Cdl. Dolan can arrange for a floor or two at Trump Tower. This way he will be rewarding someone he and the USCCB helped achieve the Presidency and in gratitude 'The Donald' can give Dolan a break on the rent. The mutual admiration these two have for each other is not lost on the people of the archdiocese so it shouldn't add to any misgivings which already exists. ;-)
"
0,"AT, It is not """"within his executive powers"""" for Trump to order Comey to back off of Flynn.  Had he done so, I would call for his impeachment in a heart beat. He didn't do that, but he came darn close.  Comey didn't think he had crossed the """"order"""" line by asking what he did.  That is why he didn't mention it to Congress.  But now that he has been fired, he is having second thoughts. Now the NYTimes - never my favorite source of info - is reporting that Trump also asked the DNI and the other intelligence leaders to say there was no investigation.  The ice is beginning to break.

0,"Compared to Clinton, Trump is not corporate owned, and the donations speak for themselves. I don't deny Trump's thought-cloud tweet reactions are embarrassing from the President of the US but the Globe's shameless one-sided reporting is part of a media establishment bias that helped empower Trump to the White House in the first place. The Globe is willfully ignorant to Trump's underlying support and continue to lose credibility accordingly. Look at Trump's Sweden comments, he was way off the mark but it's not a secret that Sweden has no-go zones where police can't go without being attacked (there were riots last Monday), ignoring that fact only empowers his base.

"
0,"NO protest, no signs and no voices are enough to drown out just how bad Trump is. Some protesters used the word """"toxic"""" and that may be the most viable choice. He has done nothing right since coming to office and daily puts on a display like a 12 year old school boy who has become a hall monitor and is abusing the privilege. He has been a business failure, having pissed a way 112 billion dollars and now has 11 billion in property. Many of those sit empty. 13 Bankruptcies and is currently being sued in 5 different States for business frauds, including his """"fake"""" University. His hair is dyed , his make up is a phony enhancement, there is nothing about him that isn't false. Impeach him and do the entire world a favour.

There is nothing new in this age old argument. However, it is magnified when Trumpet is the object of our difference. His raging egomania and insulting statements directed at his subjects were entertaining when he was the tyrant mogul on Celebrity Apprentice . It isn't funny anymore. The world of international relationships and global economics is much more complex than running a Hotel chain. To trust this responsibility to an amateur is disastrous. The truth will soon be revealed.
"
0,"I believe the odds of Trump lasting four years as president are quite low. It's been less than a week now and Trump is unsurprisingly obsessed with...wait for it...Trump's prestige. A purely ego-driven sideshow over inauguration attendance that included Trump, standing at CIA headquarters in front of their hallowed ground tribute to lost members, bragging against all available evidence that he drew the largest ever crowd and berating the media.  Eventually, everyone will see that Trump cares about only one thing - and that thing is his prestige. He will run afoul of everyone, including Republican lawmakers and members of his own team, because he is compelled to exert his power over everyone at all times. He will become isolated and uncontrollable, his party will turn against him and he will be impeached or he will quit.
"
0,"The Democrats lost the Presidency and also lost control of every other level of government. They're ruined. The GOP is stronger now than at any other point in modern US history.  The popular vote means nothing. Trump is right, all it takes to win the popular vote is to campaign in New York and California and never leave those two states. However, you would end up neglecting the vast majority of the country, and posters like you seem to think that's okay.
"
0,"Cantoperate, I am laughing with you!  As STO so nicely reminded us when quoting the Constitution which grants our President executive power of clemency """"to commute or pardon sentences as he sees fit""""....I guess that means President Trump can do his first pardon legally.  Thanks STO!  President Trump's """"approval rating"""" isn't a bench mark for getting a very difficult job done.  Nor does this poll or that poll mean much either as was apparent in the 2016 election results.  I can hear the panting and rubbing of the hands of STO, and others regarding AP's article. Surely you have other things you could be doing than childishly put down EVERYTHING our President does.  I think I'll go clean out my kitty's litter box now...

0,"When Sally Yates was up for Senate confirmation as Deputy Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions asked her whether she would oppose the President if he proposed something illegal and was very pleased when she said yes. Obviously he and his fellow Republicans felt that it was great to have a deputy Attorney General who would be willing to oppose President Obama but now feel that it is almost treason for her to oppose President Trump when she felt that his actions were illegal. If Sessions indicates a willingness to support Trump's ban, the Democrats should oppose his nomination as Attorney General, challenging the several Republican Senators who oppose the ban to join them or else abandon their principles.

From the ridiculous 'beer summit, to his AG's, and all the while Allie and folks like her gave him a complete pass. They've shown their true colors over and over again.  The country elected President Trump because they were fed-up with this bs, and the Dems couldn't field a rational, viable candidate.  They still can't.

Sharing shalt be a choice, for all else is tyranny, and it shalt always be subject to receiving something in return, so that one shalt feel good about oneself. Remember this: the temptation to throw bread crusts at a starving man is frought with peril, for once you give a hungry man free food, he will become dependent upon you. Make him learn the hard way, selfishness begets virtue"""".  Is this the Jesus you speak of? Maybe there's a different one, I think? Depends on who one asks?

Muslims built America, because Obama told them so.  Muslims do not support terrorist attacks, because.  It is good for children for their mothers to kill them.

0,"Finally, a semblance of responsibility amid the usual Washington dysfunction. A health care plan needs to have universal participation and government support in order to spread the financial burden among the widest possible population of the insured, enabling lower premium costs for everyone. Untold millions of Americans would have been either struggling to pay for or left without necessary health insurance under the new presidential order. The effort by President Trump to undo his predecessor's most notable accomplishment looks more pusillanimous than prudent. New Legacies, like reputations, aren't built by tearing down prior ones.

Maybe because with her financial resources no government team of lawyers could possibly win a verdict and those who brought the case just ended their careers?  Never the less, you are either ignorant of the facts or a straight party-line hack.  I think if Trump wins there will be an end to a lot of the political BS that has totally corrupted government and congress will keep him in check.  If Hillary wins, I hope she is impeached within hours of swearing in.  Another good thing that could happen if Trump wins, a real investigation into the Obama/Clinton corruption.

0,"Amazing that Trump supporters seem to take a 5th grade approach to anything Trump does that has red flags all over it, especially anything that may question who Trump really is as a human being, business man who needs a real resume to apply for the highest office in the land and he gets a free pass, from some.  Trump supporters tend to say that any act that is negative that Trump has performed is ok because """"So & So did the same thing"""" so that means that any act by Trump that is questionable  is ok because someone else did it to.  This is really a very immature response. Take a HUGE shovel and  dig good into Trump and his business dealings, give him the same treatment that any other politician gets and stop the cry of """"unfair"""" because Trump is above all others and is some kind of God.

0,"This is that rare time when I think the cliched phrase is appropriate; that press conference speaks for itself. It all amounts to a confirmation of what most of us already know. This man is not emotionally equipped to serve as President. He lacks the focus, the ability to commit to even a passable amount of work without immediate emotional gratification. Thus his decision to hold a campaign rally in Florida on Saturday. It's literally a campaign event, put on by his 2020 reelection campaign. Trump lacks the emotional resilience or toughness to deal with what is the inevitable criticism and difficulties of being President, which are great.

0,"Trump's excuses and alibis for Fredo's meeting with the Russians keep evolving, and the timeline of his explanations of what he knew and when he knew it doesn't make sense. Trump approved Fredo's initial story, that it was a meeting about adoption. Trump also claimed that he learned about the meeting after the publication of Fredo's emails, but Trump's lawyer (the drunk who might be disbarred for his email threats to someone he didn't know) has had the emails for a couple of weeks. Trump claims that he learned of the meeting went the emails went public, but Kushner told him about the meeting a couple of weeks ago, when he revised his SF-86 application for the third time. Today, we learn that there others in the meeting, including a former (and possibly current) Russian agent. Bizarrely, Trump tries to sweep the whole matter away by saying the 39-year old Fredo is a """"good boy"""" and a """"good kid"""" — no, he's a grown (but dimwitted) man who is the same age as the President of France.

That's excellent news for all Alaskans wanting to replace Lisa Murkowski this year. Alaska and the nation do not need six more years of someone who votes to put a poison pill (defund Planned Parenthood) in a Zika research funding bill and who refuses to vote for hearings on Supreme Court justices or federal judges and who supported Trump until she maybe didn't..but doesn't know who or what she supports. Lisa is a classic case of how to lose influence in Washington DC for Alaska's interests. Margaret Stock, the Independent candidate, offers a real solid alternative for Alaskans to gain a working Senator who will be responsive to her constituents and get things done for Alaska and the nation. She disavowed Trump from the get-go, has recently endorsed Clinton. She pledges to holding hearings & votes for justices and judges.

0,"""""HEALTH SCARE SCRATCHES CHARLES MANSON FROM TRUMP’S LIST OF SUPREME COURT PICKS By Andy Borowitz   January 4, 2017 NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—Amid reports that Charles Manson is ill, the Donald Trump transition team has removed his name from its list of potential Supreme Court nominees.  For President-elect Trump, the development was a serious setback, since Manson had reportedly topped the short list of Supreme Court picks since his name was first floated last December. At that time, Trump said that Manson’s extensive experience with the judiciary made him uniquely qualified to “shake up the Supreme Court.""""  On CNN, on Wednesday, Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway wished Manson a speedy recovery but acknowledged that losing him as a potential Court pick was a significant blow.  “We’re moving on, of course, but this is very disappointing,” she said. “There’s only one Charles Manson.”

Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man, not an actual reasoned or sane human being, he's a fraud. He's imbalanced, unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure, belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office, get him out of office now.  Trump is a white supremacist, Nazi sympathizer who should be removed from office.

An immense number of individuals have already been affected by the administration's past failed attempt at an immigration travel ban along with increased deportations and more adverse Federal court rulings blocking this new one are virtually guaranteed. The Statue of Liberty holds a torch to light the way not to keep those seeking a better life at bay.

President Trump, as with 42 of his 44 predecessors, received a majority of these votes.  Individuals such as you and I cast our votes for electors.  The selection of a president is an indirect, representative, election, not a direct one, just as our form of government, a republic, is an indirect, representative, form of government.  The citizens of California get to choose their representatives directly.  Their representatives represent roughly 20% of the votes necessary to elect a president.  It is entirely possible for the 11 most populous States to select the president over the desires of the other 39 States.  How this translates to populous States being underrepresented defies rational support of the argument attempting to be made.

As Trump said, some of these racists were violent and that is unacceptable. But violence from the other side is equally unacceptable.

Did Xi and Putin, both neighbors of DPRK, huff and puff? You can understand why these leaders absolutely will not be in the same room as Trump. The last leader who did as Trump did was none other than Adolf Hitler - against the USSR.  But why is Trump, a guy who cares only about money and fame, know zilch about global politics and economics, suddenly want to 'totally destroy' a country of 25 millions he knows nothing about? 1. He has been cornered and has no military options. Very bad for the war empire. 2. What's at stake is not the U.S. itself. Is the empire most prized colonial possessions Japan and S. Korea.

Mind you, its total lack of ethics on  currency valuations, intellectual property and adherence to international treaties on the environment and human rights and health and safety, etc.  also give it a trading advantage.

That is not defending today's comments.  But  when the U.S. Media chooses to become a political activist and national """"hit-squad"""" for endless personal and degrading attacks, even defending those making threats, and publicly issuing their own threats, there is a serious problem which must start with the U.S. Media introspection.   No matter who is in the White House, the total destruction of ethics, values, and restraint by the U.S. media will be a problem for the U.S. and for the free press.

0,"And, finally, I`m no close-minded anti-vegetarian Trump-esque freak.  At one point in my younger years, I tried to be a lacto-ovo vegetarian for about 18 months.  It failed notwithstanding working really hard to incorporate a range of different types of vegetarian protein and working hard to get the right fats etc.   On the good side, I learned to prepare vegetables in a range of interesting and appetizing ways.   Increasing veggie variety is never a bad thing.  It was actually a naturopathic doctor who told me I needed to be back on meat protein pronto -- and, he was right.   I started feeling better the day after having a yummy lamb stew at a Middle Eastern restaurant, and never looked back.  There are some people whose genetic make-up allows them to function well on a vegetarian diet, but many do not.   Misguided food fortification is part of the problem, where synthetic `vitamins` are added to foods that mess up about half of the general population`s health.

He then took another cowardly method to """"leak"""" his memos to the press. He wasn't a """"strong enough"""" person (self admitted) to express his true thoughts or feelings.

1,"Yes, protest is needed, but it's how we protest.  Rev. King demonstrated to us how we can protest--with nonviolence of the heart--and change things.  Because southern racists never accepted they had lost the Civil War fairly and for good reasons the 1954-60s civil rights movement could have easily started a second civil war--and King was aware of that.  That's clear in many of his decisions of how to proceed.  Laws were changed, but not the hearts of to-the-death racists and now we are facing that unfinished business--and we are again facing a situation that could destroy our nation. If our nation is to survive we must find the way to stand up to the white supremacists who have gained a strong foothold in the White House with Trump's complicity--without starting a civil war.

0,"Hugh...I understand this is difficult, but government employees contribute 50% of their pension contributions and the government contributes 50% just like many private sector employers (in unionized trades the employer pays 100% - consider infrastructure costs).

Yes, so people like you like to scowl.  So if a Public Pension invests in this (and I am wholly against privatization btw), it would only further ensure the stability of the plans you so hate.

The idiot contributed nothing to public life or the common good. His existence depended on the skill and labor of others; he was a leech sucking the lifeblood from the social body. Related to this, idiocy (from the root idios, 'one’s own') was the state of a private or self-centered person. This contrasted with the status of the public citizen, or polites, such that to be an idiot was to be withdrawn, isolated and selfish, to not participate in the public, political life of the city-state. In Greek society, the condition of idiocy was seen as peculiar and strange (a meaning that is retained in the English word 'idiosyncratic'); thus 'idiot' was a term of reproach and disdain. ...""""

The best thing is for Trump to tweak it to fix its shortcomings and not """"repeal and replace"""".

Read the state's revenue sources book published in December. The state did bring in $89MM in production tax. But when you add royalties, property tax, and corporate income tax, the state actually brought in $2.1B in total FY '16 revenue from oil companies. ACES would have brought us less according to DoR. The budget shortfall is because low oil prices, not the underlying oil tax structure.  For FY '17 the state owes about $600MM in cashable tax credits. This is because the Governor vetoed paying tax credits for the last two years- not because they were all generated in one year. Assuming the same happens this year, the total grows to around $900MM by FY '18. On top of that, the Legislature ended many of those credits last year with HB 247. We can debate the policy of offering credits to explorers but that's an argument for a later thread.

Hold on, Mexico, it's gonna be 4 long, long, years, and then, Trump will pass away into oblivion, and the USA will keep their wall, and a huge hole in their budget. Why Trump likes bullying the weak Mexico? probably because as a child, himself was abused. Bullies are afraid of strong ones. Trump is afraid of China, the REAL ENEMY of USA. Deficit with Mexico pales in comparison with China's. Trump could be a good president, but I see that his presidency will be a terrible winding road. He started wrong, attacking its neighbor, a friend and third biggest partner, instead of attacking its real Enemy, CHINA. We will see. If the NAFTA is killed, then border security on Mexico's side will cause a flood of crack and other drugs, that will be as common as stones in the pavement of USA streets. Happy gringos! cheap, cheaper, cheapest drugs for you to be drugged the whole day to death.

Voter eligible population is 231 million.  95 million eligible voters didn't vote.  Population that did vote was 136 million.  Trump got 62 millón.  Clinton got 64 million.   .

IMO neither party feels like it sincerely cares for all Americans.    I generally think of D as inclusive and R as exclusive.   Trump found the 'left out' and pulled the votes.   He will make policy that most benefites the already wealthy.   That will be clear soon enough.   We'll see what Democrats do to support private wage earners and new objectives for collective bargaining with private ownership.

0,"Alas, """"prove"""" is a powerful word. That Trump is unfit for office is a judgment call at best. It's my opinion, based on what he says on camera and tweets. Seems to me like he has a low IQ, poor education, low attention span, disregard for truth, a lot of bigotry, a lack of basic ethics, huge conflict of interest, and a hatred for principles of the U.S.A including respect for a free press and equal treatment for all. But I can't 'prove' any of it. That's up to the judgment of the Republicans who would have to impeach and/or declare him unfit according to 25th amendment. Still, dissent is patriotic, and my opinion is as valid as anybody else's.

Flynn did nothing wrong in having discussions with foreign officials prior to Trump assuming office. Nor, according to the FBI, did he negotiate anything concerning sanctions or anything else.

There's a lot of commenters here with something on their faces, and it's not egg.

Google journalist job cuts in the west-please don't blame the media for the lack of real news -when there is hardly a paid reporter left.

0,"Herbert Gray - It's more like the people of the US have abandoned Him and are reaping the consequences for rejecting His guidance.  I personally took Jesus with me into the voting booth and did not cast a ballot of Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. There were many better candidates who couldn't be heard over the louder voices of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. They didn't win because taking spiritual guidance with you into the voting booth is not practiced much in the United States, even among many so-called Christians. Submitting your vote to the Holy Spirit is a personal choice and not something God forces upon us. If you read the story of King Saul, you know that God will allow foolish humans to make foolish political choices if that's what they really want to do.  So foolish humans have set up a foolish election between immoral candidates who want to be tyrants and that's not God's fault.  It's ours!

What would they have to say to each other?  If the pope thinks he can influence Mr. Trump, he's mistaken.  Trump is looking for a photo op that implies that Pope Francis will kow-tow to an American president's bigoted and authoritarian agenda.  He seeks reapproachment with the pope, not!  The pope should make himself unavailable.  Such a meeting will sow further discord in the American church.  Is this the outcome aspired to by the Vatican?

Even after winning and becoming President of the US, he could not stop his lying manipulations, trying to make a profit at taxpayers expense, including making deals with the Russians & Saudis in exchange for better real estate or other deals for himself & his family.  The reason Trump will most likely get impeached is because the United State of America does not accept being led by a dictator.  Over 240 years ago the founders of this country never met Trump but knew many guys like him & wrote the Constitution to protect this country against dictators.  It is true that Mueller & Comey come from the same cloth where the FBI has helped prevent emailgate Hillary from becoming President of the US & now that Trump could not rise above being a lying, business shyster to the level of the President of the US, the FBI will now help to remove Trump who is acting like a desparate dictator.

And, despite Trump's claim that there were 15,000 attendees, the hall is only licensed for 4.200 (clearly his handlers were not expecting a large turnout) and, not only were there never that many people in the hall, many of those that did come left before he finished.  Point 2 - and he's issued his transgender ban in the military and his AG has filed a suit in an attempt to remove all LGBT protections from the law - there's only twenty years of case law on the subject (some of which extends as far as the Supreme Court) but that's not deterring Sessions.  Point 3 - if you can actually read that without laughing, especially after his remarks about Charlottesville (let alone the entire content of his campaign and the attempted travel ban) you've got to be as crazy as he is.

Now the US is demanding the same thing, and nobody has the courage to flip their middle finger at Trump and tell his to stuff this deal. For my money we'd be better off waiting four years or less till he's gone and negotiating it then. Even having no deal then would be better than what's on the table right now.  Anyway, TransCanada will do as it pleases, but it will sure be annoying if the US bargains more in their tariffs than what Albertans are getting in royalties for our resources.

0,"The system is not broken. Aside from the representation that the electoral college gives all parts of the country, a direct popular vote would not have necessarily resulted in the same vote totals. Politicians campaign in states according to the electoral map such as battleground states. In Trump's case it did no good to campaign in the large metropolitan coastal areas because they were not going to  him even if the population was only 51% for Hillary. Furthermore you can expect that many republicans stay home in these states because they know which way their particular state will go. I believe this is still a majority conservative country by a long shot. If California/ New York/ Chicago etc is 51% liberal and the rest of the nation is 61% conservative, the conservatives are the majority.

0,"Sounds like a kinder and gentler more of the same.  No word at all [the presidential campaign as well] about how the human adventure is completely dependent on the natural world.  The first priority should be, what kind of an economy and culture can fit within the boundaries of the natural world. That's hard to define but its certainly very different from what we have now.  A dishonest, vanity based economy that externalizes its costs as normal business is not what we need.  An economy where millions of jobs exist to repair the damage caused by millions of other jobs is not what we need.  A repair economy is in order. Repair the built infrastructure [and quit building more that will require repair], address social/economic disequity, restore the environment.  Investing as individuals, communities and a nation in repair means we avoid creating an even bigger mess. A green economy based on fitting within the natural world looks far better than Trump or Clinton.

That was the extent to which Trump gave himself any mention.  He referred to “we” the American people 45 times over the course of the address, including a string of mentions at the end of his speech, playing off his “Make America Great Again” slogan: “Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

So the Brits will go their way.  The irony is that after having accomplished a degree of franco-german cooperation to thwart a repetition of the two big 20th century wars through the coal/steel union, one of the objectives of new European cooperation was to be able to deal with the USA as an equal. By showing the Brits the door, they sent them towards   another door being opened for them by Trump. Junckers and Co.:  Masters in shooting themselves in the foot.

China has been revaluing its currency, the Chinese Yuan (CNY), “manipulating” it HIGHER, not lower, for almost a decade and this past year actually had to spend $800bb just to keep it from collapsing.  The Chinese Yuan has an up-down trading limit of ½ of 1 percent daily, unlike the U.S., where there are NO DAILY LIMITS. In other words, the limits are imposed by the Chinese exchange in order to protect against extreme volatility or MANIPULATION by inside or outside forces.  Huge trade imbalances continue because Chinese surplus funds are recycled into US assets in the form of funding US deficit spending at the US federal and consumer level. The surplus exists to a large degree because of the lack of US fiscal discipline which is force feeding the Chinese US debt, and if the Chinese stop supporting it, everyone goes down.  tRump literally could not be more dishonest and routinely says things that his followers eat up, without batting an eye.

Obama's policy on Russia was old school, Cold War politics. Trump on the other hand is being pragmatic. (Seriously, do Americans care that Crimea left Ukraine and became part of Russia?) At the same time, Trump is inviting Russia back from its shift to closer ties with China, while offering the possibility of cooperation on their mutual problem with Islamic State. Again, other than those with a Cold War mentality, what's for the American people to dislike?

Yet given all that (presumably whatever happened actually doesn't matter) we still have the """"War on Women"""". (And I could cite other examples of men being fired over making offensive comments, etc. But I'll leave it at that.)

Not a religion but an ideology.....I think Europe's experiences have proved Mr. Trump's actions are the correct course and the wonderful thing is, that another President, at a later time, can choose NOT to enforce existing laws concerning our borders.

Also to win the CPC leadership race you need over 16,901 points and if no candidate gets this on the first ballot, the lowest is dropped off and their second choices re-allocated.  Points are awarded best on what percentage one gets in each riding with 100 points per riding so you get 30% in a riding you get 30 points.  Leitch's problem is she may come in first on the first ballot, but likely won't pick up a lot of second choices as others fall off.

The poem points out that since the farmer has nothing to keep in or let out and nature is always trying to destroy them. why build them. One wonders how much thought Trump has given his wall or how much research he has done on the effectiveness of walls. There have been some famous ones, of course; Hadrian's, the Berlin, China's Great Wall, Israel's to keep out Palestinians, Offa's dike, the Siegfried Line, and that one that was supposed to keep the Nazis out of France.

It's pretty obvious that the time of day and content of his tweeting is not of someone who is carrying full cognitive abilities.   The general appearance has changed from the fake orange tan to a puffy and florid complection.   Leaks of Trump wandering the halls of the WH at night in his bathrobe are unsettling at best.  Shame on Republicans and supporters for this abuse.  Power and ideology before country..
"
0,"5. Finally, an article you may find interesting. There are many people out there who believe Trump speaks for the majority, regardless of what the polls state, given the recent fails of the polling industry. And if that is the case, get ready not for the failure of the Trump presidency, but for many more years of this guy. Because the people out of touch with the mainstream are the mainstream, not the Trump bunch. There's a reason they won. The shocking fact is that the mainstream is now so brainwashed, so convinced of its own moral and political rectitude, that it's incapable any longer of doing its jobs properly. And that, Ms Southey, is making things very much worse for you. So, by all means, keep it up. Keep convincing yourselves and each other that you're morally, intellectually, societally superior to all those vulgar beings who disagree with you. All that proves is the reverse. It proves you cannot stand a challenge, you cannot adapt, you cannot fight, and you cannot win.

0,"Compare and contrast this with Donald Trump's willingness to allow Ted Cruz to speak in a prime slot at the Republican convention, even though Trump had previewed Cruz's speech beforehand and knew it would be critical of him. Cruz proceeded to give that speech which was perceived as a slap in the face to Trump by not endorsing him, instead advising """"Vote your conscience.""""  So who do we want as president of our great democratic republic: Hillary Clinton, who censors and behaves towards her own party members like a dictator; or Donald Trump, who allows even his bitter rivals to speak openly and is so confident free speech is better than censorship that he risks the consequences? What can each be expected to behave like once they have the power and executive privilege of the presidency? Who will maintain the values of our founders and speak bluntly, and who will look for loopholes and tell lies in order to achieve their objectives. We are seeing the means and methods of both. Vote Trump.

0,"Trump can try to undo Obama climate rules, but he will find that environmentalists have standing and all changes are subject to legal challenge.  The Joint Chiefs will only countenance so saber rattling, so don't expect war with North Korea, even if they have to go beyond the White House's back to the Chinese.  Trump will claim credit for Obama's economy, just as Obama got the blame for the week economy of Bush until 2012 (Obama kept the Bush tax cuts on the rich, which kept labor in check because they had the incentive to keep costs down.  Since Trump can't pass anything, the Obama tax increases on the rich will keep helping labor (higher rates would, of course, be better for workers).  Trump did get Gorsuch nominated and approved.  The great unsolved question is whether he will vote like Scalia or Kennedy, Roberts and Alito.  If the former, the pro-life movement still has a voice on the court for repealing Roe.  If the latter, the movement to repeal Roe is dead.

Trump, Brexit, Le Pen - they are not facsist, they are not the 'same thing' - but they have in common some anti institutional sentiment.  Instead of reforming, the institutions are hardening their position.  The EU will push for more federalization even as the continent is against it.  Only about 20% of EU citizens want 'more EU'. About 50% of them want it 'the same' - and about 30% want 'less EU'. Broadly.  And yet they push for more? And expect the problem to go away?  It's similar to the immigration issue in Canada: almost nobody wants more immigration. Almost identical numbers, i.e. just under 50% want 'the same', about 25% want 'more' and 30% want 'less' - and yet the government wants to increase numbers radically.  It demonstrates how dumb the plebes are and how easily we are mollified by misrepresentations in the press.

He did, however, interject too many """"America first"""" items into his speech making him come off as the ugly American.  Most world leaders could care less about his bragging.  He also must have put off several European countries who have hybrid capitalistic and socialistic societies and seemingly do things much better than we do (i.e. Norway, Sweden, France, etc.).

As it stands, we have two leaders who are vastly unqualified to lead our two countries, yet it's incredible how attitude can make or break success in government.  Trudeau's fake sunny pie in the sky act hides his inexperience and resulting bad judgement calls, allowing him to still be seen as someone who can act the part of statesman and leader and always be, """"The nice good-looking guy"""" who's measured in his response.    Both claim to be one of us, which couldn't be farther from the truth.  At the very least, Trudeau's attitude is appropriate for governing, where cooperation and collaboration are key to getting things done.  Trump's attitude, on the other hand, seems like a relic of the 80s and in contrast to Trudeau, shows his inexperience acutely.  I hope both leaders rely heavily on their staffs to get our countries through this trade mess, and other messes yet to come.  It's only been 100 days.....

His campaign points were all valid but what he fails so far to understand is that governing is NOT campaigning.  Cute tweets during a campaign become Russian Roulette when elected and when you're in the Swamp, the gators who hate you have big teeth.  Having made a lot of money is one thing.

Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks–Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for $0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen–including Donald Trump–deposited the checks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for $0.13.

Agreed that politicians of every stripe and level are somewhat selective with facts and have higher levels of hypocrisy than any profession with the possible exception of lawyers.  But the Tea Partiers, Trump, and their ilk have taken things to a whole new level.  Sure, Reagan lied about Iran-Contra, and Bill lied about Monica.  But the one did it for what he perceived to be a national security issue and the other to protect his presidency and marriage.  Ethical, no, understandable, yes.  In this case Trump did it merely to feed his own ego……and unlike Reagan and Clinton, his press secretary knew it was a lie.  If the POTUS has that fragile an ego and that much disrespect for the truth, and his press secretary is in cahoots, I’d say we got a problem.

Presidents need - indeed deserve - leisure time; it's probably the most stressful job in the world. (c) your comparison fails because it's not Trump's gold game at issue but the tweets - and the repeated tweets attacking the London mayor - probably solely because he is a Muslim. Those tweets take everything Khan says out on context, and they attempt to make political capital out of someone else's tragedy. (d) You can't really know what Trump would do - and you still have not provided evidence that supports your conclusion. The whole Obama-golf thing is an obsessive diversion.

Dealing with this unpredictable, unreliable, untruthful prima donna to the south will be the major test of Trudeau's leadership. If Trump is targeting Canada, it's because - having been blocked everywhere else he turns - he sees us as a pushover. Softwood lumber was meant to soften us up.  So far, Trudeau has chosen to hold fire - no doubt on the advice of his senior advisers. And while that makes sense until we know the full extent ofTrump's demands, there will soon come a point when Canada will need to call his bluff. That will mean putting everything on the line and forcing congress to choose sides. It's the only way to deal with a bully.

Sanctions haven't worked and the UN is impotent. We, through Trump, are finally stepping up and being the reaction to NK's actions due to the UN's inaction.

Some of the writers seem to be confusing the WikiLeaks e-mails with those related to State Department business (or at least Ms. Clinton's time at the State Department), which should have been on US government servers. It was, in fact, a very serious lapse in judgement (at a minimum) that Ms. Clinton chose to maintain government correspondence, which may have contained classified information, on her personal server.  Like MSW, I will hold my nose and vote for MS. Clinton. Her opponents regularly advance conspiracy theories about the Clintons that are without foundation. However, there is strong factual basis for the matters MSW raises and, with the Clintons, there has been one scandal after another. Were it not for the importance I attach to Supreme Court nominations and the catastrophe I think a Trump presidency would be, I would be hard-pressed to vote for Hillary Clinton.

Although president's have always spoken directly to the public, their messaging (terrible term) was crafted internally, following a process of advice and reviews. When Trump tweets at 3 am, there are no filters. Many people have become so disillusioned with managing communication that they can spot it more often than public relations experts would like to accept. But in reaction, the very fact that Trump's speech is unfiltered, gives it a sense of credibility among his followers.

In 1992 Bill Clinton won with only 43% of the popular vote over George HW Bush's 37.4% and Ross Perot's 18.9%.  (Ross Perot's major campaign position was being anti-NAFTA!)  Perot lead the national polls in June, but withdrew and then re-entered, and never recovered.  The system we have forces voters to gamble with their votes - do I vote for who I really want and risk throwing away my vote and empowering someone I really don't want to win?   Instant run-off encourages focusing on candidates actual positions instead of focusing on the horse-race.

I'd like to see it work, but there are so many moving parts, literally, in global trade and manufacturing. To get Americans to buy US cars, Trump will have to impose import duties on foreign cars. Then the price of all cars will increase. And then all the foreign countries importing US goods will slap retaliatory sanctions and tariffs on their imports, and other tariffs and constraints on the components and raw materials that US manufacturers need.  Or maybe Trump thinks that you can get free raw materials while you impose tariffs on finished goods. Or maybe Trump thinks that car-making robots will buy the now more expensive domestic cars. Who knows what he thinks, or if he even does?

It is that of an Russiophobic ideologue due to her personal Ukraine ancestry. She talks like a Trump.  The whole world know the CIA sent money and agents to help overthrow the Kiev government some 3 years ago. As such it violated Ukraine constitution and was the basis of Crimea rejection of the new government. The new government also passed laws restricting rights of Ukraine's Russians. Crimea parliament (it was an autonomous region) sought exit from Kiev and was 97% approved in a public referendum. It is legal. Crimea then sought integration with Russia, which was also approved.

Democratic turn-out decreased far more: it was up among the rich, but this was far outweighed by a a big drop among lower-income groups.  In short, Trump did not win the election. Clinton lost. She did it by pursuing the centre. She did peel off some Republicans, but that wasn't enough, because the election was not decided by Trump voters or Clinton voters. It was decided by non-voters who were sick and tired of the same-old. They rejected the establishment. Running to the centre will not tempt them back.  The Democrats have also been far too focused on the presidency. They need to do the hard state-by-state work of winning governorships and legislatures, and fixing twisted election laws (gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc.)  Why are so many people intent on repeating the strategy that failed in 2016?

Hillary was the victim of a deliberate and dishonest smear campaign. Do I think that's happening with Trump? I frankly don't think Democrats have it together to mount a 30 year smear on anyone. I still think Trump is a loose cannon who could do anything, and has. But I think it might work out for the best if he stayed in office until 2021, because impeachment doesn't work out well, and then we'd get Mike Pence. Since Trump can cover all positions in the space of an hour, he may be amenable to reason. He isn't a good Modern Republican, remember. As far as """"pure and innocent"""", name me a single politician. Hillary would have been a dependable administrator, someone who wouldn't blow up the world.

0,"Hertz is way too kind to Rachel Maddow. She’s not a whip-smart commentator; she’s an intellectual lightweight. Unfortunately her voting fraud denier schtick seems to have rotted the minds of too many people, including one of my own nephews. There may well have been millions of people who voted illegally against Trump in the 2016 presidential election. A peer-reviewed 2014 paper, “Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?” put an upper bound of 2.8 million on the number of non-citizens who might have voted illegally in the 2008 election, with 1.2 million as the best estimate. There is every reason to believe that with Chicago ward boss Obama in charge the number of illegal voters was much higher in 2016. However, to get back to the tax returns, the raw numbers are hardly shocking. Maddow was undoubtedly hoping they would show Trump paid only a derisory sum in taxes and must have been terribly disappointed in what she found, even if she won’t admit it.

One thing that appears increasingly certain, however: the Republican Party's continuing shift to the right has sown seeds that will ultimately produce bitter fruit.  It's time for Republican conservatives and moderates to focus on fielding candidates that offer at least some appeal to all voters, Republican or not. Otherwise, the GOP cannot be competitive nor serve as a balance to the Democrats.

0,"Trump is being investigated. Hillary was being investigated. Everyone knows Trump is being investigated. Everyone knew Hillary was being investigated. Investigator's don't hold an investigation just because they want to sit in a room for hours staring at each other. Trump knows he's under investigation, and his attorney knows he's under investigation. Everyone on the Trump team is being investigated, including Flynn, Sessions, Kushner, Comey. It's one big happy investigation, and everyone knows it. Just like the big happy investigation of Hillary which turned up nothing worthy of further investigation. It's one thing to be careless, without malicious intent, and another to intentionally carry out purposeful, treasonous acts of collusion, corruption, obstruction, and disregard of our Constitution.

To realize that enough people in this country can ignore that, along with every other reason to keep him out of office, is unbelievable.""""  Do you not understand that statement? The key word is NOW. After all the years of bashing the Clintons over the sex allegations and Monica Lewinsky, the conservatives (and you, too) have forfeited any right to still act appalled about Bill and Hillary, and you should no longer continue to pretend to care about the women. If you don't care about tRumps alleged victims, how can you justify your ancient feelings about the Clinton accusers? How did tRump treat his accusers in his press conference? In his defense, he implied they were too ugly for him to manhandle. So, unless you help by supporting tRump's """"victims,""""  you're the hypocrite.

Huckabee Sanders put her children in the spotlight.  They are there.  She shouldn't have done it.  It was a horrible misjudgment on her part.  Now, because of her position, and what she would presumably do IF SHE STAYS with Trump, and IF SHE DARES TO APPEAR AND SPEAK FOR TRUMP, what kind of example and message will that send at her dinner table?  Harsh, but frankly true.   True for ALL members of Trump's administration.  I understand, sadly and with disgust, Chao's """"standing by"""" Trump (ONE of her men).  But, Huckabee Sanders is in a critical position to send a message to the people of this nation, and Mothers in particular.  She put herself there.  By her own words.

Factual facts get in the way of Trump's need to tapp (using his spelling) into the irrational fears and prejudices of his supporters.  I sincerely hope that I'm proven wrong, but Trump's approach to making America safer by an indiscriminate ban on Muslims from a handful of countries that have produced relatively few terrorists will risk the radicalization of many otherwise reasonable people who now feel threatened and marginalized. I listened to an excellent interview with an Iraqi-American doctor, now living in rural Georgia and a former interpreter for US troops in Iraq. Since Trump's election he and his family have been taunted by his patients and their neighbours to the point that they are picking up and moving to California. It is doubly tragic since doctors are hard to come by in rural Georgia; and his teenage kids, born in America, are now ideal breeding ground for terrorist indoctrination. So sad.

0,"It isn't skin colour, it is culture. Having one's culture replaced by another. Every culture has fought against that, that is what fights against assimilation by minorities are about, why is it morally wrong when it is the majority feeling threatened?  Especially when it is forcefully encouraged by one's elites through mass illegal immigration, and with preferential hiring of non-whites, massive social programs directed towards those illegal immigrants, etc.  More gradual, controlled immigration that allowed for successful assimilation, as happened in the past, and programs that encouraged colour-blind hiring rather than preferential hiring by race, would do wonders to calm down the situation. There is little resentment of Asian immigrants for those reasons, they integrate well.  Why has there been little discussion that Trump's proposal is for a more Canadian-like model? Too embarrassing?

Prior to that Britain & France should have kept the fascists out of the Saar, the Ruhr, and Austria.  Britannia ruled the waves then and she had a great empire;  French tanks and planes were superior to the German's.  What the Allies lacked was will.  SK, Japan, Australia, and the US face an existential threat from Kim which is much greater than any country faced from the European fascists in 1938. The Allies today have a formidable military alliance which should be used to prevent Kim from destroying them.  Once Kim has the capability to hit the Allies with thermonuclear ICBMs he could cause much more horrific damage than if the Allies disarm him now.  Hitler invaded Poland on 1.9.39 after appeasement failed.  Trump must stop the fascist NKs & Iranians to prevent a terrible Allied catastrophe.

If they do not respond, they are moved out.  Politics is completely different. Politics requires the politician to create alliances, to find solutions to complex problems.  You do not achieve political goals by issuing executive orders, or alienating competing players. Trump's failure to recognize these differences will likely prove to be his undoing.

The fracas between President Trump about Sessions was designed to the two men to change the health care narrative giving the Republicans more time. CNN and fake news took the bait.

They were thinking more on private citizens able to cache weapons prospectively, if ever, needed to militarily protect against their own govt's wrongs against the citizenry.   Not long before, their own govt's taxes enslaving the citizenry might not have been won against their King, but for their private arsenal of weapons ensuring their individual human freedoms.

0,"As the truth about this meeting dribbles out, Trump's troubles are growing. While flying back from the G20 meeting, Trump approved the Russian adoption cover story, although he had to have previously been briefed about Fredo's emails, if not by Fredo then by his attorney, who had the emails for a couple of weeks. Trump had also been told about the meeting weeks ago by Kushner, after he amended his SF-86 for the third time. It is increasingly apparent that Trump has engaged in a coverup — he knew that the meeting wasn't about adoptions. His lawyer (the drunk who faces disciplinary action for his threatening emails to a stranger) was reportedly not involved in preparing the statement, so Trump can't claim attorney-client privilege. If anyone on the White House staff who was aboard Air Force One and who participated with Trump in crafting the bogus cover story doesn't have a personal lawyer, now is this time to hire one.

0,"Joe,  It's not as though Canada can protect its legitimate trade interests by lying low and hoping nothing too bad happens.  In fact, the modus operandi of the Trump administration appears to be to begin any negotiation by making exaggerated demands in a very aggressive manner and thereby begin to learn how much their opposite number is prepared to give way.  Having intimidated Canada once and thereby exacted more than they expected to gain, will not the US deal with us from such a dominance/subordination perspective thereafter?  Of course, Canada would only lose through gratuitous hectoring of the Trump Administration or overly aggressive (in tone or substance) responses in rebuttal to positions advanced by the US in the upcoming negotiations.  Isn't a reasonable but firmly presented presentation by Canada that focusses upon the mutual benefits but cautions concerning what the US, as well as Canada, stands to lose if the negotiations go south the approach to take?

China does not want a real confrontation due to the N. Korea refugee problem, plus the potential U.S. presence on a unified Korean peninsula. Putin does not want the losses that he would sustain in a Baltic operation. However, N. Korea provides a thorn in America's side that they can control.

By comparison, obama working with congress, accomplished major bailouts of the economy and bailouts of the auto industry as well as Obamacare in his first year in office.  Trump is set to accomplish nothing. The way government works is that a president is supposed to be able to work with his own party to pass bills.  He can't.

They know he has all but destroyed the Republican party as has it has been historically known.  But they also know the implicit deal is that, if he's elected, he'll sign whatever they can put in front of him (and veto whatever they tell him to veto, should enough Democrats and disgusted Republican defectors manage to pass something of their own).  That would give them a chance to lock in their """"Republican legislative agenda.""""  That would give Paul Ryan the """"legacy"""" he so badly craves.

If Michael Flynn gives testimony with specific immunity and someone wants to punish him, they would simply prosecute him for 'trumped up' charges based on something other than that testimony.  No immunity can protect a person from false charges if someone is determined to do that.  A grant of immunity is, however, effective is in protecting you from conviction for the crimes you're going to give evidence on.  So no, there really is no reason to seek immunity if you don't think the evidence you're about to give has a good chance of leading to your conviction.  The reasons to grant immunity are clear - his evidence will lead to the conviction of someone even more important.

This is a conversation we must have and a cause that we all need to take up so that this country can live up to the ideals set forth in the constitution.

This time around euro-oligarchs created an empire to impose neoliberal reforms and globalism on a continent of largely social democrats who would never vote for the policies. See """"Robert Mundell, evil genius of the euro.""""  What this means is that when people find out what happened many will blame the Jews. Of course, the Jews are not European aristocracy. They've been the whipping boy of Europe since Constantine.  My guess is that robber baron sociopaths would rather Jews get blamed for destroying the Western economy than themselves.

0,"I believe the Russian force is massed in Russia at the Latvian Border. Latvia is one of the Baltic states that Putin supposedly covets. Poland itself has no common border with Russia proper or with Latvia. However, Poland shares a border with the still-rebellious (against Moscow) western Ukraine, and Putin likely regards Poland as a corridor for NATO invasion. To get to Poland, Russia would have to go through Latvia and Lithuania, or through Belarus, which has friendly relations with Russia but is nominally neutral; or even through western Ukraine, though that's a lot of armed hostile territory. So at this point, Russia and NATO are not facing off at opposite sides of a common border unless it's Kaliningrad, an isolated Russian outpost vulnerable by land, sea and air. Russia probably would like a corridor to Kaliningrad along with eastern Poland, which it has invaded numerous times before. In a few days NATO and Russia are Trump's problem; we'll see how tough or """"wimpy"""" Donald is.

0,"Ms. Patkotak, thank you for this important column. I also agree that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are good, decent, hardworking people who are not themselves bigoted. The problem, however, is not individual racism but institutional racism. When the levers of power are predominantly accessible to select classes of Americans -- and denied to others -- discriminatory practices are built into the very structure of that society. What we saw in the election of Donald Trump was a panicked grab for those levers by a class of Americans who not only feels their grip slipping, but also spies those """"other"""" classes coming up fast. This is what the """"Again"""" in MAGA is all about. The vehemence with which some commenters on this thread deny that fact is proof of the primacy of institutional norms to guide individual behavior, even for otherwise good, decent, hardworking people.

Perhaps, when McConnell was told about all this before election day and refused to lend credibility to the findings, that was Obama too.

Mr. Obama was not only a weak leader, but his weakness put Russia in the catbird seat in Syria, leaving Turkey to realizing if anything was to get done it would have to go through the Kremlin versus Washington Sad that much of what Mr. Trump must deal with today is the leftovers of past administrations in Washington, who either appeased or were just plain weak as Mr. Obama was.

0,"Typical whiny thin skinned diatribe from another one of Trump's unprincipled goons, whose sole criteria for this president's job performance is how much anger he can elicit from """"liberals"""" (ignoring the plentiful disgust and anger that is becoming common in conservatives). This president's only accomplishments to date have been the total defiling of the office of president, a lowering of the state of public discourse to the level of pro wrestling, and turning our government into a nepotistic family for-profit enterprise. All of the bigoted and sociopathic promises he made and you cheered have not, and will not, come to pass. In fact nothing will get done, including attention to very serious matters, given the president spends his days obsessed with repairing his fragile, massive ego. But as long as """"liberals"""" are upset, that's all that matters, even if the whole country goes down for it.

Even the press that's hostile to the president has to along with it.  In America's polarized politics, media that's for or against the president alienates half the available viewers. But media that focuses on some claimed external threat gets everyone listening. All the president's bad news disappears, while his steadfast stand against some foreign danger looks like heroism in the public's eye.  I'm not picking on Trump here. Obama did it before him, and Bush and Clinton did it before that. What I'm pointing out is the myth of the 'free press' in the West. While the media may be financially independent from government, governments can so easily bend it to their will that effectively the media isn't free at all.

1,"Ms. Parker's point is a good one.  Generations from now, will the world wonder how we could have been taken in?  Donald Trump has told us repeatedly what his values are, and how he would apply them, control the press and punish anyone who disagrees with him.  A free press is crucial to democracy, even if occasionally biased.  He would appoint like-minded advisors, or maybe just rely on his 'very good brain', and refuse to tolerate dissent.  He likes to shout """"You're fired!"""", and would take every opportunity to do so.  Diplomacy, according to Trump, is for 'losers'.  With his taunt to Ted Cruz that 'my wife is prettier than your wife' he has descended to 3rd grade level.   And yet you defend him. Incredible.

Either way the taxpayers and energy ratepayers are going to pay for it for decades to come. Challenge now is, how does a successor apportion the costs. Taxpayers are already at the limit. Corporations are already at a competitive disadvantage in Ontario when compared to New York or Ohio with a leader in Washington that is not friendly to Canada (or anyone else outside of Goldman Sachs) We didn't have this problem in the energy portfolio before the Liberals. In fact our energy costs were a reason to move to Ontario, not run from it. Very """"Art of War"""" of them, turned our strength into a weakness.

That’s a huge, huge attack that Republicans are going to try to force through really quickly.  Neither the Republicans nor Trump have any viable replacements for these healthcare programs.  Their interest is serving the insurance industry and providing for the wealthy who have no need for basic public healthcare options.  We do have a need.

I understand that people need to keep their word, but having to uphold a decision from the past to 'make good' on a promise made in the past is not a good way to govern (my opinion).

To me, 'you promised' is not a good criteria for making decisions about the expenditure of resources.   The decision should be about what is best for Eugene. (and if rebuilding trust trumps this issue, and that is a well considered decision, that is fine)  I would love to see data on the percentage of people who mistrust the city government, I believe (note that this is an opinion, it is not quantified) that the level of mistrust is being overstated.

0,"It will probably take decades or a cataclysmic event to cultivate a significant growth of a third party - whether Liberterian or Green. We are not there yet. If we hand the country over to Trump and his followers, we'll be in a deep hole that does not nurture the growth of a third party- in addition to all the disasters a Trump election would cause that are described elsewhere. Therefore, I see the arguments for voting for a third party in this election are at best superfluous if not plain wrong.  The choice is Trump or Clinton. We can dissect and argue about the past and their previous actions for a long time but we all know that the differences between them are very significant. A Trump election will be a disaster based on multiple reasons described in yesterday's letters to the editor. We cannot keep our heads in the sand by arguments that imply that both candidates are equally """"bad"""" and that we need to vote for a Third Party or not vote at all. Such actions are a vote for Trump.

If any of you who support the Paris accord have AC, or have a dog it’s going makes it difficult for any participation to be taken seriously.  AC counts for 20% of all electricity cost.

This minority of white evangelicals still supports the other decidedly unchristian values espoused by the Republican party and have done so for decades. So there's a growing """"sense"""" that character matters among evangelicals--big deal, it only matters to an certain extent because the nature of the political system is much more determinative than a particular candidate's character.

Jon Sobrino's Jesuit brothers, the housekeeper and her daughter brutally murdered in El Salvador, along with nuns and Archbishop Romero. 70 000 innocents murdered in a ten year period. The murderers trained in Miami, the murders funded and directed by the US administration under Ronald Reagan.  Under freedom of info, activists were able to access CIA reports which advised the US government that America owned or had direct control over upwards of 70% of the world's mineral resources, wealth etc.. If that situation was to continue, various steps had to be taken. One of them was to keep the fear of communism alive in the US.  Very little has changed.  President Trump!

McMaster also said that no information regarding military operations was shared other than that which is already publicly known. The Post article made no mention of military operations. McMaster's defense of Trump denied two allegations that were never made by the Post.

She denied doing it to spy on Trump but could not explain why she needed the names in the name of national security, could she be lying again?

I think if the Republicabs are interfering with investigations into Trump's potential treason, then they should be held accountable, and be charged with obstruction of justice, and as accessories to colluding with an enemy government, to commit espionage and treason. Congress must be compelled to open up Trump's tax returns to the public, to see what Russian monies from Putins gold room, or the Russian mob, or Russian Oligarch's, he had recieved before, or after his 6-7 bankruptcies.

The response from one, was revealing. The person leaned over and whispered """"they are all 'leaners' here, they wouldn't admit they are going to vote for Trump"""".  Seems with all the sophisticated tools, that little point about lack of posters in yards, so obviously visible,  was missed.

As a country we now are forced to have the dialogue.  We are indeed a Nation of immigrants.  However, do we want to allow people here that are fully vetted and will proudly call themselves American, OR do we want to go the way of Europe by sticking our heads in the sand out of PC concerns and allow immigrants to come here that want us to bend to their customs, honor their religion (at our expense), and quite possibly want to do us harm?!?

0,"2 particularly disturbing signs as we transition to a Trump administration: 1) The President elect's national security advisor, Mike Flynn (and son) promoting the lie about a child sex ring aka pizza-gate. 2) the shameful editing of a video by a FOX show host to promote the lie that Obama said it was OK for illegals to vote.  While its happened in an isolated case here or there on the left, the fake news epidemic is primarily a problem with conservatives. Indeed creators of fake news have said they've tried to promote their fake stories on sites trafficked by liberals and finally gave up when those stories failed to gain traction. But conservatives eat up their BS news like its filet mignon. Once a BS story gets imbedded into some conservative minds, nothing, not irrefutable fact, visual documentation or undeniable truth will ever convince the conservative otherwise.  This conservative ignorance is how America transforms itself from world leader to idiocracy in the blink of an eye.

The GOP is full of folks that don't believe that all lives matter. That goes double if they are not white. Who do you think voted for Trump? Just ask them, don't take my word for it. Most of them are too ignorant to follow the money. They think minorities and the poor get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. They think they are victims of folks worse off than them. The ethanol subsidies help the fossil full industry and the corporate farms. That is corporate welfare. Now that the renewable energy and natural gas resources are more cost effective than coal or oil, Trump and his minions are happy to give those industries more corporate welfare. Never mind the people poisoned down river. Their lives don't matter to the corporations involved and the politicians they buy.

If so, then I hope the parallels that Dr. Faggioli identifies continue.......with the same conclusion.  I have believed it will anyway.  It is nice to have it sketched out even further. BTW - there is a professor here in the US who conducts polls, and who was the only one who predicted a Trump win.  He uses a different model of poll-taking then the ones used by everybody else.  I wish I had retained the article and his name (I'll look for it).  Oh - the other item he predicted at the same time was that Trump will be impeached at mid-term for, I believe, leaking national security secrets and conducting business while in office that benefits his own bank account.

We did know at the time oil was in steep decline and those who proposed it thought it would slow the decline down or maybe even increase the oil in the pipeline. Legislator's proposed it and we the people voted in support of it. Once Trump is elected he'll open up more areas to search for oil and his plan to rebuild America will require way more oil , which should make prices go back up helping our state economy. His rebuilding our military in Alaska will be a huge boost to our economy as well. As will increased mining and logging under a Trump administration. We must stop all spending on the gas line to save what money we have left. If the greenies are right and global warming is real , before long we'll have ice free ports up north so ships can pick up the gas there and there won't be a need for any gas line--saving 45 to 65 billion .

When children, US Citizens, come home from school to find there mother and father are not home but have been arrested, that is Mean Spirited. When a family has lived in the US for decades, paying taxes, committed no crimes, but when the wife comes home to find her husband has been arrested, that is Mean Spirited.  The majority of undocumented people want to stay under the radar, they don't make waves, they want exactly what you want, a home and a safe place to raise their kids.

0,"Uh....NO.  We pretty much know the facts behind how the dossier was paid for.  The ONLY thing we don't know yet (and that information will be released on Tuesday) is who the REPUBLICAN candidate was who initially commissioned this report.  Like I said above, the most likely culprit was Jeb Bush. Of all the Republican candidates, he had the most money AND the political knowhow to employ a firm to do opposition research on Trump.  Let's not lose sight over the fact that almost all political candidates use data research firms to gather information about their political foes in order to run a targeted campaign.  Trump certainly did, using Cambridge Analytica for their data research firm.  Fusion GPS has worked for several candidates of different parties often simultaneously.  It's a business.  Finally, just because the lawyer paid for the Dem part of the investigation doesn't mean that any of that information ever reached the campaign.

0,"If there was ever a time for a psychological evaluation of a sitting president, that time is NOW. Trump is clearly mentally unstable. He should not be allowed to make ANY decisions that affect our country and its citizens, until this evaluation is complete and he passes all the necessary psychological tests. Whatever is necessary to have this evaluation done, needs to be set in motion. Our country is in great danger with Trump in charge, and everyone knows it. The most likely result of a mental evaluation will show that he is not mentally stable, and is unfit to run our country, This is why the 25th Amendment is part of our Constitution.

Yes, the travel ban involving a few middle eastern countries would not directly affect enrollment to a large degree, but the travel ban has led foreign students (and tourists) to conclude they are not welcome in the US, that there is a greater risk of hassles at immigration or chance of a right-wing nut job mistaking them for a terrorist and shooting them, and they are going elsewhere.

0,"Siding with Hillary is hardly problematic. What was problematic is when she said the following about Donald Trump:  “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence invites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.”  That would be fine, but earlier in her speech, she said (earning laughs):  """"So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick them all out you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.""""  Apparently Meryl Streep, a powerful public figure on a public platform, can mock and malign a group of people with no apparent sense of irony.

"
0,"We pay interest on money borrowed that keeps our government running and economy churning.  But putting things in perspective over the last 10 years what we paid really isn't so bad thanks mostly in part to historically low interest rates.  Last year, for example, Uncle Sam forked over $223 billion to keep the chains of debt around his neck. That’s less than we paid to service this debt 10 years ago, when the national debt was only about 40% of today’s. The problem I see is that Trump wants to spend 1 trillion over 10 years on infrastructure (you know, to make america great again) which will result in inflation rising and to curb inflation you raise interest rates. By 2019 or 2020 it may costs the us government upwards of $500 billion dollars a year to finance our debt as old debt is rolled over and re-issued at higher rates. Remember, despite the populist rhetoric, everything the government does will have an impact, even if it sounds like a win/win.

While Trump is obviously and overtly detestable, when I look at Clinton's governmental history, things are very chilling.

I suspect the biggest conundrum for his potential solutions is the fact his own position is considered 'infallible'.  I get that depends on who holds the papacy, what the topic is, and who is doing the viewing. This is why we could easily revert to a sad form of Western 'Catholic' Civilization is the end all and be all of human civilization.

Even the right wing to far-right just like the left wing and far-left can be protectionist without going into National Socialism or Socialism or Communist on the far-left. People have to understand that prior to Reagan protectionism and the mixed economy was the mainstay of capitalism.  Also, Trump is not proposing using a state bank to pay for infrastructure. He is using P3s which are massively private and could lead to tolls, and is not effectively using the levers of government to have a very low cost for the infrastructure or even the avenues of taxation, and like I said he is not using an infrastructure bank to be used as a way of getting key priorities or infrastructure done.  He has shown that he is corporate-minded.

0,"I'm detecting a slight bias here.  Actually, the Pakistanis offered up bin Laden twice in the late 90s to then president Bill Clinton who demured because he was not a leader who liked to handle hot potatoes and Monica was then a hot enough potato for him to have to handle.  The Taliban never offered up bin Laden and if you have any credible sources that say otherwise please present them to us.  Pakistan gave bin Laden sanctuary for several years mere meters from its premier military academy before an intelligence leak involving bin Laden's driver led to a tip as to his whereabouts.  Trump won't put up with this kind of double dealing and crap.  Instead, he will cut off the billions of bucks a year the US gives in foreign aid to Pakistan and will ensure new prominence for India as a US ally.  Either that or Pakistan gets its act together.  We shall see.  But its nice to have a US president again who is willing to act instead of just apologize and to cut through the BS and subterfuge.

On a slightly different note, I believe Trump has not been west of the Mississippi since he won, and if so, it was either briefly (fly in, fly out), or barely (Like St Louis, just the other side of the river)...which is odd, he won a lot of western states - bigly (say, why does """"bigly"""" get spellchecked?).

It is also, ironically, likely to strengthen support for the very groups — ISIS and al Qaeda — that he claims he wants to defeat, given that nothing drives support for those groups like U.S. slaughter of civilians (perhaps the only competitor in helping these groups is another Trump specialty: driving a wedge between Muslims and the West).

Sadly so many refuse to see this blatant exploitation,

1,"Donald Trump is, in every way, unfit to be President.  He doesn't understand government, he bullies rather than negotiate, he insults anyone who dares to hold a differing opinion, he simply lacks common respect and decency for others.  He is, IMO, a sociopath and his behaviors are consistent with the characteristics of a sociopath.  In other words, it's unrealistic to expect him to act in any way different from what we seeing each day.  Indeed, that one word is appropriate........Sad.   Gary Crum

0,"I watched a good deal of Trump's meeting at the White House with first, President Obama, and then Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, and my observation was that the President-elect looked like those I have seen immediately following a substantial car accident: shell shocked, bewildered, and having trouble cognitively processing the event and input of the immediate environment.  Not being experienced in the least in public office, I believe Trump will have many, many days like this to come.  He is unprepared - as many of us knew - for this office and the huge amounts of vital information that must be retained - something that no business person is at all experienced in.  He is going to falter and fail, no matter who he gathers around him because, as we all have heard from every President, there are those hours in which they are left alone in having to make a decision that impacts the entire world.  Thinking like a businessman is not a solid base on which to stand.

Is that enough for a president of the US?
"
0,"Indeed.  Seeing the horrendous situation the US has fallen into, one would think a government leader with a conscience would adhere to his stated commitment, to bring in an electoral system which would help his children and mine to avoid falling under the sway of a populist dictator like Trump.  Top two issues for me in voting last time around were climate change and electoral reform.  I gave Trudeau the benefit of the doubt.  Won't make that mistake again, and nor will the rest of my family and acquaintances, from what I've been hearing since yesterday.  No more votes, donations, signs, verbal support, nada.  What a terribly cynical, dishonest, and unethical man Trudeau has turned out to be.  So many Canadians thought better of him than this.  Just like the last guy, his thoughts and actions have been bought by the fossil fuel lobby.

To bypass the anti-nepotism law, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are serving in the White House as volunteers and will not take a salary.  Jared Kushner is the Secretary of Everything. He is responsible for Middle East Peace, Government Reform, Opioid Crisis Management, liaison to Mexico, liaison to China, Veteran Affairs reform, criminal justice reform, and keeping Ivanka happy at nights. Not bad for a C+ student in high school who did poorly in his SATs.  Despite all his important posts, he never says anything on camera. Kushner doesn't do press interviews and won't answer questions. I guess enriching the Trump and Kushner fortunes means more than actually serving the people.

My guess is he'll get at least half of what he promised in the first term.  It will be exciting to watch him destroy so many of the bad laws Obama signed.   Starting with Obamacare .   Put another way---I wouldn't want to be an illegal in America at this time or a sanctuary city harboring illegals .

Trump will build the wall for 40 billion tops which is steep and I don't assume will work all that well without an increase in border agents. However illegals cost upwards of 200 billion a year in strain to the economy so I'd certainly choose a wall and increased agents if we're talking about the economical sense. What's that make me racist, xenophobic, islamophobic, bigoted or just plain common sense. You must have some label.

As president, lacking a healthcare plan of his own, he glommed on to Paul Ryan's militantly anti-life healthcare plan and subsequently developed his own obscene, militantly anti-life budget.  Taken together, the healthcare plan and budget would accomplish exactly what Trump intends them to accomplish: a massive tax cut for the very wealthiest among us. Meanwhile, Trump's pro-death policies will, if enacted, lead to more abortions, more infant mortality, more maternal deaths, more sickness, more death. Unfortunately, there were bishops and others in the """"pro-life"""" camp who bought into Trump's con; all the sadder for the church in the United States. Who knows what, if anything, the Republicans can get passed?? They seem nearly as incompetent as the president.

Most likely he is not nearly as rich or has the business success he claims, he he not near as generous to charities as he states, and/or he is cheating or gaming the tax system to pay no or little taxes. I know you probably do not care if you are supporting a potential lier and a cheat, but the rest of us do. If you do not care you should not care about Hillary's misstatements either (she has released more than 10 years of her tax returns).

Trump has attacked them incessantly and has yet to say a single negative thing about Putin. In fact he apologizes and praises him constantly. Do agree with that? Trump (and Putin) and many reasonable and intelligent people (apparently including you) want to turn this attack by Putin on our country into a partisan issue. It isn't.  Our nation and our allies are under attack and we are about to put a President, Cabinet and Party in power who either fully support the Putin/Trump axis or lack the integrity to speak up against them.

Bannon's ban and preoccupation with those who are different has now taken hold of The Donald who is now under the spell of of racist polemics.  Bannon is unquestionably smarter than Trump and will undoubtedly steer the ship right onto the rocks.  Trump's starving ego makes him an easy target for those who are willing to stroke him the right way, in this case the far right way.  Whatever the case, Canada has much to gain by being there to catch those who are neither respected nor respected for what they can bring to a country.

The big trick is to indicate to the guard in question, without explicitly saying it, you really couldn't care less if you enter the US or not.

If the students had wanted to really force the issue, they would have refused to leave the building, thus forcing the University to remove them . . . which would have been a PR disaster for the University.  It would also be a PR disaster for the University--which is a state agency--to expel or file charges against the students who occupied the stage.  The University would simply be confirming exactly what the UOSC was saying: that order trumps freedom of expression in the eyes of the POTU, that student speech can be suppressed by state power because it's somehow not """"real"""" speech unless it's exactly what the state says it should be.  President Schill better get out in front of this. The logical escalation for the UOSC would be to occupy the administration building.

From what Trump has said in his speeches about non-whites, it's pretty obvious he's still having a hard time """"figuring out what is proper behavior"""" and his daddy isn't calling the shots anymore so you can't blame him.

One has only to look at the numbers in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.  In Wisconsin, President Trump won by about 38/100ths of one percent of the voters, fewer than 4 out of 1000.  His margin of victory in Pennsylvania was about 36/100ths of one percent of the voters, again fewer than 4 out of 1000.  In Michigan, the margin was much smaller, about 11/100ths of one percent, or barely more than 1 voter out of 1000.  It is not hard to argue that Russia's and Comey's actions swayed that miniscule number of people to vote for candidate Trump rather than candidate Clinton, who would have won the electoral vote had these three states swung her way.  I personally know a few people whose votes were determined by Russia's and Comey's actions.  I would like to see some well-researched data regarding how many voters were swayed by Russia and Comey.

I believe the first and second amendments are equally important and Trump does too. He just does not think that the first amendment gives license to lie and neither do I.  The kind, respectful, fair and balanced manner that Obama was treated by Rush, Hannity, Breitbart and others in conservative media over the last 8 years? He wasn't given that any more than Bush was by liberal media for his 8 years. Do not know why you would say that.

It's huge. But why am I not surprised. Trump, a racist, wants to destroy every trace of the Obama presidency.) The fight against climate change has to be total. Yet at the same time economies cannot simply be sacrificed. Political recklessness can result in social chaos, which, tragically, is already happening. The US has always been a huge political hurdle. In my book Fools Rule, Inside the Failed Politics of Climate Change, I recommended that the world turn its back on the U.S. since its primeval politics will never allow Congress to commit to a global climate treaty.

What Americans saw, day in and day out, from the announcement of his candidacy, and throughout his campaign to become President, was an unprecedented pile on that went from criticism to ridicule and demonization.  Part of the American character is belief in a fair fight.  Trump deserved criticism for ongoing factual errors he made, but the outright attack on him became 24-7.

Should all (white) Americans be required to carry a firearm at all times?  Are rich people rich because they're simply better than you?  Is climate change a hoax?  If you fail to answer 'yes' to any of the questions you will be rounded up and sent to re-education camps in Texas and Oklahoma.

0,"Trump's relaxing of regulations will help the coal companies, but it will not stop the decline of coal-- a matter of technological change, markets and competition, and public choice. Cheap natural gas and oil, with discovery of large reserves, will continue to beat coal in the market. Even the CEO's of our largest coal companies have cautioned that relaxing regulations will not lead to significant increases in employment in the coal industry. Coal is  ahighly mechanized industry with coal recovered by strip mining horizontally over the landscape taking down hills and mountains and not so much vertically in to the ground this is a big factor in the decline of work for coal miners.

The author had sufficient information available to know there was more to the story and cut-off their reporting at the point that all it did was defame Carson.

It sucked all of the oxygen out of the room for any other candidate, both in the primaries and in the general.  That coverage did him no harm, at all.

I think the World Wide Web will dwarf the advent of the printing press and the Industrial Revolution in historic importance.  There is desperate irony in the idea that the Web would benefit mankind by making the world's knowledge available to all, anywhere and anytime. As we have seen, the actual effect has been to allow people to tailor their news consumption to sources that bolster their own convictions. New studies show that sophisticated young people, having come of age in this new paradigm, cannot differentiate between real and fake news. Trump lies continuously with no penalty from his fans.

0,"JSB1, I personally support a flat tax (which will likely never materialize).  But in our current state, maintaining some progressive taxation makes sense given the extreme and worsening US wealth inequality.  What little is known of the Trump tax plan shows that if you make over $4M in income, you will get a 14.2% income bump.  If you make $80K, you get a measly $1.8% bump.  That's obviously not going to help.  Extreme wealth inequality is bad for everyone, including that top 20% (a group to which I belong).  When it gets bad enough, political polarization, inequality and other metrics of national economic health worsen, citizens are more disenfranchised and the torches, pitchforks and guillotines soon follow.  As Plutarch said nearly 2000 years ago: """"An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics.""""  Trickle-down economics has never worked.  The bottom 80% is the true engine of our economy, let's support them.

0,"There seems to be a rather absurd idea that people are under obligation to tolerate intolerance. Simply not true. At the end of the day, the US elected Donald Trump and he is now engaging in behaviour that the world is under no obligation to indirectly approve or support, so their decision comes with consequence. Welcome to adulthood.

0,"@ C.C. Don't expect the Republican controlled Senate to do anything. Trump was smart enough to appoint the Majority Leader's wife to his Cabinet (Transportation Secretary).  I wouldn't want something I said or did to result in my wife getting fired and I'm guessing Mitch feels the same way about his wife.

1,"Odd that you just don't care that Putin is the person who installed your new leader. Odd that you don't care that he subverted American democracy. I have to ask, what if Putin stole those emails, used them to elect Trump, and probably has this President as his stooge...do you care? If that could be proved would you get behind impeachment? Or do you hate the left so much you are willing to suck up to a murderous dictator like Putin.  Hugh Massengill, Eugene Oregon.

Continuing the DACA program as it is doesn't offer the security some of these young people and their supporters believe it does.  They are a court ruling away (and process is in motion right now) from losing the program.  Trump would be foolish to let this ride until a court stops it abruptly, or leave it to the whims of the next president.

Not a ginormous immigration package with gotchas dooming it to failure.  But address THIS problem.

Is it that hard to believe that some unhinged, impressionable leftie won't see that as an opportunity to get approval if they do something like this?  Think back to why Hinckley shot Reagan?  The rhetoric that causes things like this has no place in society period dot.  Problem is the left only thinks the rhetoric that is dangerous is that which is directed at them.  When it goes the other way they write it off as """"theater"""", """"comedy"""", or good ole """"Patriotism"""".

If you recall the media announced the winner and the west coast stop voting for the president, so now that cannot be released until all polls have closed.  Really what is wrong with letting the popular vote stand? Electoral College does not have to vote with what the majority wants, have you thought about that?  This election should be given a rest, it will go down in history as the worse presidential race in history, both parties are to blame, the one good thing, the rest of the world got a good laugh at what they were seeing.

Yes the pause button is needed so President Trump can complete what he was democratically elected to do, the establishment media can email their questions, its all they deserve !!!

0,"As much as I dislike Trump, he's no Hitler.  Has he borrowed a few pages from his playbook, yes!  Does he use fear tactics, absolutely.  Is he relying on the under educated, of course.  He admits it.  This combination of shoddy, unethical tactics have garnered him millions of supporters.  How he won over evangelicals is easily explained.  In my opinion, it's that common thread, that familiar element of borderline hysteria that we recognize with religious zealots - fear and fantasm.  Get that adrenaline going, like a preacher at the pulpit, and his followers are hooked regardless of what nonsense he spouts.  And like so many preachers at the pulpit, Trump is purely self serving.  He never has and never will do anything to promote the common good.  He doesn't know how nor does he care to learn.   Vague, empty promises to promote his own agenda and that of his children - that's it!  It shouldn't take one of his peers, Mark Cuban, to point this out.

We don't know why Trump really fired Comey. If it was indeed """"the Russian thing"""" as he stated then what was his motive? If it was to interfere with the investigation then we have a case that Comey's firing itself was an obstruction of justice.  We may find out. Or, if he is smart, Mr Trump will keep quiet and the council won't find evidence. Trump is his own worst enemy.

Amazing thing to me is that """"conservative"""" editorialists like Jennifer Rubin, Kathleen Parker and even David Brooks have recognized the malignancy of the trump modus operandi and are speaking out forcefully in opposition to his divisive and destructive policies. The American mainstream media deserves a lot of criticism for it's role in creating an atmosphere where a cretin like trump would even come close to election as public works commissioner for Podunk, N.J. or in how they got so behind Bush as he launched his illegal invasion of Iraq. But simply pointing out that the glaring flaws of trump and his entourage most certainly don't rise to the level of being the """"enemy of the American people"""" as he spewed out yesterday.

If the U.S. is not strong, we cannot help the rest of the world. Do you agree with that? Trump wants to change the tax code. Past President's for decades haven't tackled the issue. It's about time someone ran the government like a business. Does it bother you that billions of dollars have never been accounted for from Hillary's State Dept.?  How can you simply not care?

The US is under no obligation to prove anything to anyone before acting in their own defense.  They will act, and it will be punishing for Russia and Mr. Putin.

Even Queen Elizabeth II acknowledges her role as a public servant and she's actual royalty.  As for our president, I personally don't think Don the Con is mad in the way of George III, he's simply incompetent, unprepared, incurious, arrogant, lazy, and vindictive. Those are not signs of madness but they are characteristics of a bad leader. Perhaps, as with Nixon, the smoking gun will come down to those elusive tapes to which Trump made mention in a tweet. Even if that happens, the Republican majority in Congress will look the other way and block impeachment proceedings in every conceivable way. We've seen this from them before. They will do it again.

The rebellions were, of course, populist uprisings against elite rule. Upper Canada ruled by the Family Compact, Lower Canada ruled by the Chateau Clique. Essentially, farmers and small businessmen were trying, by force of arms, to 'drain the swamp'.  And the erratic behaviour of Donald Trump really isn't all that far from the fiery temper of the man in a red wing who was well known for outrageous commentary via the media of the day,  William Lyon Mackenzie.  But perhaps the outcome of present  U.S. chaos and confusion will be the modern equivalent emergence of calm, reflective men like Robert Baldwin to bring true reform to a broken political system and unfair society.

The U.S. tried to install a puppet regime on that border in Ukraine and bungled it badly and has been sponsoring this kind of Putin-bashing ever since. It's pathetic. Actually, Putin is doing Trump a favor by even meeting with him, as the China-Russia alliance is now the dominant geopolitical entity on the planet while the U.S. has become a fading, blustering nation in decline.

I was wondering what her personal reaction was to Trump's behavior at the debate.  If I was debating him, I would've turned around mid-sentence and got in his face about getting too close.  I actually thought she should have done that.  I think Clinton lost a lot of credibility and respect in that debate because she didn't call Trump out on his menacing behavior.  Couldn't tell if she was actually intimidated, or playing it safe, or unprepared to deal with it, so shocked (shocked apparently, from what she wrote).  I think Clinton lost votes based on the thought processes she describes as reported above.  That's worth reading, I think.

Leaving aside your anti-Trump silliness, of course we should pursue as many promising new trading partners as possible and make free and fair trade deals with them.

Just as important, justify massive spending on its own military which is today about $600 billion before actual war costs.  And, for purely domestic reasons, create a new Cold War on Russia. Because peace have been most painful to the Pentagon.  There is no such thing as a NATO force. NATO members are under no obligation to spend anything for it. They spend on their own defense. Then contribute to NATO as they see fit.  NATO is American military empire. Let the U.S. pay for it. Canada have no need for empire and should get out.

He believes it won the election for Trump.  The Democrats were made the same offer and declined much to their detriment which I am sure they will do during the next election.  So, is social media a threat to democracy if both parties have equal access to their secrets?

1,"As a life-long Democrat who voted Republican for the first time in 2010 (Yes, I voted for Obama's first term!), let me tell you my perspective of what I've learned since Trump's election:  - Democrats are the biggest  dividers of this country, using race, sex, sexuality, religion, immigration, and political correctness as tools to lure voters.  Donald Trump's most racist, misogynist act was that he was a White male who won the Presidency following a Black President, and he beat a woman.  Democrats are sore because they believed that they could win elections based on identity (race, sex) without substance. - Establishment Republicans (now on the way out) like Flake, are no better than Democrats, legislators becoming fat and rich by taking taxpayer money, selling out the country, and throwing crumbs to their voters.  That's just a start of what I've recognized.

A health care bill in which participation is not universal, important funding to support it is relinquished by excluding tax revenue and where states can change the terms of insurance with little substantiation will leave many without coverage. Those who would most suffer are those needing extended care such as the elderly. Although the Republican-controlled Senate's bill may be a little less onerous than the House version, the end result overall means greatly reduced benefits for the most vulnerable among us. This new version of the GOP's replacement of Obamacare, a fundamental campaign promise of President Trump, still appears to be a cure lacking a disease.

Just because a group of people is small, should not change how they are treated.  And I also disagree with the suggestion that one type of trans person would be not allowed over another. My example was more to show that physical/mental requirements to get into the military should still be required. A trans person who recently had surgery done, and is going to need more surgeries, or if they are going to need psychological treatment - I think those should be taken into consideration before allowing them to join or not.  Just like a person with a broken leg would not be allowed in the military until its healed, I would say the same should be applied to someone who goes through any gender changing surgery.  The blanket statement from Trump disregards the trans people who are both physically and mentally able to serve.

Absent the rule change, the Democrats would no doubt now be doing the same thing. There are offices that need to be filled and jobs that need to be done.  Government departments need ministers (the Americans call them Secretaries), administrative tribunals need administrators, and courts need judges.  Even Trump's picks are better than vacant offices.  Given the current dysfunction, allowing filibusters of presidential appointments is a way of ensuring that the government of the US grinds to a halt. For the last two years, the Republicans have had a majority in the Senate, and so there have been effectively no confirmations, leaving Trump a lot of vancancies, including one on SCOTUS, to fill.

How any Catholic can defend this man is beyond belief, and you do defend him.  When Trump brings Ted Nugent into the Oval Office to publicly dress him down for his race baiting, female demeaning commentary, I might start to re evaluate my opinion of Trump.

It will be an Epic implosion that will be studied by Economists for decades.

0,"I don't agree with violence, ever. But a few folks get worked up and step over the line while thousands are civil.  Yet the whole group is called Un- American and invited to leave the country by conservatives.  Protests can lead to war and can lead to changes in the law and changes in beliefs.  It also can send a message to the world and to Trump that most voters did not support him and are unhappy with what he is doing to our country. That message is not a waste of time.

Apparently in order to satisfy these """"wants"""" Canadians are willing to mortgage their future for the short term gains of the present. Governments have been no models of restraint, where provinces like Ontario have managed to double their debt over ten years, and still think everything is just fine. We elected a federal Liberal Government knowing that, they have always been the tax and spend party. We have seen just how much they can spend, we are now waiting for the bill, which inevitably comes with increased taxes. There is no economic magic at play here. When you spend far more then what you have, there is an eventual reckoning. Governments survive of course, , often by passing the debt off to the next party at an election. The consumer is not so lucky, as they have no one to pass their debt off to. When a crash does come, it will be hard, long lasting,and was avoidable.

0,"Bankruptcies are not really important. That is a play the liberals are making to make Trump look bad. Trump operates in RE development. Every project has at least 2 legal companies, if not more. Sometimes bad investments happen (whether economic timing or missed projections) and when that does, those legal entities are left filing for bankruptcy. Have you ever made a bad investment? I know I have.  The difference between Trump and Hillary is Trump is running a business and investing economic projects. He is actively managing wealth through the investments he chooses.  Want to talk lawsuits? Those are also extremely common in real estate development. The fact that he has many is irrelevant. Bankruptcies and lawsuits are part of doing business in real estate development. Everyone, big or small runs across those issues at some point.  I'd rather have a president that knows how to manage debt leveraging to grow revenue, which is what RE development is.

0,"You can't start an intellectual discussion based upon an article by Mr. Burke because the articles are devoid of intellectual content.  Om the one hand he speaks about hate and hate groups and their supposed affiliation with President Trump as though there is some kind of connection.  He then proceeds to make the most hateful and dishonest statements that anyone could make about anyone.  President Trump was exactly correct to denounce all of those who promote divisiveness and violence regardless of political leanings they may have.  It must be pointed out to Mr. Burke that in Charlottesville there was a peaceful march until the uninvited rioters showed up.  The President did not pick sides but he did admonish all hate driven violence.  The Presidents admonishment should extend to people like Mr. Burke whose purpose, it seems. is to generate hate whenever and wherever he can.
"
0,"It is not based upon fact.  Trump’s policy does not have the factual basis that he claims.  The data on terrorism in the United States consistently indicates that the threat largely lies elsewhere. Judge Robart made that point in his ruling.  Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, has arrived at a striking finding: Nationals of the seven countries singled out by Trump have killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and 2015. Trump’s action “is a response to a phantom menace.” 3 Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cuban refugees in the 1970s. Zero by Syrian refugees.  And contrary to Trump's claims Obama did not ban people from the seven listed countries. The Obama administration and Congress had previously designated them as places people couldn’t visit if they planned to participate in the U.S. visa-waiver program - so regular vetting applied - no visa waiver.

1,"The so-called mainstream media (MSM) has nothing for which to apologize. They reported the news accurately with regard to Trump: all of it was verified and true.

His executive orders banning refugees and immigrants from some Muslim majority countries to the United States play right into the hands of our enemies. ISIS has already used his statements to help recruit new suicide bombers, and you can bet Trump’s policies will help inspire attacks against Americans both at home and abroad. “His policies literally put our troops’ lives at risk—I’ve heard this loud and clear when I have visited them overseas. They also prove he has zero understanding of our country’s values and no intention of defending our Constitution. “We are a nation of immigrants, and America is stronger when we welcome the refugees of our enemies. These policies do not put America first. I am ashamed that he is our president."""" I wish to associate myself with Mr. Moulton's statement.

0,"Assuming that the current round of negotiations end next week with no progress, expect Trump (by analogy with his action this week on the Iran Agreement issue) to make clear his dissatisfaction & belief that the US should withdraw from NAFTA 'soon' unless Canada & Mexico meet the demands his negotiators have tabled. This will cause some disruption in markets & much media commentary but will not actually trigger US withdrawal.  In this way, Trump will hope to generate increased anxiety in Canada, Mexico & amongst free-trade proponents domestically in the US but be able to stand apart from the resulting thrashing about and watch for weakness & opportunities that may be exhibited by his opponents in these negotiations.  The danger is that matters might spin out of control to the detriment of all. However, there is a better chance (if Canada etc., remain calm, reasonable but firm) that damage will be limited & the NAFTA issue ultimately be resolved equitably.

The leader of our country is called a ‘president’ because he’s supposed to preside over our society.   His job is to lead, to cajole, to scold, to correct our path, to lift up what is good about us and to absolutely and unequivocally and immediately condemn what is evil in us.  And if he does not do that—if he does not preside over our society—then he is not a president.   You can stand for a nation, or you can stand for a hateful movement.  You can’t do both.  And if you don’t make the right choice, I am confident that the American voter will.”

I'd like to think that Trump's ascendance is at least in part to people believing that things could be managed better and more directly for the benefit of the USA, and both are not as wildly disillusioning as much as a common theme that I'd hope both Kasich and Clinton would accommodate. We actually have a functioning government majority present in the moderated elements of both parties  that can or could do many (good!) things, though is hamstrung by partisan obligations to the gerymandering and primary fears caused by the outer limits of both parties (in fairness, most of this GOP), that now prevent consensus intelligent legislation from making it to a vote.

Trump needs to drop the Taiwan bargaining chip as it is bringing out the bully in China it so carefully hides on the world scene and instead focus on duties and technology transfer bans. He may look to how China moves it currency offshore by buying foreign assets to protect them from its own currency devaluations. You can't sabre rattle with a mindset that builds its own island, in the middle of nowhere, to extend territorial claims.

Along comes Trump however and all he need do is throw some """"Twitter bait"""" over the fence and the guard dogs are instantly distracted. Now Trump  simply walks in and causes significant damage to this property - so much so that the public decides to replace it with something else, somewhere else. The public also begins to question the value of guard dogs for protection and replaces them with electronic security measures that are not as easily distracted.  The public is rather fond of the dogs so it makes sure they find good homes.  This is lingering resentment however that the dogs did not do their jobs.

If he does not realize it, I am sure his Billionaire friends will remind him that they are making a lot of money by having cheap labor available in Mexico. I anticipate Canada will probably fare better than Mexico in the re-negotiations of NAFTA but it probably will not be too bad for Mexico, i think worst case scenario is minus-5% off of Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GNP) for next year. It may cause only a moderate recession and would probably only last for 3 to 5 years,  so at least it will not be severe.

And when Bush got into nation-invading and nation-""""building"""" ... well, that's just about as opposite from conservatism as one could get.

Although Trump approved the raid, it was planned entirely by the Obama administration.  Despite being well-planned and well-rehearsed, the raiding force met with unanticipated resistance, resulting in the death of the Navy SEAL.  Things like this are common occurrences in combat.  No matter how well planned operations may be, problems almost always occur during execution.   Military commanders normally prepare after action reports to identify and analyze what went right, what went wrong and what might be done to prevent recurrences of things that went wrong, but it is not normal or reasonable to conduct Investigations every time an American is KIA.

That includes so called establishment republicans that are no more than lukewarm democrats. The ones who told us they were going to do something to stop Obama and Obamacare and then did not do anything but lay down for the liberal agenda. They betrayed us and we got angry. Racism or sexism has nothing to do with it. Of course ever since Obama was elected, we have been painted as racist just disagreeing with any policy he puts forth, never mind that we disagree with his policies and race has nothing to do with that.

Many of the figures in his orbit were at least in the business of shepherding money out of those countries into New York real estate.   In many or most cases the FBI and the DOJ suspected them of money laundering and ties to organized crime.  http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/follow-the-money--4  You're going to want to have a listing of the cast of characters when the investigations crank up.

0,"It will be difficult to communicate my point without getting censored, but I'll try. The Conservative Party, much like the Republicans south of the border, has become the party that caters predominately to the least well educated voter. Candidates with serious ideas and proposals, like Chong, have actually been booed on stage, while populist positions like those of Leitch are well received. In that environment, O'Leary is a favorite simply because of his celebrity and bombast (much like Trump), and Bernier is popular because he looks good and says """"smaller government"""" a lot.  The leadership race must be viewed as a struggle for the approval of the Conservative voting base. That base, the 30+ percent of voters that voted for Harper last time, has views massively out of line with mainstream Canadian thinking. Winning means attracting the majority of those votes.

A businessman's logic doesn't say, """"China evil, we will bury them."""" Rather, it notes what his business needs and explores how to get there. And he doesn't care that a business rival says that buying their subsidiary is non-negotiable.

The war on coal miners has always been waged by people like that, Dem and GOP both. And the miners always lost. History repeats itself: the first time is tragedy, the second time farce. Trump's winning the """"war on coal"""" is the farce.

In sheerly practical terms, it simply isn't as egregious as e.g. attacking the rights of racial minorities, or women, there's a large enough body of people here to agree with Trump that it's not going to lose him the support of his base.

The resolution cannot be applied retroactively and has no immediate practical consequences. Since it was adopted under Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter, it cannot be forced on Israel. Only resolutions passed under Chapter 7 can be imposed.

And that Trump himself tweeted: """"As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th."""" One of the existing possibilities is for Trump to threaten to cut the UN's funding if it tries to impose sanctions on Israel.

The second type glorifies the ability to exercise corporate (and) management power over both product markets and labor markets.  That is liberty for the few and it is what Cato, Acton and company are really defending because, after all, the wealthy and their CEOs deserve what they are getting. This secular form of the prosperity gospel (which is the heart of conservatism) is what the Church condemns.  The question that we argue about is how to remedy this concentration of power without making things worse.

0,"That is the biggest load of twisted logic and """"alternative facts"""" I have ever seen! Russia hated Hillary for a reason: she's tough on our arch-enemy Russia"""". She wouldn't have kissed Putin's rear the way that Trump does. And news flash for you: Russia hacked the RNC server also. That was widely reported. Another news flash: The Republican led witch hunt over Hillary's emails amounted to nothing. Obama's mistake was that he didn't want to be seen as influencing the election and he knew that Hillary would take action on our arch-enemy the Russians after she took office. But the big question is why does Trump continue to deny that the Russians meddled? Even you with your limited knowledge of current events acknowledge they did....
"
0,"It's seems to me like the author is not paying attention to what the 45 president has said. The real reason Obama cannot get out of politics is because the current president keeps bribing his name up.  Trump has had and continues to have an obsession with Obama. When Obama left office he promised the American people he would speak up when something was not right. You have a problem with something he promised the American people he would do. If President Trump focused on the problems facing America instead of the media coverage, twitter, and trying to prove himself maybe he would get somewhere. I would just like to finish off with a few great things Obama did during his presidency. Save the American auto industry, get the economy back on track, reestablish relations with Cuba, Paris climate accord, Trans pacific, LGBT, Wall Street reform, improved americas image globally and healthcare reform. It was not perfect but it was a basis that so many presidents had attempted and failed.

But a few exceptions to a rule does not negate the overall truth of the rule.  Look at the actual GOP agenda, not the spin masters.  The first thing George W. did was to give giant tax breaks to the 1% and dismantle social programs for the 99%.  Trump tried to eliminate the Affordable Care Act to take away health care from 20 million Americans to give a huge tax break to the 1%.  All GOP legislators went along, except for three, and all Democrats voted against this.  These are just two examples of so many instances of GOP siding with the 1% against the 99%.  By the way, your link incorrectly names many Republican contributors as Democrats such as Sheldon Adelson, Robson Walton, Alice Walton, and Lawrence Ellison,  (who supported Marco Rubio’ in 2016).  Again, look at what the GOP actually does and attempts to do, not at their spin.

So in his mind he was always right and did not need any correction. No one wants or expects that in the President-elect Trump administration.  It will likely be similar to the Reagan administration when he hired James Baker (establishment) as chief of staff, while his two main ideological supporters Deaver and Meese were assigned to high ranking places in his administration.  So no, it is only wishful thinking and your projection of fantasies that makes you expect the administration to descend to chaos.  Constructive conflict is not chaos.

Their greatest overreach was in enacting the Parital Birth Abortion Act to force the SCOTUS to reconsider Roe (which was entirely unsuccessful). The only benefit to that saga was to get Trump to mention it and have Hillary answer to rile her base rather than continuing the Obama meme that the law should be adjusted, but there is a law already and that the movement itself was all about elections and not about the unborn.

The fact is that he has a progressive message and policy positions that are wildly popular with the people.

People hated Clinton so much that they voted for an unhinged lunatic because he lied and presented himself as a populist who at least addressed their woes.

After years of trying, they never have found anything to convict her on. Even the FBI, who very obviously disliked Clinton, had to admit that she had done nothing criminal with regard to her emails. The whole point of all of those investigations was to turn the ignorant American public against her. Even after all of the years of investigation and constant reminders in the press, Hillary Clinton still won the popular vote by almost 2 million votes. They should not have allowed Trump to settle. To do so is a disgrace - just like he is.

0,"I think I see what's going on here but it's just a theory.  The threshold question is why Trump doesn't order Sessions to just respond to the subpoena.  Maybe the answer is so bad that it undermines not just the moral foundation of the United States Department of Justice but the federal government itself.  For why else would the #2 at Justice, Rod Rosenstein, be making the rounds instead of the Senate liaison?  Maybe Comey's FBI did illegally fund the purchase of the Trump dossier through a cutout.  And maybe then the FBI, Eric Holder, Susan Rice, et al used the Trump dossier to justify the FISA wiretapping warrant of Paul Manafort to be able to monitor Trump.  Maybe the corruption rises so high up at the FBI and the CIA and the Justice Department that it potentially undermines all federal investigations that can be linked to it, even tangentially.  Maybe it's so bad it could undermine the public confidence in the federal government itself such that there really would be anarchy.

I can accept that neither Obama nor any White House official ORDERED the surveillance, but I do not believe they were unaware of a request for a warrant for a wiretap that would possibly involve the Republican candidate for President or members of the Trump campaign, like General Flynn.   Being aware and not stopping it is tacit approval.

0,"Get your reading glasses on and open your listening ears, Pluto.  Trump has been priming the so-called civil war pump for the past two months.  He knows he's likely to lose this election and won't take voter rejection.  Trump's narcissistic temperament will try to ignite a mob rule mentality and when people start dying over his sorry caracas he'll dump them and blame the mob for misinterpreting his civil war message.  Trump has already advocated assassinating Hillary and tried to back away from that message.  Go right ahead and keep following him.  Right off the proverbial cliff.

We should be striving for a considered dialogue on the issues raised by player protestors with a bias toward corrective action collectively rather than this petty, ego driven desire by the White House to demand players stand against their will to satisfy Trump's authoritarian view of the world where patriotism is defined by unquestioned allegiance to flag and country for which he is the President.

Maybe Columbia, Panama, Ecuador, Venezuela can take in some to help out.  Not likely. It's only the US, and now Canada (not dealing with Europe here) that are guilted into ruining their countries by helping others, before they help their own citizens.

You might want to tell that to Donald Trump. As far as I can tell most on the left have been critical of Obama's use of drone strikes. Even Jon Stewart called him out on that. Whereas the right has been critical that Obama hasn't done more, e.g., Syria. So which is it, has Obama been too """"adventurous"""" or not enough? And BTW, Libya is a civil war.

When I play salon (home) concerts) on a Steinway 'B' (unmiked), acoustic bass (no amp), drums, sax/trumpet, the dynamic range is huge. The sound is UN COLOURED by any technology, the band balances itself and the audience is drawn in, in a way that leaves them awe struck. The say they never experienced music like that... ever. Sadly, most people have never heard music where the energy of the sound itself is produced SOLELY by the calories burned by the musicians.

Remember also that Trump's experience in making New York commercial deals is to start with """"shock & awe"""" but compromise at later stages where expedient.

Under Trump, expect inflation and massive price increases across the board.  This ship is sinking faster than Trump’s approval rating. Trump’s coverup is getting tinier than his hands too.

Is this what we want... an angered world ramping up shows of force?  And this is assuming Trump has a coherent strategy about China and Taiwan rather than one morning thinking, """"Hmm, I've got some developments being planned in Taiwan, let's give them a call and butter them up a bit"""".

0,"I think its a logical assumption because you make your case with such fervor about the importance of popular votes due to your loyalty to Hillary Clinton. Jimmy Carter in 1976 barely had a majority but yet he acted as if he won every single vote and made changes as he saw fit. And as much as I hated him, I also realized he got that right. Every president in the history of our nation, has the ultimate mandate for change  regardless of the popular vote or even if he won the electoral college by just one vote. Trump's mandate is neither weak or strong. It don't matter. Just remember that in 1960, JFK won by just .2% of the popular vote. In 1876, Hayes lost by 3% of the popular votes but still won the electoral college and he made massive changes like ending the Reconstruction prematurity. In 1886, Benjamin Harrison won by mere .8%.  You want to handicap Trump by saying that he lack the popular votes to make changes. It don't work that way and never did, never will work that way.

Can they then judge the president for what he said? You can have a different standard than yourself if it applies to the president.

0,"Reforming grid (FERC) regulations that discriminate against nuclear (which Trump and Co. may do) is important.  So is giving nuclear proper credit for its no-polluting nature (which Trump is unlikely to do).  However, nuclear's main problem is high costs (both construction and operation), and those are primarily driven by excessive and relentlessly increasing NRC regulations and fab QA requirements.  While this article gave a couple of examples of excessive requirements, it only scratched the surface.  Construction costs are more than triple what they were back In the '70s (in real dollar terms) and operations costs have ~doubled.  Most of this is due to excessive and increased regulations, and it corresponds to tens of billions of dollars per year in unnecessary expense.  This is what the Trump administration needs to look into (although it is unlikely that they will spend the political capital, as they are actually pro-fossil).

0,"Many citizens suspect, but do not know, that there is voter fraud happening in our elections. Many other citizens suspect, but do not know, that there is voter suppression happening. Both groups do not believe that studies done have asked the right questions or had access to all information needed to answer the questions definitively. Both groups selectively believe studies that support their suspicions.  The result is that, one way or the other, nearly everyone has suspicions about the fairness and validity of our elections. This undermines the very basis of our liberty, that our government is of the people, by the people, and for the people; that we each have a fair say, though small, in how we are governed.  Despite the editorialist's speculation (and that's all it is) on President Trump's intention, the better reason is to expose our election processes to the light of day so all know whether to trust them or not, then make change if needed. Why hasn't it been done sooner?

They may want to portray themselves as Patriots, but they are anything but. What they are, as we have seen, are smooth talking salesmen for the Globalist Agenda. Supporting Hillary and Obama as they do, makes them tacitly complicit in their actions  and explains exactly why baby Jed  got 'tromped' in the primaries.

Maybe his father was in the US military, stationed in Bavaria when he was born.  or maybe his dad knocked up a German fraulein--they were never married, but his father's name is on the birth certificate. Maybe he was illegally here. Maybe he had a Visa. Maybe the US deported him.  Germany's citizenship requirements are no doubt different than the US, so who cares?    The discussion of US citizenship and immigration status is irrelevant to the story--and off on a TOTAL tangent. He committed the crime in Germany, now Germany and the Associated Press have both labelled him as riff-raff with a criminal history, who had been staying with his father in Colorado most recently. That's it.    The story is about his crime--not his passport stamps, his birth certificate, or his United States citizenship status, and certainly not about Trump politics.

0,"I have to say.  After looking at a longer video (obviously available on Fox and other conservative media sources) it doesn't look like a snub so much as a bit of over-eagerness on Trump's part.  His face doesn't look perturbed (he just looks bored to me) as Agata goes to Melania when Trump shook Duda's hand and the look doesn't change when she continues on that path. Perhaps it was a snub, perhaps not.  Perhaps Trump is getting better at hiding his emotions from his face.  But either way, I have to say this isn't good reporting (nor is Fox et. al calling CNN """"deceptive"""") as it seems to rely on a great deal of artistic license and preys on already existing partisan sentiments.

Not many Canadians were thrilled with the election of Donald Trump nor were many Americans but he simply was the lightening rod for a great many people that were fed up with the establishment politicians that chronically failed to deliver on their promises. The liberal/left/progressives made a significant political blunder by assuming it was Trump rather than change that American's were voting for and proceeded to identify this constituency with the candidate.  By vilifying, denigrating, and generally offending that constituency, they simply inflamed their resolution to oust those who hand not only lost touch with them but who were holding them in obvious contempt. Canada and Canadians would be making the same mistake by following the advice of progressives who continue to hold similar views.

In the event of another crisis, the government will 'ease' with a lower dollar and other measures.

The fact that Politifact said it was a personal return is not compelling.  The fact that Trump mentioned that others' concerns might be involved suggests to me that Trump did not mean simply his personal concern.  The bottom line here is that Politifact did not set out the precise assumptions used in making a false determination.  Among the key assumptions is that the return is purely personal.  Trump did not say that in his statement.  I saw no discussion of how Politifact determined precisely what type of return was under discussion.  Also, it should be noted that Trump as CEO of an S corp would have an fiduciary obligation to minimize taxes the corp paid directly (if any).  In total, a complex situation in which a conclusive false is not helpful to anyone and appears purely politically motivated.

At this point I question whether Nunes even understands what he purports to have read. One thing is crystal clear: He is scared & was scared enough to run right over to Trump and spill the beans. Nunes may even be involved. It's certain that he shouldn't have been discussing classified information with Trump, & definitely not discussing it in a press conference. I'm amazed that he did.  I'm sure he expects Trump will protect him. But he may not be able to. The  bottom line is that I believe all of the intelligence sources over Nunes, hands down. There no doubt whatsoever that Nunes crossed the line & there's no going back.

If the act of a candidate that some people disagree with showing up to give a speech is enough to cause a riot, that really says a tremendous amount about us as a society.  Also, to anyone who plans to protest, I'd like to give you one piece of advice:  Every time you shout down a Trump supporter and it makes the news, he goes up two or more points in the polls. There are a lot of people that really don't like Trump, but they dislike people stepping on other's rights even more and are pushed closer to Trump every time someone tries to stifle him.  It makes one wonder who's side the protesters are really on.  We're all adults. Let him speak and let the people decide how they feel about what he says.

1,"The author is missing the elephant in the room.  I am not a paid political pundit but I saw a Trump victory days after his announcement of his intention to run in the primary.  Trump won for two distinct reasons.  Firstly, he is genuine.  People are sick and tired of politicians repeating the same focused group catch phrases and talking points and Trump spared no expense in this regard.  Rosie O'Donnell DOES have a fat, ugly face.  Fiorna DOES look like Skeletor.  GW Bush DIDNT have the IQ to be President, and the last thing anyone needed was another Bush in the White house.  Secondly, Clinton was so uninspiring and boring that when she spoke you wanted to just change the channel.  With Trump, whether you liked him or hated him, you wanted to hear what he had to say.  It was like a tea candle trying to compete with a tiger torch for oxygen.  Democrats couldn't have picked a more boring candidate.

0,"No matter how much you try to shine it up, Trump is the most unqualified person to be POTUS that has ever been through the primaries.  Trump is incredibly dangerous to this country.

The destruction of the Republican party is already assured.
"
1,"""""...the hopelessly immature Donald Trump ...""""  I think that statement right there is the key to  the whole Trump thing.  Trump is a guy who really has no idea what to do about much of anything so he remains in thrall to those who can manipulate his simplistic intellect.  Bannon for one is a master at it.  There are the Mercers, of course, and certainly Adelson.  Trump basically just lunges from one tweeted thought to the next.  Sometimes he speaks with a modicum of fluency but that is only because he is reading from some script.  Trump is not a Republican - - he's a Trumpian and nothing more.

0,"What I find absolutely amazing is how many bloggers in the G&M defend Trump. How can you? Do you think his lies are o.k.? The man is a dangerous know-nothing and corrupt, as a lot of Republicans are. There is ample proof of that. If not contained, he will become a despot. Having family members in positions of power is a good start.  He has no idea how anything he wants to do affects his own country. He does know how to reduce his income taxes if his 'plan' were ever enacted. It won't! I wonder whether a lot of you would think differently if we had a Trump in Canada. You might want to read, for example, the Washington Post to find out what American bloggers have to say.  But then it is their country and they have to live with the fallout.  Comey was absolutely not fired because of Clinton. He was fired because he was investigating the Russian connection. More shoes will drop! What Trump needs now is a good war to detract everyone.

0,"Because of the lack of rational critical debate from both sides, you see people who I'm sure are completely reasonable in most respects actually trying to justify what happened in Quebec. Freedom and free speech means being able to disagree with fundamentalist Islam and being in favour of stopping its fascist aims without being immediately mislabelled as an Islamophobe. It also means being able to criticize some of Trump's policies and the anti-Muslim hate speech without being called a left wing lunatic. The kind of totally biased nonsense coming from the US mainstream media is triggering a similar right-wing reaction on alternative media. Hopefully opinion leaders on both sides will come to their senses before more extremist and radical lunatics on both sides are triggered and feel like they have to take change the world themselves.

Drone a bomb here, fire a missile there, send troops to Somalia, build a monument or a wall here, now tear it down - all by executive order.  Besides the disturbing loss of a balance of power between the three branches of government, and the obscene political shenanigans, the real issue with PMNM is conserving resources for future generations, or maximizing short term profits. Both valid points for discussion.  Unfortunately, human history has shown numerous times that humans have a habit of extracting a resource right up to extinction of the resource. A grand Pacific example is defoliating Easter Island. Trump and Co. may be draining the national swamp to strip mine it. I guessing.

0,"For those who claim that Hillary won the popular vote for the UNITED STATES, a little arithmetic to set you all straight.   Hillary Clinton got (latest count)  8,362,490 votes cast in the state of CALIFORNIA.  Donald Trump got (latest count) 3,916,209  votes cast in the state of CALIFORNIA.  That means that Hillary Clinton won the state of CALIFORNIA by 4,446,281 (latest count).  The claim by Liberals is that Hillary Clinton won 65,844,610 votes  NATIONALLY and Donald Trump  won 62,979,636 votes NATIONALLY which gives her a margin of 2,864,874 votes NATIONALLY.  Last time I checked CALIFORNIA was one of fifty one states that decide who is elected president.  So for all the other fifty states Donald Trump  won the popular vote by 1,581,307 votes.   Considering  California is ruled by Governor Moonbeam and is a sanctuary state for illegal aliens with California  driver's licenses, and the potential for at least a million illegal votes is highly probable.  And that be today' lesson.

No one in Trump's cabinet seem to be experts or advocates of small business, who are often made worse off from regulations. Once the Chamber of Commerce reminds them of this, the deregulation fad will wear off.  Health care reform as passed already championed big-government Republicanism.  The Ryan/McCain model makes economic sense, provided that you consider health care a normal good, which it is not. Their approach, which eventually will replace all comprehensive insurance, will never receive popular support.  The only way to go that makes progress is single payer with some kind of employer based consumption (rather than payroll) tax (profit should be taxed too), with offsets for employers who provide alternative medical care.  Dogs are spiritual and Ambrose is no exception.  Our hearts go out to him.

We're talking about intelligent people in government and private sector not able to get to produce ice for an ice rink in not one, not 2, not 3, but 6 years.  Doing it in only 4 months is like doing it with a magic bullet. Trump's 10-point immigration proposal is innovative, common sense and effective.

0,"To begin with, what the public thinks of the newsworthiness of a story is irrelevant. The newsworthiness of a particular event is determined by editors and to a minor extent reporters. In more than 20 years of being a freelance journalist, I was never told by an editor to take a poll of a sliver of the public to determine if I should go ahead and cover a particular story or not. Secondly, the issue isn't whether the Billy Kenoi drunken toast """"scandal"""" isn't newsworthy per se but whether it was a significant enough story in and of itself. Clearly from my perspective it was newsworthy. However, it wasn't much of a news story. Finally, Brett's point on individual decisions in the news media is an excellent one and sadly, poorly understood by the public. Most people see the news media as plural and not singular. They don't understand that different newspapers, TV stations, websites make different decisions everyday. For Example: Take the NY Times Story on Trump's taxes.

That being the case, they will """"govern"""" the same way they have been: by obstructing every initiative Clinton sends their way. In essence, non-governing. Heck, Ted Cruz may even try to shut down the government again just because he's mad that he didn't win.

Just as important as the dollar amount is the fact that it's not so much the pages that cost money, it's the environmental studies that cost money, and the amount will be proportionate to how large and complex the project is.

The huge debt the GOP likes to blame Obama for...trillions plus interest on our war debt. Remember the wall street rip off and the robosigners?  Let's face it, Trump is not the problem in this country, he is merely an expression of the horror that was already happening. That is why GOP bickering might eventually help us.

0,"nope you are wrong again, like dd.  a sitting senator cannot use his office to campaign for another person.  but as senator, he can campaign for another as an individual.  he cannot use senatorial resources to campaign for another - sessions held a meeting with the ambassador in his senate office.  this is a no-no.  he could have legally had a meeting with the ambassador if it took place at campaign headquarters or any other place while he was actively campaigning for trump.  in the meeting with the ambassador which took place in his senate office was not done to discuss his duties as senator but as a campaigner for trump.  a non-government person cannot discuss legally discuss American foreign policy with any foreign government official.  they can make small take or talk about anything else other than government business.   one can be tried for treason, if he divulges secret info of the us government.

It's logo was the scales of justice, with a marijuana leaf at one end and a grape cluster (wine) at the other. We were able to block the sheriff from a number of nasty busts and almost got rid of  the county's forfeiture law.  Most of the evils we opposed were dealt with by Oregon's new law discussed by Motley.  We can expect  Sessions to be hot for eliminating Oregon's legal marijuana sales.

Not sure how EPA works in AK , does the Fed EPA give permission to the State EPA? If so I would bet the Fed can take all regulation back at will and tweet in new regs, after of course getting the maximum contributions from the owners. Trump will probably want to gild most of the White house anyway as that's what his house is like and what a great connection to the working class of America. The workers of course may not see any streams but can expect to see much new alpine type mountains in all directions, good luck with your groundwater. Really nobody lives on the Pebble prospect and why would anyone want to live in West Virginia or any other coal site, we still need a nuclear waste site and Duke energy has all those ash waste pits.

0,"Obama is a private citizen; I'm sure he can file suits as he sees fit.  I'm not an attorney, though, and so I don't know whether there is some sort of privilege that protects a sitting president from civil suits. Trump tweets his drivel from a private Twitter account and from his own phone, and that may make it more difficult to invoke whatever privilege might attach to his office. I'd like to see Obama get some Trump money for his presidential library; but more than that, I'd love to see what sort of defense Trump would mount: Diminished capacity??

0,"I won't sit here and say that Gary Johnson was the ideal candidate, but here's what it boils down to......  Between Johnson, Clinton, and Trump....which candidate would I trust to handle my personal finances, which directly impacts my life and those of my family?  Hilary Clinton- Likely to be irresponsible in handling my personal information, but probably wouldn't steal from me.....and has serious personality issues.  Major ethical and moral flaws.  Donald Trump- Likely to find a way to screw me if it meant adding to his own bank account.  Kind of hard to ignore 70 years of history....both from a business and personality standpoint.  Even worse ethical and moral flaws than HRC.  Gary Johnson- Self-made man.  Probably not perfect, but no major character flaws I can see.  Successful governor.  Johnson needs work on foreign policy, but that can be improved upon with the right people around.  Very pro-personal freedom (more than ANY Republican could hope to be).  The choice was obvious.

American poverty is for the most part hidden/ stashed away as in a 'back closet'' in the small towns...mountains...... shacks of the South and Midwest etc.  the election made us accept the reality of an America that is lost and hidden that needs to be cherished,  respected and elevated as much as any other ethnic.. sexual ... religious entity in this country.

And this: Trump's """"aim is purely to ensure U.S. security, not engage in foreign adventurism as former president George W. Bush did when he invaded Iraq. “We are not nation-building again,” [Trump] said. “We are killing terrorists.”  Nation-building?  Gen.

0,"When these groups are organizing and killing people in the streets is not the time to give them forgiveness. It's the time to stand up against them and make the voice of peace, tolerance, and inclusion LOUDER than their message of hate and intolerance.  I'll go out on a limb here but I think Jackie Robinson would agree.  By being complacent with racism and bigotry you are part of encouraging it. The KKK was emboldened by Trump's response. The white supremacist groups considered it a victory. They're organizing and running for office. They are planning more demonstrations. Standing up against this doesn't make you a hateful intolerant person - the opposite of their message is incapable of being hateful and bigoted because that is exactly what they stand for.  What I am saying is there should be is more counter protests, more public condemnation of them and those who support them. They should not peddle their message of hate and feel respect and tolerance.

0,"The article is good, and so are many of the comments, but all of this thinking still kind of scares me.  During the election, Trump's ideas and statements were routinely mocked and debunked, yet he still won.  As has been stated many times, his genius is in marketing to his base; finding the message that resonates with them and sticking to it.  His tweets are still the most important message to many of his followers, and if they are going to read anything else, it will likely still be the Breitbart's of the world, stating that the real issue is finding the leakers.  Someone smarter than me has to figure out how best to communicate with Trump's base.  All of them will not change their minds, but some will.

Understand - this was an interpretation and implementation of HHS - it is not a key part of the ACA and yet the USCCB opposed the PPACA based upon this HHS ruling.  That is like the tail wagging the dog and in opposition to most catholic associations, non-profits, NGOs, etc. that saw that the PPACA was a step towards responding to a gospel imperative.  Sad!

You could probably say the same thing about his other ideas.  It's Trump's style of negotiating: determine a firm point where you would be willing to walk away, try to figure out the other side's walk-away point, then make a first offer that's crazy, but not so crazy that they will walk away. You'll usually get a compromise that's better than you would have got if your first offer was reasonable.

The Trump is currently breaking the Affordable Care Act, as well as entire governmental agencies; he has already broken international treaties and severely damaged ties with our international allies.  And now, the Trump expects our totally dysfunctional Congress to clean up his mess.  Maybe this IS what we need! When Congress realizes that the Trump administration has no clue, no ideas, no help to offer, and is a hindrance to progress of any sort, perhaps congressmen and women will get back to work, together, and starting fixing things.

My thoughts I use to write my comments in response to articles like this one comes from all of those sources. I go back to a comment I posted here at NCR the day after the election last November, that perhaps we need to go through this (a Trump presidency) in order to regain or refresh our understanding of just how far off course our democracy has gone, how fragile it really is, and how a growing segment of our population is extremely reactionary, uneducated in democratic processes, and in possession of attitudes and beliefs that spring from the deeply negative and distorted cesspools of human cognition.  As a result, the avid supporters of DJT, as small a number as they indeed are now, can never be expected to be thoughtful, reasonable or open to dialogue. (continued)

But legacy news outlets can't deflect to fake news from Russia. It was the collective wisdom of mainstream media, for example, that Trump should receive ten times more coverage and mention in the media than Bernie Sanders (the coherent anti-establishment guy).  And that brings us to the real problem with legacy news: the fact its priorities and focus are blatantly those of its highly concentrated ownership. Ownership that cares not one whit about journalistic ethics let alone democratic principles. Giving more money to those puppet masters is akin to bailing out Wall Street only to discover executive bonuses had doubled.

0,"Watching Trump try to excuse the increasing riotous behavior at his rallies brings the truth of this letter home. He has on numerous times goaded his supporters to take down or even punch anyone at his rally who voices opposition. Sure, some of those opponents are rude, but does that really mean they can be punched? I watched Hannity last night defend Trump, implying that the anger shown on each side was the result of Obama. He said he knew that Trump was """"kidding"""" when he called for people to use violence, with Trump responding that he was just """"playing with the crowd"""".  Even Megyn Kelly overcame Trump's crude below the belt insinuations of her abilities to take the side of Trump in the mess in Chicago. There is no honor in this candidate, the media that smells fresh meat, or the latest endorsers who at once called Trump crazy or power hungry. The Democratic candidates have their problems. But all that gets headlines is that they """"interrupt each other"""". Move on, nothing here to see.

0,"I agree that there are different levels of danger to Trump's lies. But I honestly doubt he has the depth of intellect to have formed any kind of coherent plan around them. I think Trump lives entirely in the moment, and almost everything he says is on impulse.  However, the same is not true of those around him, especially Bannon. So the question is, how much influence do his advisers have on Trump? My fear is that Trump will be content to let them run the show because the alternative would be to take a true leadership role that he knows, in his heart of hearts, he isn't qualified for.  I expect as this administration goes on and the water gets deeper around him, Trump will only get more defensive and his episodes of lashing out will get increasingly vicious. This will be especially true if there actually does turn out to be a smoking gun regarding the Russia business. I have a feeling what we've seen so far is nothing compared to the ugliness to come.

"
0,"Exactly.  With all this 'false fact' fur flying about, I'm reminded that throughout my life, I've felt our mainstream media had a definite slant (generally left wing but not always), and that while media couldn't outright lie due to our copyright and libel laws, facts could be massaged to fit what someone wanted people to think about a topic.  One example is the endless streams of studies (some with as few as 20 in the sample group) used to illustrate an idea someone wants to sell, even though studies with tiny sample groups are almost meaningless.  In some ways I find this subtle orientation of facts more disturbing than outright lies.  Outright lies are easily disproven (as we're seeing with Trump and his coterie).  Subtle misdirection can be harder to pin down.  My feeling is that others in the population have felt this vague unease for a long time as well,  without knowing quite what it was.  This may explain the gleeful finger pointing at media by them.

I can't read your tripe and not laugh. But to attack our Democracy is a low life shot, screw you Tim.

For example(s): """"Trump....a man endored by the Ku Klux Klan..."""" while advocating for the only other option that Americans had in their recent election, you are conveniently ignoring the FACT that Hillary is caught on video intentionally praising the passing of her close friend and high ranking KKK member Byrd (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8zOKO6fugo).  With a little more effort (or integrity) you would have found it is absolutely NOT illegal in the  USA.  Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act states: """"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the US would be detrimental to the interests of the US, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or impose on the entry any restrictions he deems appropriate

When he is sworn in as the President, he will need to develop a plan of action, generally applied, that would create the incentive for businesses to keep their employees here.  Profit is really amoral which is something Trump should be personally familiar.  It took a 7 million dollar incentive, a give-away, for Carrier to comply.  That doesn't bode well here.

To think that a racist/fascist is remotely pro-life is intellectually dishonest and morally bankrupt. Does a person with pro-life values mock the handicapped?  Her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Clinton has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Trump ever has or ever will.  Over most of his life, he has been militantly pro-choice. When Chris Matthews asked Trump about his evolution on abortion, it was clear that Trump had not given the issue even five minutes of thought. There is no evidence that he cares about it.

They ignore the fact that ACA is in its death throes (as Democrats planned) and something has to be done to fix or replace it.  After creating the problem, Democrats are pretending to ride in on their white horses--except the only fix they have is essentially Socialized medicine.  Many of the problems Trump is trying to correct are problems created by Obama and the Democrats.  Obama dilly-dallied, talked, promised, pontificated, lied, whined, blamed, and pretended but, in the end, he left a mess for the next guy (who was supposed to be a gal) to clean up.

She didn't intend to denigrate anyone, rather the opposite, but this incident demonstrates how many white people just don't have a clue, even after they read a book detailing racism. It was arrogance on her part to think that just because she read a book detailing racism and was fired up about it that that somehow gave her permission to reproduce and re-enact the black-face tradition that mocks and derides African-Americans. How could she think no one would take a photograph of her? How could she not consider this possibility? She was astoundingly stupid.

Top talent (designers, engineers, construction cos, etc.) only works with top respectful investors/developers.  My former company walked away from a $40 million dollar investment because of reputation of the investor. All of the other large developers did the same.

0,"I was just about to make the same comment about BS's post. Here's what I believe. Had Trump been President the last 8 years we likely would not have ad 500,000 plus murders in the Middle East. I doubt thousands of armored US military  vehicles would not be in the hands of ISIS. I doubt Trump would have met wit the Muslim Brotherhood. I doubt deserter  Bergdal (sp?) would have been traded for top ISIS military commanders, and finally , I doubt Iran would have received billions of dollars as the prime sponsor of terror around the world. All downplayed by the press, by the way.

"
0,"My understanding of the rationale for the Senate was to tamp down the democratic and often unruly deliberative processes of the House and allow calmer voices to prevail. Like the Roman Senate, it was meant to be filled with elders (""""senex"""" = elder) who took their time and thought through issues the House may have given short shrift. Less responsive to popular pressure because of six-year terms, the Senate has used the filibuster to suit its purposes: extending debate rather than cutting it off prematurely because one party or the other is in power. (My understanding of US government may be faulty here, so I welcome input from those who know the subject better.) I'm also not sure this is a helpful strategy for Democrats, since the Gorsuch nomination, if confirmed, leaves the Court in essentially the same position as it was with Scalia. I'm not sure it's a good strategy to hand Mr. Trump a carte blanche to nominate whomever he wants to replace Ginsburg or Kennedy in future.

0,"Trump's military strike on Syria may have been an about-face, but it was a completely justified one. The article is correct that """"Mr. Assad's brutality was well-known long before this week,"""" and that candidate Trump had espoused a less interventionist approach with respect to Assad, but that was based on the Syrian leader's apparent commitment to refrain from gassing civilians. Assad's brutal decision to resume gas attacks, in clear violation of international norms, changed the equation, and the White House's position changed accordingly.  Instead of recognizing Trump's decision as a reasonable response to an extraordinary event, the article searches for a less noble rationale for the strike, such as domestic politics or a desire to appear tough, with scant evidence to back it up. Had a Clinton, Bush or Obama carried out the exact same action, it is questionable whether such a vigorous attempt at impugning the President's motives would have been made.

His responsibility as a self employed private sector citizen was to his company, family and employees. Government is ware money goes to die period. Who can truly say they paid extra out of the goodness of their harts? Who can say they wouldn't take advantage of any legal loopholes?

0,"By the same logic, Mr. Trump, if he were actually encouraging violence, could have easily said so in a very obvious and clear manner. He did not. I can think of interpretations of his remark that would not involve violence, and others that would follow the intentions of the writers of the Constitution and the Second Amendment to dissuade its long standing meaning from being changed by methods other than those proscribed in the Constitution. Hillary's intention is to change the Constitution by unconstitutional means, appointing a liberal judge who with the existing liberals on the Supreme Court would reinterpret the meaning the Second Amendment has had for 224 years. If she (and perhaps you) wants to change the Constitution, she should do it by legal means; otherwise the entire Constitution is meaningless. This is the point Trump was making, and is far more important than any reinterpretation of his comment you or others might might choose to make up in order to make Mr. Trump look bad.

This meeting was set up with the understanding that the Russian lawyer had dirt on a political opponent. They went to that meeting with the intent of gaining information that could be used to harm their opponent's campaign. It turned out to be a bait and switch, but it was more likely a test. What this demonstrates is the Trump campaign was willingly seeking out the help of a foreign entity to assist in winning an election. In other words, the Russian campaign to interfere with the election was based on the fact that they knew they could easily get the Trump campaign to take the bait. And apparently it worked.

1,"Exactly, the issue is Trump's blatant hypocrisy. Immigration has always been an issue in our country. I always find it curious that throughout our history, there have been nativist anti-immigrant xenophobia even as we were founded as a nation of and by immigrants. Perhaps it is psychological projection of guilt for forcibly taking land that already belonged to actual native people and using slave labor to prosper.  Donald Trump is not remotely interested in immigration reform, you can see that for yourself in the two very disparate speeches he gave yesterday in Mexico and in Arizona. While in Mexico, he said nothing about Mexico """"sending criminals to the U.S."""", nothing about """"Mexico paying for the wall"""" he is going to build, and nothing about Mexico's """"unfair trading and labor practices"""". But then hours later, he did the exact opposite in Arizona. Trump has no core principles, and so he lacks decency and empathy, which is evident in his speeches and in his business history.

Trump is the public face of his covert efforts to implement the Project for a New American Century in its entirety. Cheney, using G.W. Bush as a foil, got the ball rolling and Bannon is here to finish the job. Bannon's strategy to discredit the legitimate press by having them chase confirmations of tidbits he throws out there, incrementally and strategically, has done its job.  Trump's 95% (ers) believe only two sources, FOX and Trump's tweets, and have been conditioned to see anyone presenting facts or the truth as enemies of the state and their great leader, Trump. Trump's autocratic oligarchy has barely taken shape and America is, already, in a downward spiral morally and ethically. The worrisome part is that Canada has its share of neo cons who offered blind devotion to Harper's regime and it could happen again.

The reality is that freedom has recently taken significant backward steps in such major powers as Russia, China and South Africa.  Given Trump's unusual presidential persona and style, some will even claim this applies to the US.  But in reality, the majority of entrenched interests in the US including the media, the legal community, the Democrats and their donors and proxies, the unions and government bureaucracies and others have conjoined to thwart the new president in pursuing most of the agenda he was democratically elected to implement.  So freedom still reigns in the US and other mature democracies and we celebrate this.

0,"Another option would for each state to require that its electoral votes would go proportionally to the popular vote in that state so that multiple candidates could win at least some of a state's electoral votes.  That would get rid of the winner-takes-all nonsense and shift the campaigns away from focusing entirely on a tiny handful of 'battleground' states to having to focus on all states.  Right now a conservative never bothers to campaign in California because there's zero chance of them winning those 55 votes.  But in the proportional system, Trump would have taken about 18 of those votes due to his 32% of the popular vote there.  Conversely, Clinton would have taken 16 of Texas' 36 votes due to her 43% of the vote there.  In this way, every state would be a battleground state and the candidates would be motivated to campaign nationwide rather than just in a half dozen states.  Heck, maybe we'd even see a presidential candidate visit Alaska! (Clinton would have taken 1 of our 3)

As for the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia, it will continue of course. The new FBI Director could influence it to some degree, but doing so would be the makings of a political maelstrom. Many other security agencies are involved in that investigation, Trump can't control them all, and if it exists any damaging information will come out anyway. Then, for attempting to subvert the course of justice, Trump would be vulnerable to impeachment.

0,"Since you ask, Kevin, here's the view of a conservative who thinks well of your shtick on Dragons Den and its US counterpart and of your investment acumen and success.  - You are not Donald Trump (who is worth 25 times or more what you are worth and has much more extensive, diverse, large scale business experience than you).  - Even if you were Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau is not tired out, burned out, brittle Hillary Clinton trying for a 3rd consecutive Democratic term..  - And even if you were Trump and Trudeau were Clinton, Canada does not have the same political culture as the US.  - Canadians are not be impressed you spend most of your time out of the country making money and none of your time bothering to learn our other official language.  - There are several more qualified candidates for the CPC leadership who are not carpetbaggers in the party or in the country.  They have earned consideration.  You have not.  - Why they even know that Parliament Hill is not Capital Hill.

0,"I think your belief that Trump, although he is a fascist and aspires to govern as a 'strong man'/dictator, would not be able to do that is based on your understanding of and respect for the structure of our government and the system of 'checks and balances' that is built into it.  I think you are probably right; our system has proved durable.  On the other hand, the systemd depends on the integrity and goodwill of office holder who, especially in times of crisis, subordinate partisan concerns for the good of the country.  The Watergate crisis resolved in the peaceful transition of power precisely because of the integrity and courage of the Republicans in Congress at the time.  That was then; this is now: I'm not sure how or whether the current Republicans would act to restrain the impulses of a very reckless, impulsive man.  Sadly, I agree with you about the tremendous damage that has already been done.

The proposed legislation is a good next step. We need hard data for good unbiased public policies. The goal is equal protection under the law for all of us. As a nation, we have never even been close to that goal. You would think the election of Trump would be enough proof of racial bias in government. His supporters made no secret of their white racism. I would not be surprised if Trump pardons Dylan Roof. I'm sure his supporters won't mind at all.

0,"You are probably right about Trump not being a conservative.  What republican truly is?  It is sad that one has to go back over 50 years to find a republican president who actually balanced the federal budget.  Today, republicans feel deficits don't matter when they are in charge.  But time will tell how the Donald will act.  I suspect he will follow GW's example and soon lead us into a war to boost his  approval ratings.  While the Donald probably got a boost from his speech last night, it won't last as he appears incapable of doing anything constructive.   Where are the jobs Donald?  Why is Hillary still free? Still,  I love the Donald.  He is so entertaining.   But now he has to deliver.

It wasn't, I doubt, meant to allow the smaller States to bully the larger, more-populated ones by giving the EC votes in the smaller ones up to eight times the weight of those from larger ones.  Even more 'clout' when you consider the EC votes are on a 'winner-take-all' system, which can evaporate ALL of the votes actually cast by up to 4.999% of the population and give ALL EC votes to the winning candidate who only got, say .01% more votes like say, Michigan, where Trump won only by 11,837 votes.  If the EC voted to give 49% of their votes to the 'loser' and 51% of their votes to the winner, then I'd respect it more. As it is, is simply 'disappears' a substantial number of votes that represent how """"the people"""" actually voted in all 50 States in the """"federation"""".

Consider what must be at stake if their intent is to propagandize Americans into believing the Russians hacked their election.  The election must therefore be invalidated, no?  So Congress must stop what it's doing, beginning with stopping progress on all the Trump-era reforms, and fix this major big huge problem, control the riots, and prevent the dollar from being devalued in domestic markets and sold off in world financial markets.

He won, and to Republicans, that's the only thing that matters. The means (allowing lies to stand unchallenged) justified the end, and the next end is for Republicans to maintain power by any means necessary so they can dismantle Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and reduce taxes on corporations and the 1% to nothing. And they will succeed, despite MSW's ardent policing efforts because half the country, those who will most likely be hurt by such policies, won't even notice because they'll be too busy being brainwashed by Fox News' attempts to blame everything on some Democrat, probably Bernie Sanders, or maybe Obama.

0,"Now, I want to get into some observations as a parent. My son attends a school where Muslims are religiously accommodated. My son is learning there are 2 rules at school. 1 for the Muslims and one for the dhimmis.  Example: My son has to sit out because he forgets his gym clothes. The Muslim girls are never asked to change out of their long dresses. The Muslim girls are always asked to be goalies because their dress helps block more of the net.  My son can't wear a baseball hat in school but the Muslims can wear a hijab? Why? If not wearing hats is a condition for good teaching, then the rule should apply to all! Why punish my son for his fervour for sports? My son learns his values are left at the door.  My son was sick for 1/2 a day and did not eat breakfast. The Muslims in the class only have to do half the gym because of fasting for Ramadan. My son asks to only do half the gym activity and he gets sent to the office. What has he learned? Islam trumps all. Very Shariahfied.

The man is a demagogue, a classic narcissist, who may literally see himself as a saviour to the nation and the world.  His gods are money and himself. But now he may very well become just as in love with power as with money.  Very frightening.  One could hope that he will decide to become the public face of America - basking in the limelight at dinners with the leaders of the world, the limos and parades, being in the world's spotlight, but tire of the real business of government.  He has little grasp of policy and apparently cannot focus. Perhaps then he will turn that part of the job over to Pence (I don't like Pence either, but while being an extremist, he does appear to be sane.  Let us pray it's not Bannon or the son-in-law) while he and his lovely wife preen before the cameras at State dinners and visits to world capitals.

0,"Budgets are more than a tool to plan and allocate funds.  Budgets also reveal morals and priorities of the  """"Statesmen, women""""  who campaigned for our votes, almost all have promised to help the poor and made claims that they care about those Americans who are struggling.  Budgets show who and what is most important to them and validates that fact that many Americans vote against their financial best interest and that of their families.  It should mystify every American that almost all Republican politicians deny climate change is real,  man made and spending money on reduction of carbon footprints is a waste of money  Trump has already spend 18 million in 5 weeks on his weekend golf trips to Florida.  Trump slammed Obama for a trip to Hawaii. Obama spent an average of 12 million a year on getaways.  AmeriCorps, Meals on wheels, and climate change are said to be a waste of money?  Investigating spontanetweets  that make wild claims are a value?  The Truth used to be important.

0,"There are two problems causing this-- FIRST- what the Trump folks have been doing is to sell the plan to the rich first-- all that they made clear so far are huge rate cuts for the wealthy and for US corporations as well as special cut to a 25% rate made for small businesses that operate like S corporations, LLC's or other """"pass through"""" entities, but only for """"small"""" businesses earning $250,,000 to $500.000, and SECOND-- Trump has not specified what breaks the middle class will get other than doubling the automatic personal deduction and a few minor changes but he has not said much yet and the details are almost zero as to who and how much the middle class benefits are. As one Republican put it-- he knows that an NFL player getting $1 million per year and kneeling for the National Anthem will get a $329,000 tax cut to spend, but so far does not know what middle class people in his district will get.

0,"Hey Kraz,  it sounds like you eschew verified journalism altogether.  I'd like to invite you to check out NPR or the Wall Street Journal.  Also, I believe Trump is a champion of censorship rather than freedom of speech, based on his track record of trying to block freedom of the press to try to benefit his cronies and hide his own constant,  embarrassing diarrhea of the mouth.  Saying that he is basing his opinion off of wanting to give people more freedom is laughable.  Thanks for the good chuckle your comment gave me.  Also, defending Nazis after so many Americans gave their lives to stop them and their hate filled ideology is shameful.  Any """"ideology"""" that leads you down that path needs to be re-evaluated.

No one really believes Trumps lies anymore than they believe Clinton's lies. I hope he rebuilds America. After all, he is a builder. I am certain that is what he will do.

We should do things for pollution, something the Paris Accord did not do, by excusing other countries from doing their share to reduce pollution. If Trump continues to do things against his Pre-President wisdom, which was spot on, he will not only break the hearts of millions of us that believe in him, but prove Bannon correct, he is tainted and surrounded by Libs that want to make this country horrible, not great. So Mr. President, go back to your Pre-President wisdom and place people around you that won't betray and change your goals and dreams to #MAGA. Please, our lives depend on it.

0,"As I pointed out in the comment you are responding to, the Bill Clinton fiasco with the accusations all seemed to boil down to he said, she said. The stories, accusations with regard to Trump are again, he said, she said. Some have been discredited and some have not, for both Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. In neither case is there any video or audio recordings or credible witness accounts. Someone being told about something is in the legal world known as hearsay, not first hand knowledge, and inadmissible in a court of law. There is no credible evidence that the Clinton accusers were paid for their stories other than by tabloids or Paula Jones, who settled with Bill Clinton for $850,000. The questions being raised about Bill's activities deal solely with Hillary's actions with regard to the accusers, not Bill's actions alone or at all. I am not even a party to those concerns, just straighten out those who, like you, say that it is Bill's actions that Trump is responding to.

If it can be conclusively proven that the Assad regime used chemical weapons, then Assad himself is guilty of a """"crime against humanity"""". The """"rule of law"""" means he should face these criminal charges.  Justice for the victims requires that the criminals who used chemical weapons must be charged.

This proceeding was an overall win for Trump especially when Comey had to admit he could not accuse Trump of obstruction, Russia had no impact on a single vote, Trump himself had not been under investigation, Comey himself leaked info, Comey lacked the courage to even voice his discomfort about a conversation and lacked the courage to release his own memo and was forced to admit that someone using the word """"hope"""" cannot be and has never been charged with anything.  You LIBs can cry and whine all you want but you blew this one big time.

(Although Barack Obama’s eight-year attempt to appear as if extending some sort of conciliatory olive branch to the Muslim world in the naïve hope that the bad guys would go away and stop bothering U.S. interests, wasn’t exactly subtle. Yeah, that worked.)  Fact is, a message to sell oneself to targeted voters in an election and a message for world consumption can and almost always are distinctly different things with distinctly different purposes.  That isn’t to say President Trump is a measured statesman. But toning down red-meat rhetoric in the road company isn’t a new thing.  Sorry if that comes as a surprise.

My sense in reading this board, and my experience in the offline world, is that is a strategy that polarizes the argument and that almost guarantees no progress in resolving the issues. It's a strategy, in other words, that so obviously guarantees that abortions will continue unabated and avoids discussions that might lead to policies to reduce them. To be fair, though, I understand the impulse. It was frustrating to me to watch Trump assume a """"pro-life"""" mantle as he ran for president, and even more frustrating to watch people in the """"pro-life"""" movement allow themselves to be duped. Now we've seen his budget and healthcare proposals: militantly anti-life, pro-sickness, pro-death and pro-abortion. Yet I've seen only one or two Trump voters admit they were duped.

With or without the courts decision the administration should have been establishing new vetting policies.  Yet, the court just gave them 120 day to do what they say they were going to do since March.  Why are new policies not ready now.

(Not to mention reduce the national debt which more than doubled under Obama's war on jobs to $20 trillion dollars) Disrespecting working class Americans and individual states is Obama and the democrats legacy.

Thus, if the PM and Liberal Government really enrage the majority of Canadians (little sign of that yet) and Trump and the GOP are a great success in governing (Do we really think that is likely?), then O'Leary might succeed in getting elected but his chances are blindingly slim.

Nixon said that journalists tend to look in the mirror rather than out the window. Great statement on biased news coverage repeated by Woodward.

0,"The investigation started in July and the reason he is in front of the committee now is to confirm what has been 'known' for several months.  If he was parsing statements before it is because the rules prohibit him from discussing (or confirming) any investigations that are ongoing.  One could argue that this is unprecedented that he is there talking about (and saying very little btw) about investigating the trump campaign team because its not to be done.  Its only happening because of the mess that has been wrought, in part by 45 and his merry men.  I assume since these agencies are linked to DOJ that it would come from AG (which would then be the Obama administration if it started last year) or if director think there is have enough reason, open one.  45 will forever have a shadow over him, whether or not he did something wrong.  Talk about the shoe being on the other foot, now he knows how HRC feels.  Any guesses how long it will take before he starts to attack Comey who he loved.

1,"Our tradition is that the president doesn't fire the director of the FBI, partly because investigation and indictment is separate from prosecution, which is the duty of the Atty Gen. On that note, it's time for all you people to stop flogging a dead horse, which Clinton is.  Clapper may have responsibility but it is delegated. Some to the CIA, some to the FBI, some to other agencies including, probably, the diplomatic corps. All those investigations happen apace, Clapper had no direct involvement, only oversight.  Trump said he fired Comey over his ruining of the Clinton Campaign, when in fact, Trump thanked Comey after Clinton's loss. Then three months later he uses the same loss to fire Comey. That's obviously a lie. Trump had been screaming at his TV over a week of Trump/Russia testimony, then he fired Comey. He fired Comey to stop the investigation. To believe otherwise is to be a total, self-deluded, wishful thinking chump. It's time to get real. You are a chump. Don't be.

0,"None of this matters.  Twitter has already said it has no intention of doing anything about Trump's tweets or retweets, so he, apparently, is free to be as inappropriate as he likes.

Accepting the presidency means putting up with attacks, political and personal,  like Obama did so graciously, without demeaning the office and embarrassing the country.

I find it interesting and hypocritical that the very same people who have gone out of their way to remove any and all reference to a supreme being in our institutions, holidays, and public places now, in desperation, ask electors to pray. You have used the Constitution, time after time, to challenge situations that you feel are against the liberal agenda, yet you now deride that same document for the way it has us elect our President.  Ironic, isn't it?  Stop whining, have a toddy, and actually recognize and accept reality.

It is a fact that Hillary worked with Debbie Wasserman Schultz of the DNC to limit debates with Bernie.  Even Bernie complained about the top loaded """"Superdelegates"""" forced to vote for Hillary.  CNN debate moderators submitted questions for Hillary to approve in her debate against Trump.  There were negative news reports on Trump and positive reports on Hillary by all networks, save one, that are documented statistically heavily favoring Hillary.   Trump was correct, the fix was in... for Hillary.  You owe the President an apology.  He is neither an imbecile nor a fraud.  He is the President of the United States.

This is mostly supported by the people as they feel that South Korea and lefty sympathizers in the West will never accept the numerous apologies and financial reparation Japan has openly given. They feel slapped in the face and so feel forced down a different road.

Their ever-changing & often bazaar demands (typically having a 24-36 hour shelf life) too often focus on domestic audience of the moment appeasement rather than on advancing negotiations.  In this context, Canada's best response is to present relevant US political, industry, labour & consumer interests with the facts about NAFTA's current beneficial impact (& on the enhancement of that impact which moderate updating would provide).

Clearly this is the trend continuing from the Obama recovery after the Bush-Republican Great Recession. Border crossings were way down under Obama -- he deported more undocumented people than Bush, and there was net out-migration as the economy improved south of the border. The stock market under Obama tripled and set records, clearly Trump is simply benefiting from the Obama trend.

(2) The DNC got hacked and did not provide information to the FBI; instead used a private company. (3) The DNC paid for foreign sourced opposition research in Fusion's Steele dossier and Clinton aids met with Ukrainian diplomats (4) Podesta and Clinton Foundation both have links to Russia; including a very dodgy uranium deal. (5) Only 4 of more than a dozen intelligence agencies attributed the hacking to Russia, providing no evidence outside private sector research that was questioned by cyber experts. Trump remains more accurate in being cautious about clear attribution.

Diversity of opinions can have true value in a democracy, but such diversity is largely absent from Canadian media, and most U.S. media outlets I am familiar with, these days. It is not just the often simplistic way in which the stories are covered, and the obvious bias of many so-called journalists, that are troubling, but also the fact that many important stories are either completely ignored or covered very briefly because they don't fit comfortably within the preferred media """"narrative"""", while other stories are overemphasized to a ridiculous extent because they confirm the biases of the journalists and editors in charge of covering them.

0,"As a Realist, I find this entire commentary troubling. China, being the worlds largest economy, possessing nuclear weapons and a sizable military, is, without dispute, a Great Power. As with all Great Powers in human history, it is only natural then, that China will exercise and seek to extend it's power over its sphere of influence, which, it is pretty clear, they intend to include the South China Sea therein. Of course, status quo powers will be determined to prevent China from extending its hegemonic reach, while China, a revisionist power, will seek to overturn the status quo in their favour. The choice, therefore, that we truly face, is whether we should try to accommodate China's rising influence within the international order (some may call this appeasement), or confront China militarily and/or economically in the hopes that we can defeat them and preserve the status quo. Either way, things are going to change. Sadly, Trump wont understand any of this.

0,"I agree. The cartoon would have made its point about the Bully in Chief without the dialog bubble. And the dialog bubble is part of a larger issue. I believe that Melania Trump would have been perfectly happy to remain a New York City socialite, but her husband had other ideas. I don't think she wants to be where she is, but is trying to make the best of it. Most spouses of politicians know what they are getting into, and probably have campaigned right alongside. Melania Trump is a reluctant First Lady. It's one thing if someone hands her a speech with plagiarisms in it (blame the speechwriters, instead). But to attack her for speaking with an accent is stupid. Likewise, attacking her for staying in NYC for six months while Barron completed a school year. I could easily see many parents doing that when their spouse gets a new job in a different city. But then, most spouses don't carry a 65% nationwide disapproval rating on their shoulders. I think we should leave Melania Trump alone.

0,"This author points to one of the reasons Trump won election: the lack of a unified opposition to offset a hardcore 35-40% who would support him, no matter what he said or did. While post-election commentary seems to assume that Trump will self-destruct or his hardcore group will be overcome by voters disgusted by this administration's performance, it seems equally possible, based on experience, that he will somehow manage to divide and conquer his way to re-election. The idea that our political candidates will resist the temptation to step into the void and will unite behind any single candidate -- well, it could happen, but I don't see a movement attaining critical mass any time soon. Donna Brazile, whatever her motives, may have opened a conversation the Democrats have needed, but have been reluctant to have in the post-Obama/Clinton era.

He even sent Ivanka to see the property and she did a Youtube video on it. He may have cut a deal on this one. What the Russian oligarchs and gangsters (as well as corrupt state operators) have done for years is they lure you into a deal, then they add things that are """"slightly"""" illegal instead of the one originally named. Pretty soon it is money laundering and too late to pull out. Then they blackmail you with the next deal. Or they bail you out like they did when one of the hotel deals Trump did was sued by the investors-- the VB bank run by Putin bailed out Trump by settling and paying off the lawsuit (Trump and the bank settle out in the future).

0,"President Trump has an opportunity to make the US  health care system and the social assistance program the world's best. All he need do is cancel all health legislation and legislate a Guaranteed National Income for the poor.  The US has the best medical system in the world. It has been working with Medicaid and Medicare and been accused of having private sector health care, with high cost. However the two government programs are the largest component of cost. Thus government programs not the private sector are responsible for the high cost of US health care.  With that exposed, the private sector can be looked at with fresh eyes. It provides virtually all our needs and wants, at reasonable cost (otherwise we would not buy the goods we do.) So we could expect  the same performance from the providers of health services.  Canada could benefit similarly by cancelling the Canada Health Act and legislate a Guaranteed National Income for the poor. Canadians could take care of themselves.

My prediction would be that a US Court judge (or Supreme Court) would likely rule against Trump. The establishment of religion clause of the US Constitution has been widely interpreted as providing a muscular freedom of religion, and a requirement for hands-off from government in he area of religious favouratism. I predict that Trump does not have a leg to stand on, legally, with that part of his proposal on refugees.""""  Ah, but perhaps you dismiss the above as the mere ramblings of dementia?

The opposite short strategy might also work.  A good word from Trump might be the kiss of death.  Certainly it won't help international branding of a company.

0,"Personally I hope China cracks down on its blatant loss of foreign reserves.  Much of that money flowing here and inflating our RE prices way beyond what Canadians can afford is ill begotten and is being laundered.  Just read the newspaper from San Fran where at least the FBI cares about these issues.  The law in China is that individuals are only able to export $50K  and yet we have  individuals purchasing million dollar homes by using friends and families as mules to ship additional packets of $50K.  That is illegal so I'd say extract the same amount from family back home until they repatriate those funds.  Once Trump gets in power and starts a trade war with China this will be all mute anyways because the Chinese will rapidly devalue the yuan in order to make foreign purchases unaffordable.  It can't happen too soon.

Russia was warned in advance of the cruise missile attack.  Since Russia apparently controls POTUS, it has felt free since January to: in violation of a treaty, deploy nuclear armed short range missiles aimed at Europe, increase its military operations in Ukraine (but Trump claims they're not there), increase its operations and influence in the Balkans, accelerate construction of a new spy base in Nicaragua, effectively take over the government of Syria, and this is all because Trump can't say a bad word about Russia or Putin; his silence speaks volumes about where his allegiances lie.
