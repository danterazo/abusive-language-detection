0,"Well, what do you expect. The modern workplace is a cesspool of toxicity. The reality is we spend the majority of work waking hours in an environment where people are dishonest and the only way you cope with it to maintain your sanity is to build a thick skin and a level of indifference to what happens to the workplace and co-workers. You can't expect humans to exist in that sort of environment for 40 years and get out of it without any sort of illness (be it mental, physical or somethings else).  Maybe they should adjust the MBA curriculum and train management on how to build and implement healthy workplaces.

0,"The conception of Catholism the msw presents here is one that pegs pride in country as racist, respect for personal and public property and the rule of law as racism, respect for nationalism as red-flag racist, respect for capitalism as egregiously anti-Christian,  respect for Christian norms of family as pure hatred-of-the-Other, respect for culture and American civics as hopelessly backward.  That is what msw is trying to sell you as """"the real Catholicism.""""   Voters in this country knew better.   They do not want to be hyper-liberal.   And, they never, ever, will.

0,"Aren't property taxes a sustainable funding model?  As far as I can tell, the city hasn't made its full plan public, so it is hard to know the trade-offs.  Many of the other facilities managed by DES have restricted public access.  My worry is that Thomas Square plan will trade public access for the chance to generate revenue from a source other than property taxes.  As a property owner and taxpayer, I'd rather keep Thomas Square fully accessible, even if it means paying more property tax.  Best yet would be for the city to keep up Thomas Square within the current budget, but the run-down shape of the park suggests this isn't possible, for whatever reason.

PAcatholic: There are still, according to the National Catholic Educational Association,  2 million children in US Catholic schools (primary and secondary) and nearly 3 million in such schools -- if one includes Catholic universities and colleges. Some Catholic secondary schools in the Washington, D.C., Boston, New York and Chicago area, for example, do very well, with their graduates getting into excellent colleges and universities. Jesuit Nativity schools also do wonders for under-privileged students in the inner cities. So not """"almost all"""" Catholic schools have been closed, as it were. Many, many are thriving.

0,"Ambrose99: I believe Otto von Bismarck noted the strategic implications arising from the fact that the U.S. and Britain share a common language in order to warn Germans against being militarily and territorially  ambitious to an extent they would come into conflict with Britain, which he felt would no doubt be aided by America's growing demographic, economic and  - in the late 19th century - potential military might. Two world wars might have been avoided had Germans heeded the advice of their Iron Chancellor. The importance of ties linking wealthy and important nations that share a common language, legal system and an interconnected history shouldn't be underestimated.

All factors that fail to be explained either by you or by the EIS for that matter. So now lets talk about what you omitted in your counter to me - Vehicle Hours Traveled. That is the real factor of measurement that people today are really looking at. According to the same report: """"<vehicle hours driven> will experience the greatest decrease: 18 percent. This reflects the fact that even moderate decreases in traffic volumes under congested conditions can result in relatively large decrees in travel delay."""" Again, stop telling half the story,

Deciding that was a evil thing, not a good thing, is not an unreasonable conclusion to arrive at.  That sort of 18th century world view is one of the reasons that the secular majority of Canadians have concluded that Religion causes more harm than good.  The irony of sending children to a school run by folks who set out to force them to believe in an imaginary supernatural being is huge.  It is unreasonable for someone with a modern education to believe in in supernatural being and powers. Unfortunately there is still much work to be done in that regard.

It's ironic that in a culture so focused on private property, cats can trespass freely and homeowners have no recourse. When I return home from work each day, looking forward to the peace of my house and to working in my garden, the first thing I encounter is the smell of cat poop from my neighbors cats. I would much rather have birds than cats in my yard, but there's nothing I can do. I feel that my neighbors, who are largely excellent dog owners, and would not let their dogs in my yard, are incapable of comprehending the harm they do through their cats. I agree with the comments that dogs are more dangerous and often unleashed in unsafe ways. Most pet owners in my view, including myself could be more conscientious, but the cat issue is a big one that needs to be addressed. I would love to be able to enjoy my yard without cats, but I have no hope for it in my lifetime..

I prefer the French pronunciation of 'Bucket' to 'Bouquet', and then it seems wiser somehow. Happy New Year.

0,""""" It isn’t a stretch to think his [Trump's] rhetoric may have resulted in the mass murder of Muslims in Quebec City. """"  Actually, that is a stretch, or more precisely, a shortcut.  Many of us are visually based learners, and the link between danger and visual clues is one such shortcut that hits the front of our minds instantly, regardless of our ethnicity or religion, all over the globe.  This is the root of racism, and it is hard-wired in virtually all of us.  Some of us, like the writer, have minds wired for ideological confrontation, and produce sentences like the one quoted above.  That response springs from the same type of mental shortcuts that produce racism, and it is apparently just as invisible to the ideologue as prejudice is to the racist.  But she's right. in the same way that Harvey Milk was right.  We need to get to know each other.  That's what re-routes our thought processes to override these shortcuts, and may produce a more tolerant world.

Heretics in every age have been saying that.   """"Who cares what the bishops think? We are going to do it our way!"""" Go do it your way. Go found another Protestant Church and show the bishops how you think it should be done.  No one threatens someone with eternal damnation for opposing the social teaching of the Church?  That is news to me.  Jesus seemed pretty clear that those who do not love and care for the poor are eternally doomed.  Ever hear of the rich man and Lazarus?

An honest reply would have been: At the University of Alaska we actually change out our faculty more frequently than our light bulbs. The low-morale of (remaining) staff, (remaining)students and (remaining) faculty is not driven by budget cuts or change, but by safety issues on campus and a lack of logic and transparency in the SP process. If SP is about money then a cost benefit analysis should be demonstrated for every decision like athletics ($16 million what?). If SP is about making a great University then faculty, staff, and students should be allowed to make recommendations when serving on SP committees, not simply choose from pre-selected options. We all want to make UA massively great again, but want to be part of the tremendous effort.  and 50% increase in student enrollment in 7 years? HA

Why is a long trip a problem if you no longer die at 80?

If you can live to 500, would you """"marry for life"""" - an institution that made sense when many lived only long enough to procreate and a bit more.

Had all this stuff been legal under a registered addict program for the last generation, dangerous drug users would now be a significant number, but greatly reduced as a social problem because they have easy access to what they want.

However, in order to ensure that Protestant innovations deep not creep into the Mass which was happening in Europe: e.g. Archbishop Von Wied was introducing liturgical changes in Cologne written for him by the reformer, Martin Bucer. Any rites less than 200yo were suppressed so that no novelty elements could be introduced. Policing a host of different rites and uses to keep them free of doctrinal error would have been difficult. Other rites and uses such as those of Milan, Toledo, the Dominicans and Carthusians continued. St Pius V's action, far from being """"an historical anomaly"""" was designed to save Christendom from fragmentation.

0,"The Short Story About 12,000 years ago, the valleys of western Montana lay beneath a lake nearly 2,000 feet deep. Glacial Lake Missoula formed as the Cordilleran Ice Sheet dammed the Clark Fork River just as it entered Idaho. The rising water behind the glacial dam weakened it until water burst through in a catastrophic flood that raced across Idaho, Oregon, and Washington toward the Pacific Ocean. Thundering waves and chunks of ice tore away soils and mountainsides, deposited giant ripple marks, created the scablands of eastern Washington and carved the Columbia River Gorge. Over the course of centuries, Glacial Lake Missoula filled and emptied in repeated cycles, leaving its story embedded in the land. Flood Facts:  The ice dam was over 2000 feet tall.  Glacial Lake Missoula was as big as Lakes Erie and Ontario combined.  The flood waters ran with the force equal to 60 Amazon Rivers.  http://www.glaciallakemissoula.org

Look at the videos, including especially the one taken in the truck.  Listen to the audio of Finicum's statements.  Visit those right-wing sites which posted outrageous claims regarding """"hundreds of shots"""" fired at the truck and the """"murder"""" of Finicum and decide which version seems credible...the right-wing extremist's or the government's version, based on the videos and the investigation.  Getting into a grand argument with those attacking the officers is, to me, a wasted effort.

I think that most reasonable people do realize that there are some false allegations of rape and sex abuse.   And that there have indeed been some infamous cases where prosecutors have been documented as having engaged in witch hunts.  But to Outsider77, EVERYONE accused of these heinous crimes is innocent.   Judging from his long history of comments, one must assume that he believes that these heinous crimes never, ever happen.

Is it normal in the business world to just trust companies to pay what is right, even when we are dealing with billions of dollars and a huge incentive to lie? Perhaps if oil companies would pay the $488 million owed from 2 years of audits, the state could finish the audits and collect the billions we are owed...then it would seem as if there was some accountability and this might build trust. Currently no one trust these opinion pieces by the oil industry because it is based on nothing but you expecting us to trust you.  You all expect us to trust you when we can see the truth with our own eyes.  Some Alaskans actually trusted you with SB21 lies about production increases and more jobs.

0,"Respectfully EIDOLON, I stayed up and watched the president as he spoke before APEC in Vietnam. Had to go to a unusual media outlet that showed him speaking in it's entirety of just over 30 minutes. For the first time, I saw a president stand up and powerfully place America before the nations present, in a very powerful and meaningful presentation. It was a far cry from Mr. Obama's World Apology Tour! Mainstream televised didn't show the speech, thus I was forced to go to an extremely right wing cable station, to watch and see the speech itself uninterrupted, in it's entirety. Because if I relied on the mainstream televised media in America, I might have to read the speech somewhere else, versus seeing it live and how it was received by the nations present. Did you watch the speech if I might ask respectfully EIDOLON? Mr. Trump did a great job speaking to the sovereignty of nations, the equality of trade, and what America's path will be. If he lives up to it, even better!

It was installed during another State fiscal crisis back in the 1980s.

You will probably have to get through one winter where the Muni will doing a crap job of plowing the roads to try to convince the voters that the tax cap was a bad idea, but if you refuse to cave into their pressure, they'll get used to it and will learn how to streamline the budget so that the taxpayers don't get raped.

A longliner takes the same amount of time to pull a mile of gear - they get 1 fish per hook on the best trips.  The fish density of pots is far greater given the amount of effort. Pots also do not have a sea mammal impact - at all. Longline cod has a far higher carbon footprint and a higher interaction with bycatch and sea mammals. We have had observers and federally reported statistics which support my comment since the 1990s. A very robust collection of data indeed and the evidence behind my comment is only growing with each season.  And really - change that photo.

Young people attend until they go to University or leave home, it is a very expensive area for anyone starting out in marriage.   The decline happened because more people got divorced, women wanted to decide on whether or not they use birth control, people in their 30s and 40s saw their parents rejected by the church and lost faith, because of the abuse scandals or where brought up by people that were badly hurt by the church, and want nothing to do with it..  I have family who left because they supported a son and brother who is gay, they accept him, not church teaching and they hated their Catholic Schools.

Free healthcare comes with a cost (50% of your Provincial tax).  Gov't has demanded net 0% increase to hospitals' (exception administration) budget over the last few years. To achieve this (administrators' bonuses), they downsize HR, reduce ORs, hire RPNs and not RNs, close beds, limit investigations, hire PT thus no benefits, sick leave, etc (and no loyalty).  This created the dreaded longer surgical wait times which makes the gov't look bad. Thanks Dr. Obvious.  Now the gov't wants hospitals to increase efficiency.........do more with the same amt;  e.g., more surgeries. Problem is, healthcare professionals are tired of the slander and just want to go home. Their drive has been eroded & their profession crushed just like the gov't wanted.  Only patients can force the gov't to listen & revitalize healthcare with everyones input

In life there are natural, logical, and societal consequences. Maybe Socialism doesn't """"get it"""" because he can't feel empathy for the victim or the family and friends of the victim.

When a President selects an ambassador he makes sure he selects one with great knowledge and talent in countries he considers important. But he selects his campaign supporters for countries where he just doesn't care. So if one gets a career, talented ambassador, one knows that that country is important.  Now, Ben Carson's selection says Trump just doesn't care to select someone with knowledge of the complicated life at HUD, in fact, to me, this signals that Trump will be doing what he can to pull a """"Reagan"""", use tax cuts to the rich to impoverish the low income seniors and disabled people who depend on HUD housing. So he has selected a woman to help destroy the Department of Public Education, and a black man to help destroy HUD. Diversity. Time will tell if I am being too disrespectful and fearful.

0,"At the same time, if we don't stand up against actual oppression in our churches, as the Gospel tells us to do, including the abuse and oppression of women called to same exact ordination as men, then we become the reason the oppression continues, along with all the other ills which have stemmed globally based on that example of discrimination, such as global poverty, terrorism, slavery, violence.  As our readings today from the Gospel of Luke state clearly - He who dies does not gather with me scatters.  Jesus is truth and justice in the flesh.  One cannot refuse to stand against injustice and claim to be standing authentically for Christ or the Truth or the Gospels.  It is not righteous to ignore injustice against any group of people merely to avoid conflict.  Our leaders do this often and demand we keep silent in the face of sexism.  This is not unity - it is abuse and oppression.

Seems that the more 'smells and bells'  a seminarian or priest is the less concerned about the body of christ assembled together in worship is he. - Happily, the current english translation of the 3rd typical edition of the missal from rome (the JPII missal) which memorializes by faulty translation and incipiently questionable theology the roles of the cleric over and above that of the body of christ assembled together is steadily approaching suppression. - BTW, the bishops of the US need to educate parish staff that the 'donation' for a mass request is just that, and that the donation is legitimate even if the 'donation' is zero.

Meanwhile, her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Clinton, by advocating for women, children and families, and especially for health care, has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Trump ever has or ever will.  Back to Rummel: While there is no evidence that Trump cares about abortion except for whatever political advantage can be derived from opposing it, the evidence is overwhelming that he is a racist and a fascist.

And if a relationship like this did happen, one of the persons involved had to transfer to another department/division/branch etc, based on the position of the supervisor. If no transfer position was available, one of the involved would have to voluntarily resign their position. If they chose not to resign, one or both were released from their duties. The reasons for this type of policy are many, including the morale of co-workers, the implication of favoritism, etc etc. - everything that's currently happening with Parent and her partner.

The Commandant of Treblinka, Kurt Stangl,  also admitted that mass murder by gas took place in Treblinka. His excuse was that he was only following orders.  Whats your excuse?

Alaska legislators pad their salaries by choosing to get """"reimbursed"""" for lodging and food at the federal per diem rate-regardless of expenses- rather than at the state per diem rate used by the Governor and other state employees.  http://www.adn.com/sites/default/files/2015%20Legislative%20Travel%20Report.pdf  Legislators got about $235/day, or $7,000 per month, in 2015 for lodging and food- even if their lodging costs in Juneau were $950 and $750, as were Reps. Reinhold and Vasquez.  And the legislative beat goes on. https://youtu.be/umrp1tIBY8Q

0,"You have made three very interesting points, Silverhorn.  One is that we are all in a demographic trap regarding a shortage of young people to support the old.  The US has a total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.87, almost the same as Norway or Britain.  Japan's is 1.41, which means their population is plummeting, and they are averse to migrant labor.  They should allow immigration, but """"racial purity"""" matters to them.  China's TFR is 1.6 according to the CIA, but who really knows?  Their incredible demographic turmoil may run short of labor.  Northern and Central Africa have TFR's in the 4-6 range, as do Arab countries.  The Gaza Strip is over 4, meaning their population will double every generation.  How can they sustain that?  A steady-state economy? That's what the West and Japan have now.  But there is much work to be done.  Direct stimulus in the form of infrastructure jobs would really give a boost, and my portfolio would grow; but Congress doesn't want to fund it. toobadsosadi'mmad

0,"That decision you mention let the DACA rule stand and dealt only with DAPA-- a very different program with a much larger scope. That decision was appealed to the SCOTUS which was deadlocked and let the decision stand, leaving DACA in place with a status of not being unconstitutional.  So until Trump's order, DACA is legal and constitutional and the participants who qualified have limited documented rights to be in  the US. The question now is can the presdident's action cancel out the rights of DACA participants? Has he followed Federal law on changes in policy (Administrative Procedures Act), has he provided due process and equal protection before he takes away the rights given DACA through Federal action and a contract of allowing residence in exchange for personal information from the participants.

0,"An interesting article in relation to the family political affiliations that extend beyond the original WW2 generation in NK, SK, and Japan. The article also touches upon some of the deep rooted fears NK and China have of Japan being involved in this conflict, as Japan was never significantly defeated on the battlefield in China and Korea from 1932 to 1945.  It was also interesting to note the first Kim being involved in the Chinese communist party- a guerrilla movement that sat back in WW2 and left most of the fighting against the Japanese to the Kuomintang nationalists, which left it significantly weakened for the communists to take over after the war.  A strategy repeated by NK in 1950. They invaded the south well organized and armed, engaged in mass murder in Seoul, and had the SK forces surrounded on land and against the sea.  It was a lightening strike and utterly foiled by the Americans under General MacArthur at the Battle of Inchon.  NK citizenry remains the only victim.

The situation is equally applicable to some regions of Canada.  In PR as in Canada, we now rely on """"just in time"""" delivery systems to provide us with just about everything including food and fuel. As the Brits learned during their 2000 fuel emergency, nothing moves without fuel: essential personnel can't get to work, hospitals run out of meds, supermarkets can't be resupplied.  In hurricane-prone regions like PR, local government agencies should do what most agencies did decades ago: maintain enough fuel storage to provide essential services for a couple of weeks. Diesel is essential to run trucks & buses, generators and heavy equipment that can clear debris. Gasoline will run chainsaws, small generators and service vehicles.

The more cops there are, the more criminal charges there will be. Thus, the number of judges, court staff, prosecutors and defence lawyers needs to be in proportion to the number of cops; any time the number of cops is increased, the number of judges, etc. needs to increase accordingly. The more judges there are, the more sentences will be pronounced. Thus, the more judges there are, the more prisons, prison guards, probation officers, parole officers, etc. there need to be.  One of the big problems is that governments react to perceived crime problems by increasing the number of cops without allowing for a corresponding increase """"downstream"""".

You are correct that the law will not be enforced as a stand alone charge.  For example, if the idiot who recently shot up the 7-11 on campus was found to have received the gun illegally, those charges would more than likely be filed on both parties to the transaction. That is much different than investigating an illegal transfer based on a tip, when no other crime was committed.

The firm likely took the case on contingency. Firms like this don't take cases like this on contingency unless their chance of a settlement or court award is very high.  The goal of this lawsuit is only known by the plaintiff, who obviously had no ties to the Church. SNAP has long been in the process of discrediting themselves. In case you have not noticed, there are other organizations that support survivors, and these organizations were formed by former SNAP malcontents. So your claim that SNAP is """"the one"""" is just plain false.

Go back and look who was the technical majority when SB21 was passed. It was a Democratically-led caucus because, for reasons I've never quite grasped, Republicans were in the majority, but they felt they needed to caucus with the Democrats and put them in charge. Go take a look.  This is not me saying the Republicans are better than the Democrats, but that BOTH major parties are unethical thieves.

For invading countries based on a lie?  American soldiers did everything from urinating on the graves of fallen Taliban to, using drones to kill ordinary citizens extra judicially, to pulling the bullets out of the bodies of Afghan women to hide the fact from the authorities, to mowing down journalists with helicopter gunships.  The USA cannot have it both ways - they cannot bully their allies into obeying the law without following those same laws. This is why the US has lost its leadership in the world.

If they enter Canada illegally, they are free in a matter of hours with a suite of government services and get a minimum monthly payment + additional benefits for dependants. The surprising thing is, why aren't more illegal migrants crossing? They have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain, including citizenship. If they stay in the US, they will likely be deported. It's only going to get worse as word gets out. US officials should put notices in the local papers in border towns and Spanish radio stations about Canada's system.

In other words, I think it necessary to do both in response to our fiscal problems. That said, I support Gov Walker's veto of 1/2 the PFD funding simply because it was essential that the governor do everything within his power to stabilize our finances. In any case, the legislature left him with no choice.  I also support Sen Wielechowski for following his conscience adhering to his principles despite the political blowback. Again, it would have been much preferable to address our fiscal imbalance through a combination of additional revenues, use of some PF earning and adjusting oil taxes. But as usual blocking the to road to fiscal stability is the rigid ideology of the republican majority.  Not rooting for or against either side here so I'll give kudos to both Wielechowski and Walker after the legislature left both men with few options.

First, it is interesting to note that Pry refuses to tell you what is """"doctorate"""" is actually in and where he obtained it from.  That refusal should tell you all you need to know.  Second, it is also important to note that Pry makes mega-bucks from the EMP scare.   Follow the money.  The """"EMP Commission"""" also did not include any members with actual expertise in this issue.  Where are the AF Sergeants who actually maintain the E-4B?   THEY know the truth.  Now, lets get down to basic physics.  THE RANGE OF AN EMP IS NOT LARGER THAN THE RADIUS OF THE EXPLOSION.  For an EMP to effect the entire US would either require a bomb 100,000 times larger than the largest nuclear device ever detonated, or require 10,000 simultaneous nuclear detonations across the US.  In that case, an EMP would be the least of our problems.  Spend more time reading Jacskon's """"Classical Electrodynamics"""" and talk to the actual experts.

0,"The new tax bill doesn't help most of the people I know. It eliminates tax credits that teachers take to buy supplies or get continuing education credit. For real estate investors, it now taxes the rent earned at the self-employed federal rate of 15.3%, which will further raise rents. If you are trying to invest in real estate for the future (since you do not trust stocks), you can only deduct up to $500,000 of mortgages, which again, will raise rent. If you are sick and need expensive medication or on cancer treatment, you cannot deduct those expenses. If you are a student, you can no longer deduct your student loan interest. If you are a married family with more than one child, the previous deductions per child exceed the new deductions by several thousand dollars per child. You cannot deduct expenses for taking care of an elderly family member. The reason why the bill does not require more than 51 positive votes is because it only adds $1.5 TRILLION to our deficit. Jeez!

Let's not fail to mention the not unimportant impediment the constitution poses where these matters are concerned, which must surely be inconvenient to Trudeau, who's prone to wrap himself in the sanctity of that document when it serves him to do so. There is no route for aboriginal independence under the current version of the constitution, which subsumes the Proclamation of 1763, whereby Crown sovereignty is asserted across all Canadian lands. And the Supreme Court recently threw cold water on the fantasy of an aboriginal veto over development. The UNDRIP is at best an aspirational instrument and the big concern should be that Trudeau is creating expectations that can't be met.

Of course she has an intimate knowledge of the threat of nuclear warfare. She is not saying a nuclear attack is imminent or likely, pressing means serious. As the US' most forward position in the Asia-Pacific, Hawaii lies within the crosshairs of North Korea, Russia, and China. So obviously the threat of nuclear attacks by these countries needs to be taken very seriously because of the disastrous potential of the consequences.  Disregarding the threat of North Korea shows a severe lack of knowledge in regard to foreign affairs.  Furthermore, Tulsi went on to say, setting that aside, the most pressing issue for Hawaii is the high cost of living. Read her full answer.

And it doesn't change when the torture is taken on by a patriot, albeit a sociopathic one.  The terrorist made his point perfectly. The USA is willing to kill innocent people in order to protect its interests overseas. So he too would kill innocent people to highlight that injustice.  Be you a person or a nation, killing innocents to achieve your purpose is immoral. It matters not whether you kill one or many. The immorality doesn't wax or wane with the body count. There's a cause and effect issue involved as well. By killing innocents abroad, the USA invited a retaliatory act. One for which it could extract no retribution.

0,"More Dough Morneau and the Liberals are lucky to have a growth council to provide cover for them to break still more of the cynical and irresponsible election promises they made in 2015.  This time, they will be able to say """"the growth council made us do it"""" when they break yet another in the increasingly lengthy list of rash promises they made to con the rubes and get elected but never expected to keep.  Of course, finance minister Morneau already knew a long time ago what the growth council's position would be regarding keeping the Harper policy of increasing the OAS eligibility age by a couple of years to keep the system solvent.  After all, Morneau while in the private sector about five years ago co-wrote a credible book in which he explained persuasively why the OAS eligibility age should be raised and why Canadian seniors are doing fairly well.  But this was before he became a Liberal politician which provides a license to play fast and loose with the truth and with promises.

In fact the Bt that is engineered into corn so that strong chemicals don't have to be used is an agent used commonly in organic farming and is in most food you have eaten all your life.  You might find actually doing objective research a little helpful.  Richard Nixon set foreign policy in 1973.  Kissinger was just an adviser.  Kissinger won the Nobel Prize.  Partisanship aside, he has actually done something.  Having worked in health care management I can tell you Sanders plan would be a disaster.  Medicare is barely functional.  An objective review of their bios shows that Clinton has a bias for action and accomplishment.  Only people who make an effort risk failing, or falling short.

This is what happened with the Tillamook fire, a similar event happened in West Virginia after loggers eradicated that state's old growth.

0,"I agree with you on the informal schism but short of reconciling this, I think a formal schism would allow people from both camps to practice their faiths more honestly and authentically. However, I don't think a schism will occur under Pope Francis unless it is the conservatives who split. But in essence they can't because the Bishop of Rome is the purported leader of the universal church. Perhaps PF's desire to be called the Bishop of Rome (as opposed to """"Pope"""") was a first step toward hierarchical decentralization, and this would open the door for bishops to guide their respective flocks according to the principles of sensus fidelium. This is all pure speculaltion of course, IMO it is more likely that successive popes will continue to confound matters by insisting that their vision for the church is tantamount to Divine Truth, thereby furthering the RCC down the path of ecclesial irrelevance. Perhaps Cyprian was right when he warned against elevating Rome as bishop of bishops in3AD.

0,"The state along with the local, corporate media has long looked at Arctic Refuge as an economic savior to the state’s periodic economic woes. Yet, in the past, the amount of oil in Arctic Refuge has been estimated to range from 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil up to over 11 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil.  This is an important distinction between what is economically recoverable as it takes in the economics and costs of oil development whereas technically recoverable oil does not.  In the past, estimated jobs created by development had been hyper inflated by then Senator Frank Murkowski which was deceptive in his attempt to push through development.  Furthermore, the 2,000 acre footprint was highly deceiving as this only counted the support structures that actually touch the tundra. It did not take into account the acreage for gravel roads, warehouses, pipelines above the tundra minus the support structures, living facilities, etc. To be continued:

To give physicians the same after-tax income through what he describes as the """"front-door"""" would cost Ontario taxpayers much more to gross them up for the high top-rate taxes!

When they were just arms length away,  I was grabbed and had a knife at my throat in about two seconds.  They only way I could have prevented this, if I had been armed with a handgun, would be to draw and display the weapon as they approached.  As I now understand the law, this could be considered a felony, armed assault, because until they acted, they did not overtly threaten me.    After that, I did obtain a concealed carry permit, which was difficult to get in Boston, and I carried  .25 Barretta in my front pocket.  I was never mugged again, but that probably had to do with the fact that I stayed out of parks, even in the daytime.  I always wondered how I would handle a similar situation, if it arose, and what the outcome would be.  These days, I do not own any firearms, but I live in a relatively crime-free rural area.

Anti-abortion at any stage of embryonic existence falsely portrayed as based on a government founded on judeo-christian heritage, Declaration of Independence, and Constitution.  Blatant lies to support failed attacks, including murder,  against the right of women to their own bodies.  The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were crafted, written, and signed by Theists, not all christian participants.  One more example of historical revisionism to falsely support an anti-human rights agenda.

There are two aims: 1) to discredit Trump election, 2) to begin war on expected Trump foreign policy of promoting peace instead of war. The CIA accusation is top secret, no one outside can see 'evidence'. Indeed, there is no need for evidence.  Of course without war, aggression, confrontation, the entire Deep State Machine - CIA, NSA, Pentagon, State - now controlled totally by Neo-cons, will crumble. The last president who dared to challenge the Deep State was JFK. He even canceled Pentagon plans to invade Cuba, start the Vietnam War. Threatened to break the CIA up. The Deep State took care of him permanently. The got their wars.  2017 is shaping up to be year of, yes, more American wars. But before they do more foreign wars they have to slug it out in the Beltway first.

0,"How about this: any foreign company buying residential property should be taxed at commercial rates (typically 2-3 times residential rates)?  Apparently many of the foreign buyers purchase through offshore shell companies.   But if you want to really want to put a major dent in real-estate speculation, apply it to all companies.  Also, even if foreign buyers are 5% of the market, think of the annual compounding effect and that many of these homes sit empty - it would be hard for supply to keep up with demand.

Very interesting. And then striking a police officer, in the face... again, you should expect no consequences from your actions. So showing a total disregard for authority and choosing to get into a physical confrontation with them by hitting them in the face, instead of simply doing what they asked, that is perfectly fine with you... expect no consequences and then blame them for it. I have seen a few cops shows where the criminals are shooting at the police and saying they are just defending themselves too.

0,"In China the rout for convicted fraudsters, or people found guilty of theft, to this very day, is to Execute the guilty person immediately, and having done so, then to go to the immediate family and present a demand for the payment of the bullet used to kill the relative. The Romans used to organize a public parade with the victims of the oppressor being paraded through the streets in chains, before they were executed. Whilst these are extreme examples of sentencing perhaps we should introduce a law which says that all the assets of the relatives of the guilty party  down to the third and fourth degree of consanguinity be divested of their property movable and immovable and intellectual property, wherever in the world that property exists. Make the guilty  work in the coal and gold mines  mines as slaves, until the day that they  come to the end of their natural lives. South Africa should through the he United Nations present a list of the Guilty as people of ill repute. Nuff said.

0,"The best approach to underpin Canadian incomes would be to reverse our cheap labour policy by massively cutting back immigration and the incredible TFW program.  A tightening of the labour market would lead to higher wages, productivity and job quality.   If part time $18 an hour jobs were going begging, a much higher percentage of our lower functioning populace would be drawn into it.   The result:  an engaged populace working closer to their potential with lower social support costs.  Everyone wins.  Except developers and cheap labour employers.

Most ridings in Ontario have a demographic that, while English-speaking, understand the need for a Prime Minister to speak and understand at least passable French and would not countenance a PM that didn't.  The fact that Harper could speak French made him acceptable to those Ontarians who think that it is a requirement that a PM speak French even if they themselves couldn't.  After all, there is a large population of English-only speakers in Ontario who send their kids to French immersion because they believe that knowing both languages will be a help to their children going forward.  Even if they cannot speak French, they expect the PM to be able to speak it.

I'll leave the decision to the individual buyer as to whether a fixed or variable rate suits them best. However, regardless of mortgage type, be fully aware that even a .25% difference in rate adds up to thousands of dollars over a five year mortgage term and tens of thousands of dollars over a twenty five year amortization. That is one hell of a price to pay for a 'fulsome conversation'. Making the argument that consultative services should be considered when shopping for a mortgage is an argument that only someone on a bank's payroll could make.

I do tell my wife where my final destination will be and I also carry a satellite tracker that reports my position every two minutes to a website.

Handling downturns is key. In early 2016, I bought a lot but should have bought more.  We sort of saw the 2008 – 2009 downturn coming but never expected a financial crisis. We noted the demise of two Bear Stearns “hedge funds” in Aug 2007 (likely toxic waste CDOs) but wondered why central banks were excited. Later in Aug, an Economist article noted that the interbank market had frozen up due to counterparty risk: nobody knew where the junk was. We rebalanced our “efficient market” portfolios toward cash and any incoming cash went into cash.  Come early 2009, I started buying but randomly. Picked up ADN, NPI, PPL and a mutual fund of junk bonds. On margin by midyear for the first time ever. It was scary.  My plan when the next big one comes is to cease spending dividends and reinvest.

0,"I would look at the long term benefits to the city and community. 20+ years from now, without improvements to the infrastructure, traffic will become much worst. This is what initially drove the need for the project. In principle, you either buy into that argument or you don't. If you do, rail was part of the solution.  When the project started, theoretically, there was a $1 benefit for every dollar spent. Now it will cost $1.5. If it stops at middle street, the benefit is like 20%. This is not a viable option. If the project is abandon, there is ZERO benefit. So the only real viable option is to somehow source the additional funds needed, maybe incrementally another $0.50 to get the original $1.00 benefit (or close.) If people can still see the ultimate need, this is the option. But there would be a political price to pay.

We have never achieved equal protection under the law for all our citizens and never intended to deliver that equality world wide. The average American has no idea of how much rape, robbery, torture and murder that they have benefited from. They don't want to know.

The bottom line of both courses is that it difficult, if not impossible, to effectively prepare for NBC warfare.  The NucWeps course, focused on how to achieve the desired results from nuclear weapons detonations.  For example, underwater detonations can be used to cause huge tsunamis, low-altitude detonations can be used to create massive radioactive contamination and high-altitude detonations can kill populations while causing """"limited"""" infrastructure damage.

While a U.S. passport may be used for both these purposes, it is a travel document. Most people seek a passport when planning a trip and only a relatively small proportion of the population holds a passport at any given time. 9  As a result, the preferred form of documentary identification in the United States is the drivers’ license. Drivers’ licenses are issued by the states, pursuant to a widely varying body of state-specific laws and regulations. Currently, twelve states and the District of Columbia allow illegal aliens to obtain a drivers’ license.  So, tell me why tightening down voter fraud when it may have handed our current Commander-in Chief his presidency?  Frankly, if he had anything at all to hide, he certainly would NOT be pursing this.

0,"Some boards have been very proactive about requiring teachers hired on their French credentials, to commit to French Immersion and/or Core French positions for varying amounts of time (up to 5 years I've seen). Other boards have no such requirement. Consequently, brand new teachers get hired for permanent French positions and then quickly move into English classrooms (not all of them of course, but it happens far more often than it should). The result is English classes staffed by very inexperienced teachers and French Immersion/Core French positions that cannot be filled. Meanwhile, English speaking teachers with years of experience and extra courses taken at their own expense, are passed over. Boards who want to offer quality French instruction need to have some new policies. For example, if you want the English classroom, you must compete with English qualified teachers who are not permanent, not get preferential opportunities based on your French that now you are not going to use.

0,"Thanks for your comment.  As per my post above, the uproar was about non-indigenous people attempting to write about indigenous people.  But suppose a non-indigenous writer decides to write a story with indigenous characters?  Is that permitted, or is that 'voice appropriation'?  Or do you have to look at the result and determine whether or not the writer has written something worthwhile? If it is this, okay there isn't much debate because you are judging the 'work' without having to resort to looking at 'who the author is'.  However an editor wrote an editorial suggesting 'white' writers 'stretch' (learn) themselves to write about 'what they don't know'. There was an immediate uproar that he was advocating 'voice appropriation' (i.e. 'whites' shouldn't be attempting to write about indigenous peoples  since they can never know what it is truly like) and he had to resign.  The meaning of this seems to be that 'White' writers shouldn't be writing about indigenous culture.  QED

If subjective motives are a determining factor, then a different President judged to have different motives might issue the exact same order and have the court approve it.

Again, imagine the insanity of identical laws or orders issued by two different people with those of one person ruled unconstitutional and the those of the other not based purely on perceived motives.

At the Filoli dig, the archaeologist described one poor sod who had a dental abscess that had eaten up into his mandible and reached his eye socket - probably a proximal cause of his death, after a long period of chronic pain (if not agony).

Worked with him on addressing the Hispanic needs/presence in our north Dallas parish - liturgy, school, sacraments, family religious training, etc. and setting up encounters so that anglo, long time parishioners understood and welcomed Hispanics.  Mark donated and financially supported my high school youngest to do a summer program via Dallas diocese in Honduras.  She learned about poverty, Spanish (she is now bi-lingual), and came back with a totally different outlook on poverty, culture, etc.  Mark currently supports significantly and powerfully local and state efforts via Interfaith organizations (IAF Texas) in El Paso, San Antonio, Austin, Valley, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, etc.  IAF Texas will be using Mark's pastoral with its institutions - in excess of 100 catholic parishes.  The TX Bishops are actively working in Austin now with special session of legislature and Democrats pushing back on SB4.

However, I strongly doubt that e.g. a devout Muslim would be willing to even consider the possibility that the recorded acts of Brahma actually happened. That's the problem with tales of acts of god. If you take the Abrahamic position that there is only one true god, then the vast majority of reports of divine action, being attributed to false gods, must be false, and if a vast majority are false, how can we tell if any are true?

And a plate would be the first thing a thief would remove (or steal from another bike to use on a stolen one), so I don't see registration as a deterrent to theft. Even when high-end bikes with unique serial numbers are registered, their recovery is given a low priority by law enforcement.

Obama led us to three new wars in the Middle East (Libya, Syria, and Yemen) paid for with trillions of new debt.   He has authorized Iran to have nuclear weapons in 15 years.  He has just initiated a US  Armored Brigade to be stationed in Poland across from Russia.  He has killed thousands of innocent civilians with drone strikes by both the military and the CIA in Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria with no prior oversight but that of himself.  Who told him to do all those things?  Why it was justified when Hillary and that particular Congress voted to support Bush's Iraq War.

Big employers should be required to contribute to mass transit solutions for their workers.  Microsoft set a good example with their Connector service!  w.r.t the 164th street station concern, they need to build the station closer to where the people and the parking will be.

Continued Liberal infighting, a succession of weak leaders and successful demonizing of them by Harper led to a majority government. After a single term of Harper majority, Canadians were so appalled that Conservative support plunged to its bedrock base level of low thirties as two out of three voters rejected them.  The Conservative Party is now paying the price for Harper's rightward shift.

With these lousy LED lights, as our incompetent motorists glance down the street while running red lights and stop signs they won't be able to discern if the coast is clear of if there is someone coming. Oh sure, our motorists could actually stop at the stop signs, but without any traffic law enforcement that's just not going to happen. Street lights should be put in place for the population we have, not the one we wish we had.  Just another instance of Eugene's Imperial city staff undermining policy as set by elected officials. Remember staff, we are supposed to be encouraging walking and cycling, not making it more dangerous. This is how we lost 37% of our cycling community back to cars.

0,"Good on you for driving slowly enough to react in time. I remember a dozen-odd years ago driving a tanker truck through Corvallis late at night. As I approached an intersection where my light had just turned green, I saw a small group of college-age people on the corner, visibly drunk. Rather than roll on through, I slowed down and, sure enough, a young woman fell out in front of me. Since I was only moving at a couple of miles per hour, I was able to stop. Her shocked companions then came out and pulled her back onto the sidewalk so I could proceed.  I've had similar things happen in Eugene and elsewhere. The key is to always anticipate the possibility that people will do something strange, dangerous and inappropriate rather than just keeping the rubber side down. Even with high-quality defensive driving, one may still overlook a clue, or have none on offer, and have a bad encounter, but we should all do what we can to reduce the odds of a collision.

By contrast in places like Africa the Churches their are booming and exploding in record numbers. Same thing in places like China and South East Asia. So people aren't really leaving Church because of those controversial issues, though it can be a fact. It's just the general trends in Western society to reject belief in God in general.

This is probably above subsidized rates, but below market rates, and it goes down over time. It greatly increases availability of medium cost accommodation without adding debt.

And don't give me any malarkey about teachers will only teach to the exams -- Doctors, plumbers, electricians etc all have to pass exams including teachers. And FYI my BOE has 55 criteria for judging teacher performance --  everything from appearance, professional growth, organizational skills, knowledge of subject etc.  Not ONE criteria regarding whether or not the students actually comprehended or learned the required information/subject.  Which should be the number one criteria.  Not that stopping bullying, or improving a student's self confidence are not important.

0,"Having been on the receiving end of Zimmerman's crummy """"journalism"""", I can appreciate the allegations that she doesn't let facts get in the way of her """"reporting"""". Nor does she admit to errors or make corrections. The fact that Fox yanked this major story off its website since it wasn't up to their standards powerfully suggests that Zimmerman's work is below those standards. I won't disagree with that. Heck, she even participated in LYING to the local media last year while a certain state senator pretended she dropped her lawsuit against him, so he could win (he didn't) and so she could get some of his earnings. Nope, the lawsuit did NOT go away and the legal maneuvering and battling between Zimmerman and her ex-boyfriend took place right under the noses of local reporters. She perpetuated a lie to get her hands on money. Sadly, that's how she also seems to be operating at FoxNews.com.

"
0,"Yes to part 1.  Supply and demand drive a market. So far demand outpaces supply. If the state and cities tax themselves out of a competitive market, there will be a glut of both homes and rental units on the market.  A glut will mean less tax monies coming in. Less tax monies means the Bond costs will be increased sans a vote.  Or the city will be bankrupted.  As for more people buying homes, well, that is what got us into the Great Recession (Depression) mess to begin with. Simpy put, spending money one does not have is not a good long-term solution. Includes schools-many of our childrens children will still be paying for school debt, on schools that no longer are in use or even exist in fact.  PS People look to today at tax histories before buying-if it has lurched up and up, they look elsewhere.

0,"""""The fear is that although the higher minimum wage is designed to boost incomes for the working poor, it would trigger employers to slash jobs to compensate for the higher labour costs.""""  Yes, that is indeed the fear that capital is attempting to propagate. The writer helpfully discloses that the data shows that jobs both proliferate and decline in the wake of minimum wage increases. However, what we do know for sure is that far too many workers are struggling in precarious employment on less than a living wage — and that must stop.  If employers are unable to pay a living wage, they need to develop a new business model or they deserve to fail.

Three quarters of Siltcoos lake is surrounded by industrial tree plantations, the earlier forests having been clearcut in the 1990s.  Industrial tree plantations are typically heavily poisoned and fertilized, especially in the Coast Range. Phosphorous, a major component of forest fertilizers, is also a major feeder for the toxic blue-green algae which has plagued Siltcoos Lake for years. And who can say how the native vegetation that filters the lakes inflowing waters has been altered by inflows of residual herbicides?  By contrast, cleaner and more drinkable Woahink Lake is surrounded by mature state forests on the west and residential development around the rest of its circumference.

In fact, the higher the cost of a project, the less likely competition will ensue.  Aside from this point, I also ask everyone to consider this.  If you were to buy 5 canadian stocks and need to assume each would be around for another 50 years in successful and profitable operation, what would they be?

The Liberals are systematically destroying the motivation for risk taking and entrepreneurship in Canada.  How is attacking those who are creating jobs and paying the most taxes in Canada (both through business and personal taxes) a sound economic strategy?  I realize that as a political ploy it has its merits but it is doomed to cause more harm than good and ultimately shrink tax revenues.

0,"I agree that the players have a right to protest.  But last year, out of a black population of 20 million, 16 unarmed black men were killed by cops, 250 including those who were armed.  And that's 2.5 times the rate of white people killed by cops relative to population.  That's bothersome.  Each year, about 2400 blacks are victims of homicide committed by other blacks about 90% of the time.  That's more bothersome.  That's what I'd be protesting if I were black.  Address that, and maybe white people would take your Black Lives Matter movement more seriously.  When blacks kill other blacks about ten times more often that cops do, apparently black lives only matter when you want to divide the country over race.

0,"Somewhere, somehow – immigration to the U.S. or Canada has morphed from a privilege to a right. Slowly those from foreign lands have infiltrated our countries, legally and illegally to the point where their voices and their needs trump our own. We have become the outsiders. My grandfather arrived on Ellis Island in April, 1900. He was told to change his name, learn English, become a productive member of and integrate into U.S. culture. He married, had two daughters one my mother, and worked as a porter in a NYC high rise. He never ONCE complained or protested. Does that sound like the immigrant of today? Dramatically call it “hate” if you wish, I couldn’t care less.  Unorthodox as Trump may be, he’s correct. You either have borders or you don’t. You can do what you like, but I’m not giving up MY country – one that I dutifully defended – to those who have little respect for our laws and customs – without a fight.

0,"Dave I find your post more to the liking of a stew.  It seems to me you are tossing sorts of entreats you conjure into the mix.  Separate facts from fiction, beliefs from what is known.  God never wrote a book,  revelation has no proof to it.  Science is the only objective method available to us to attain knowledge, to learn and to discover and to make predictions.  None of what is written about Jesus were written by Jesus, his apostles or anyone who witnessed anything of Him.  We simple do not know with certainty...we have oral tradition which extends over vast time periods from many people over and over and has less veracity than hearsay.  In regard to the Trinity;  if science does not know it, no one does, no other source has an objective method to determine it.  There is nothing objective about church apologetic and catechesis.  You keep inserting words incorrectly;  e.g. true for belief, know for believing, revealed for myth.

Nowadays, these pumped up, roid raging, returning from mideast ex-vets (who are the overwhelming new recruits in LE), many with PTSD, are given a license to play judge, jury & executioner with the badges that are handed out like candy to anyone who wants one. And the lack of oversight ensures these type of killings will only continue to happen in our communities.  To all you mean spirited, hateful commentators, let us not pretend you all have led pristine perfect lives. You haven't. There is a reason we have courts AND a right to be tried by a jury of our peers.  Seems most of you missed that important civics lesson back when you were being taught.

No quibble or argument about that.  The story is also totally newsworthy. No question.  I do believe though that the depth of reporting begged the paper asking for a response. From Callision's public statement: """" The reporting of the Record was incorrect in that I did talk to the Reporter directly about the charge and ask that he and his Editor call me back. He indicated that his Editor was gone for the day, but that they would get back to me."""" """"Prior to writing the article, the paper did not contact the treasurer to ask about the charge, did not contact me about the charge, but did however, ask people that were unaware of the circumstances and reported on their lack of knowledge and surprise of it. Again, not explaining to them what the circumstances were. """"

However, that might be due to my lack of data as I am not formally educated and trained in any of the disciplines noted. The one request I do have of the author is to more fully explain how prejudice and bias have become classified as a mental illness. Information I've read from relatively recent studies indicates that bias, if not prejudice, is a human self-defense mechanism; an evolutionary throwback. That makes some sense in that some humans, if not a majority, are """"naturally"""" suspicious of things that are new or different from the expected. I know I am. However, knowing this about myself allows me the option of yielding to my biases/prejudices, or willfully setting them aside to deal with a situation or a person in the """"here and now"""" and in a """"between you and me"""" manner rather than react from the """"there and then"""" with """"those people.""""

We're more likely to be hurt in the bathroom by the bigoted and intolerant than anyone else is by our presence-- and legislation like this will make it even more likely that a trans / gender nonconforming person (especially transwomen, the most marginalized members of the LGBT community) will be seriously hurt or killed.

The resulting external perception in the parish was that the stipend system has sort of disappear through attrition (a specifically desired result), while at the same not offending anyone.

0,"EUCHARIST, PREVISION & PROVISION In understanding Love’s universal altruism, we need to understand the grounding of Eucharistic insights in the wisdom of Isaiah, of Joseph (of Egypt) and Jesus. The Divine Insight of Pre-Vision is the insight-stimulus for Pro-Vision. God has no hands but human hands, no insight but for eyes and minds of prevision and provision. Jesus’ Universal Call to Eucharist is stark: “This is My Body... as I have done, you also must do!” The Wisdom if Isaiah understands all ‘flesh is grass’; the insight wisdom of Joseph was motivated by prevision to the action of provision, that is, to secure grain in times of plenty against years of want. Wisdom consciousness applies for all time, for all people.

However, the housing price surge extends far beyond the GTA into the GGHA. “In all seven of the Golden Horseshoe markets not included in the composite index (Barrie, Brantford, Guelph, Kitchener-Waterloo, Oshawa, Peterborough, St. Catharines–Niagara), prices were up more than 20% from a year earlier.” The reference to Vancouver without mentioning Victoria was especially strange, as inflation is running much stronger in Victoria (17.4%) than in Vancouver (8.1%) and has been for some time. The 11-city composite was up by 14.2% in June, up from 13.9% in May, an all-time record. The BoC is largely to blame for this strong surge in house prices, that it enflamed with its interest rate cuts in 2015. If this all goes Pete Tong then Poloz will have to wear it.

0,"Actually, it has nothing to do with lawyers not doing their jobs. Lawyers have a duty to their client. The SCC set out a test for unreasonable delay. Lawers make the applications when the court/crown fail to get a case on in a reasonable time.  The cause of a lengthy trial is attributed to a number of factors, but have you ever considered it is the police's insistence on collecting (and the Crown's insistence on leading) copious am mounts of evidence, oftentimes obtained in violation of basic rights, that may delay a trial?  Or, perhaps, you hadn't considered the government's delay in appointing judges to fill vacancies? Can't run a trial without a judge.  Everyone seems to want to blame lawyers, but they have no understanding of what lawyers do, or how little money criminal counsel (Crown and defence) make. Check out legal aid rates in BC, then divide that by the number of hours responsible counsel take to work a case.  Learn something, anything about the justice system.

The rate increases in actual dollars are only $27 to $43 per month for all but the very large boats (over 45 feet) which can go up to $61.  That seems to make the idea of unaffordability rather silly (that would be curtailing 2 bottles of wine a month - on which I spend my disposable income).  Yachts are not necessities but rather hobbies – i.e. discretionary income.  The property tax increases that are the alternative to raising rates are definitely not disposable income.  You cannot opt out by moving your house. If the Port decides to go forward with an Industrial Development Corporation, the Port’s property tax  rate will double for every home owner in Jefferson county, the vast majority of whom do not use or gain any benefit from the marinas.

But the problem was Harper stopped the LPC cuts in personal income tax rates when he came to office and switched to boutique tax credits and fiddled with the margins. If he'd have given ALL Canadians a tax break we'd have seen a boosted consumer spending. The corp cut lead to the loss of  3/4's by the multiplier factor. Those dollars didn't shrink it, but it would have grown it.  Yes, some got spent on infrastructure but over 1/2 of his bloated stimulus fund went to buying votes with make work projects that didn't create jobs. btw, over 60% of it went to Reform riding's.

And we all know why Trudeau won't go this route unless public indignation forces his hand.  He cannot get elected with just a 40% popular vote. And those 35% who refused to vote in 2015 would come off the sidelines to ensure that.  So, he gives us the finger. But forces can be mobilized that will force his hand.

0,"Kenneth Conklin,  Your reading appears to equate """"rights"""" with """"rights of property"""" and to exclude """"rights of person"""".  A right of property is an exclusive claim to the use and enjoyment of something.  A right of person is a claim that one cannot be excluded from the use and enjoyment of something.  It is understandable that you might equate """"rights"""" with """"rights of property"""" because our society today typically uses the term in this way.  However, in old Hawai`i rights of property were circumscribed in their application and rights of person were widely employed.  If one reads """"ancestral rights"""" as a mixture of rights of person and rights of property, then the claim that affirming them means """"we're gonna take over the whole place"""" is misleading, at best.

Number of personnel reduced, all in the name of cost saving and the false belief that they were no longer needed.   It was the same problem we faced at the beginning of WWII.   The left is still trying to kill the military. Obama just destabilized a number of countries and made the world a less safe place.  Clinton was no military leader.

Willamette, Quiet Zones, City Hall, etc.  With well timed new individual tax measures calculated to maximize their chance of passage rather than a """"best guess"""" comprehensive and prioritized list of civic needs presented to the community.

0,"Exactly right Rick. Fact is because the State failed to provide transportation alternatives in keeping with the Oahu General Plan the City with it's limited resources was forced to build rail. The shibai is legislators are having people believe this is a Honolulu City & County project while in fact this is a project which will affect most of the States population and jobs. The completion of rail will generate economic growth which means higher revenues from state income taxes as well as the GET tax. The real winner will be state tax revenues.

Immigration regulation is purely a federal function, and the police departments of 600 counties across the nation have decided not to work with the federal immigration agency because of its hyper-aggressive tactics that generate fear in their communities.  Instead, these counties want to keep the peace.  Trump may be able to withhold federal funds related to immigration, but because it's a federal function, the counties don't get much if anything.  Nevertheless, San Francisco has sued the federal government to prevent any loss of federal funds.  More local jurisdictions are sure to follow, just as states have joined in the effort to stop Trump's immigration executive order.

Equality is a policy to not prejudge individuals based on empirical evidence, or statistics of a group they may belong too. Every individual must be based on their own competency, experience, merit and wisdom.  Mr Damores expresses this very sentiment and stated inequity in hiring is not based on unconscious bias or prejudicial beliefs. But the personal choices women make of their own free will. The real differences between men and women and the diverse groups we all belong to, is not based on personal observation but numerous case study reports and systematic scientific evaluation and investigation.  Personal experiences are not necessarily reliable ways to base facts or research. Ms Henein confuses equality of opportunity (a worthy goal) and equality of outcome (not realistic).

And that is why the Secretary of State for Colorado may remove any elector who fails to follow those instructions.  They are delegates of the State acting on the specific and lawful instructions of the State of Colorado legislature.  Remember, the Constitution of the United States (plural) of America specifically and unequivocally leaves to the legislatures of the member States to decide how the electors are selected.

The behavior that we tolerate as a generation will be accepted behavior by the next generation. For too long, many bad behaviors by our children were tolerated because some of us chose to turn a blind a eye and not want to deal with it or that's the way we were raised so we copy it...

Kiz has made it known he thinks Lynch is the guy, or wants him to be the guy, so it is refreshing that he is openly questioning whether Lynch can get the job done. Siemian is Brian Hoyer, Fitzpatrick, Brian Griese and every other very average QB rolled into one. The way I see is this way: Siemian is a safe pick that will help keep the Broncos offense very average or below average. Lynch has a chance to make the Broncos explosive and very dangerous...but he needs a lot more reps. Remember, he is just a second year guy with very little experience. So how does he get experience? He has to be given a chance to play and make mistakes and move on from them. Denver is in a tough position, they have a championship defense but a QB problem...at least for now. If I could make the choice it would be Lynch to start unless he got soundly beat in the preseason games.

The people of Virginia, fought, lost, and suffered for their decision. Lee was Virginian, a US Army officer who served with distinction, he resigned his commission because he believed that his loyalty was to Virginia first.  His family fought for both North and South and suffered loss.  He lost his citizenship though was eventually pardoned and like, many US presidents until that time, he was a slaver and racist.

(""""Positive"""" in the sense of a feedback cycle that moves a complex system further from stabilization. Another example is the melting of the Arctic ice and global warming. A negative feedback cycle, like a thermostat, stabilizes a system.)  Most of the poor and near poor -- the working class -- are white, and I think they are becoming more likely to explode also. There are other ways to kill people than using a weapon. A documentary on health care I watched said that the main determinant of health is income. The main reason is stress, caused by financial pressure. Stress sets people off. For example, when unemployment rises so does child and wife abuse. We need to do something about our economy. Either create more government jobs or set up a guaranteed annual income.

Never leave your drink unattended, keep track of your friends, text your friends when you get home safely, don't walk home alone, especially when you've been drinking.  Until recently, we have been telling women how to keep themselves safe and have not been focusing on educating people on issues like consent and respecting a woman's right to act however she likes and still be completely justified in saying no.  Don't worry, women still know that they're risking being victims every time they drink.  We would just like to not have to be scolded at our court cases.

0,"Ok, since no one at SA seems to know how to write an informative article, here's some background info (from WebMD.com):  Enterococci bacteria live in our intestines and on our skin, usually without causing problems. But if they become resistant to antibiotics, they can cause serious infections, especially in people who are ill or weak.... Some common sites include the intestines, the urinary tract, and wounds.  If you are healthy, your chances of getting a Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection are very low. Even if you have been exposed to VRE, or have VRE in your body, you are not likely to get an infection. VRE infections typically only occur among people who have weakened immune systems, such as people who have long-term illnesses or people who have had major surgery or other medical procedures and have been treated with multiple antibiotics.

0,"Opinions vary, what most have not picked up on, including the globe, is that the pesticide regulations are very clear: it is the licensed applicator that is ultimately responsible, even when employed by the company and directed to use an unregistered and thereby illegal substance, the company can be held liable.. The company spokesperson lied when they stated that the nutrient spray ( aka a foliar feed) was not labeled properly. In Canada, a pesticide label is a legal contract and is required for all registered products. Unregistered,  unlabeled or mislabled product is against the law to use in this country. Two separate, unregistered pesticides were used- this equates to systemic criminality. The gov't is covering up illegal, unethical, and harmful behavior on the part of a regulated operator.

And at the same time we continue to do nothing about climate change and to devastate the environment. What are some possible cures. The initial move is to normalize the taxation system so that it stops picking winners and awarding capital over labor. Then we must make investments in the kind of public goods that will drive long-term wealth creation, the most important being education. Longer term we have to change models of ownership and we may need a guaranteed minimum income. The policies proposed by Donald Trump and Kevin O'Leary will just make the current situation worse.

0,"The main difference between a DB plan and a DC plan is who carries the risk of a shortfall. In a DB plan, if the pension fund earns smaller than anticipated returns, the employer has to make up the difference, whereas in a DC plan, smaller than anticipated returns mean smaller than anticipated pensions. The flip side of this is that if the fund earns larger than anticipated returns, in a DB plan the employer gets the surplus, whereas in a DC plan the employees get larger than anticipated pensions.  If the actuaries, like Mr. Vetesse, do their calculations properly, the surpluses and shortfalls will even out over the long term, which means that over that same long term either pension scheme costs the employer the same amount. Given that, it is clear to me that a DB plan is the better choice, as it costs the employer nothing and produces fairer, more consistent results for the pensioners.

She didn't even try to do the right thing...not once.  If someone dies through your actions, you are legally obligated to render aid or at least stay at the scene.  She did neither.  I don't understand how anyone can sympathize with a murderer who leaves another person to die instead of the victim who will never be able to give his version of the story to doctors and police.

My conflict comes from the fact that Republicans have offered nothing to the black community of significance.   The absurd claim that the poor have anything close to equal opportunity is just a self-righteous excuse that keeps them from seeing their clear advantages.  Combine the oppressive nature of poverty, with the clear negative stereotyping of black people and you have a witch's brew that kills opportunity.  There is a long list of failed policies, (mostly Democratic initiatives) that have not addressed the root causes of poverty.    In some cases policy has institutionalized poverty.  Many of these policies were made with good intentions but poor design and little accountability to the goal of lessoning poverty.  These are serious issues that should be addressed.  The bigotry of political ideology cripples rational policy making.

There is also the fact that in the last election, with a Liberal leader from a Quebec riding, the Conservative party increased its seat count from 5 to 10, with Mad Max at bat, versus zero seats in the Maritime provinces. Bernier's French is a delight and his English is better than Jean Chretien's, according to Max.  The chances of defeating the Liberals are far better with a credible leader from Quebec with actual  business credentials, versus any of the other candidates, including Scheer who has none. Without the Quebec vote, the Conservatives will lose for sure, particularly against a  Liberal leader from a Quebec riding. This  is why the Conservatives have no alternative, despite the number of contestants.

The notion that success in business is a necessary and sufficient condition for success as Prime Minister is ludicrous, if only because there is far more to a country and society than the economy.  It is a critical component as the engine that generates the wealth that is the source of revenue for public activities, but it is only one facet of a country.  If one could run a government as a company, with the focus only on the bottom line, then it would be a business.  Government takes on those activities that the private sector is incapable of assuming because the considerations go beyond simple profit and loss.

There is a 100 plus year supply of natural gas in the Cook Inlet, according to the research of the USGS.  Fairbanks and the Richardson Highway route currently does not have any affordable gas- but the route to Nikiski ignores that. (Why throw them under the bus?)  A routing to Valdez fixes that problem, and opens up the prospects for mineral resource development where affordable natural gas is important.  The marine pilots know that shipping delays from the Cook Inlet due to ice, winds, and tides actually make the shipping more expensive than coming from the ice free port of Valdez.

A better phrasing might be “sexual depravity”.  It includes adultery, fornication, prostitution, homosexual relations, incest, group activities, and so on. It is a very negative word. One would not use it for the average adulterer.  What it is describing is someone who is incapable of contracting a marriage because they cannot be monogamous.

I know from experience. The correct firearm and ammunition used correctly will drop any bear in its tracks. That is a fact. The caveat is """"used correctly.""""  You simply cannot go to the hardware store and buy a rifle and think that is it.  You need to learn how to use it.  Marksmanship at bear defense ranges is really not an issue.  ADF&G recommends not letting the bear get closer than 17 yards.  That is point and shoot range with a rifle.  You do not need bench rest accuracy at that range.  BTW, ADF&G and many other real experts recommend that no so called warning shots be made. Too many things can happen including jamming the rifle and they rarely deter the bear. Bears are used to gun shots. In fact hunting on the Alaska Peninsula we used to say shooting a caribou was ringing the dinner bell for bears.

0,"If I remember rightly 'substantia' means the underlying reality, thus we say the Real Presence. The accidents of bread and wine retain their physical properties but in reality are no longer bread and wine but the very Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The word substance has many meanings in English including a philosophical meaning akin to the Latin, 'that which stands beneath'. Most Catholics will not be aware of this and need not understand Aristotelian metaphysics. Most Catholics can not be expected to be philosophers and theologians and therefore acceptance of what the Church teaches is essential. In this matter the Church says to its members that the bread and wine cease to exist at the Consecration. From then on they are the actual Body and Blood of Christ regardless of whether one believes it or not: it is, in fact a miracle effected by the Words of Institution.  If you believe it you are a Catholic, if you don't, you are not.

0,"There are a number of factors that seem to have been lost in the discussion regarding DACA.  One is that DACA is blatantly unconstitutional as has been already adjudicated in the courts.  Any lack of """"humanity"""" or """"charity"""" can be blamed directly on Congress for a failure to act both in regard to immigration law enforcement, and to immigration law revisions.  Another is the fact that none of the beneficiaries of the DACA program are children, they are now adults, many with children of their own.  There are many arguments on both sides with regard to cost/benefits ratios of allowing illegal aliens to remain in this country, however, none of those arguments is germane to the issue at hand.  The predominant issue is that every DACA beneficiary could have by now, applied for, and probably been approved for, citizenship in accordance with the law but they have purposefully chosen not to do so.  We should welcome immigration but we must insist it be in accordance with our laws.

So then they forced everyone to pay for your health care by forcing everyone to have insurance and giving out subsidies to those who couldn't afford it. Then with everyone forced into the system, of course insurance rates are flying through the ceiling because insurance companies have a captive audience now.  Most people could pay their own medical costs out of pocket just with what the deductibles and co pays cost them each year. So what is the point of also paying a monthly fee to an insurance company so they can pay your bill for you, (after you have met your deductible), if they decide that your condition is cover-able and you go to the Dr they tell you to?

Conversely, if they are not """"likeable"""" we will not vote for them no matter how good their ideas might be.

First, is it historically true that women referred to as deacons in our past were ordained in the same sense that male deacons were and are ordained -- that is, did these women received the sacrament of Holy Orders (in Eastern terms, Cheirotonia; in Western terms, a major order); or did they not not receive the sacrament, but rather merely a minor order (the Western term), or Cheirothesis (the Eastern term)? It is universally accepted that if women were ordained deacon in this precise sense in the past, then the Church has the authority to again ordain women to the sacrament of Holy Orders as deacons.  Secondly, assuming a positive answer to the first question, should the Church re-establish the female diaconate?

But you don’t play politics with the military and have it turn out well.  My standard from day one has been if you meet the standards you’re in.   You don’t meet the standards you’re out.  But the POLICY implemented at the last second should not ‘automatically’ be upheld when a president reverts to a very longstanding and tested policy.   Even if I disagreed with the policy the court should give deference to the longstanding policy over the hastily thought out and not implemented yet policy.    And yes those members in the military that are transgender are STILL in violation of policy and have been the entire time.   And no they can’t claim they didnt know.

SCO now covers all major states in Asia with India and Pakistan just joined. SCO is Sino-Russia version of G7+NATO, with population a few times bigger, military power bigger, but economic power less. SCO is bound by treaty and cannot be cancelled with a change of leaders. It glues the strategic alliance of China, Russia, India with smaller states in-between.

As it was as an employee of the University her daily bread and income depended on continued approval from the bosses over there.  When the University's lawyer calls her and tells her to do something, resistance can be seen as insubordination providing for her immediate termination.  Now Mr. Park, the lawyer, on the other hand made the decision (apparently) to violate confidentiality rules and use his authority as general counsel to order employee Kerr to deliver the confidential file.  Did Mr. Park get censured for his abuse of power?  Do we really want to force employees to act insubordinate to their bosses and risk losing their careers?  Blame should be assigned to those in power not to those whose entire life structure could be destroyed by acting insubordinate.

0,"The Civil War is a very fascinating part of history.  As a child, I became fascinated with it because of Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves. I suppose part of my fascination as a child was that the nuns taught us that the war was fought to free the slaves. When it came to slaves, I didn't think of them as all being black. Very few blacks in N.M. then. I held this belief because in our tribe, villages and family we knew that the Spanish and the Mexicans had enslaved Native Americans. We knew that among the tribes there had been slaves. I read every book I could find about the people on both sides. I made a report on Stonewall Jackson I never looked at either side as being good or bad. Maybe because after the Civil War, so many people moved West. I may have considered it more of an invasion by the US Military. I kept my interest in the Civil War, eventually I visited the Ford Theater and the room across the street where Lincoln died.

0,"The word """"science"""" means knowledge. The method for gathering knowledge of the natural world is through careful, documented observation, often of a controlled experiment based on a hypothesis and a simplified situation. The results are predictive knowledge that is generalizable, but often at a simplistic level that is blind to nature's most complex creations - healthy, stable ecosystrms.  Traditional knowledge is also based on careful observation,  but usually of complex, real-world ecological interactions where one lives.  It is also useful, but is more grounded in particular places (this valley, this forest, this prairie) and less generalizable. The depth of this ecological knowledge is impressive, and produces a sophisticated spiritual appreciation of our planet.  As humanity uses Western science to exploit, monetize and destroy the ecosystems on which we depend, there is a need to learn from the traditional wisdom of first peoples. Otherwise, our species will go extinct.

Their next (inevitable) move comes in 5-6 year, on the downside of the cycle when they rescind these rules, because there has been no new needed supply of affordable housing. Why is it so hard to understand, editorial board? Affordable housing supply is driven by profitable development - you take away one, and you loose the other. 1, 2, 3. And the reason why you lose profitable development is because the home buying public is not willing to accept these onerous conditions on their home ownership: requiring those restrictions makes government your landlord - you share your equity, you have to live there for 30 years.

Sometimes these citizens doing the buying of existing housing stock and facilitating these new builds are absolutely the """"citizens of convenience"""" that all """"foreign buyer"""" measures fail to address (because the issue is actually """"foreign money"""" and our lack of control around that entering the country, not being reported as income, etc.).  These approaches from NZ and Australia are not a great fix. Better more effective measures exist.

First process is for each to tell their story about the crime and what they were thinking/feeling.   The learning starts as each has to repeat what they heard and they go through that until both agree on the story.   They the second person speaks and tells their story, Same process, same repeat what you heard....  The amazing thing about that type of mediation is the sense of a connection that it builds between the victim and the offender.   My roll was to keep the process in focus, not to solve the mediation.     It is amazing to see how many times the offender feels remorse (most had no idea of the effect of say a small robbery), and suggest a harsh correction in their 'contract' with the victim, only for the victim to forgive them and build a more relational solution.   We went from crime the start of friendship.  Thank you for this series Sharon

Therefore, I support gay marriage as a legal right but not as a personal freedom for believers (just as I don't support believers who engage in sexual immorality, greed, racism, pride, etc...)  Just as God gives us the freedom to choose to follow him, His followers should extend the same grace and freedom to others to choose their own beliefs (so long as it doesn't restrict or oppress others).

While our enemies threaten us, it is far easier to bind together our citizens against them than it is to keep Americans believing there has to be those whose lives are not worth of medical services. Our social norms will eventual y  solve the health care mess.

It feels like Vancouver continues to get more congested while mayor Moonbeam simultaneously reduces parking and converts streets to new bike-lines - he is a cyclist zealot with a contempt for common sense and rational thought. A couple of bike lanes might have been reasonable but for a city that rains 8 months a year, why are they building bike lanes on every second street? How do people in Vancouver take it, it's gridlock every single day. Is Moonbeam trying to frustrate drivers into giving up? Considering the cost of living is so expensive, most people don't have a choice because their commute is over an hour long each way. Every visit to the city is more congested from the airport and it feels like the construction on the Burrard bridge has been going on for over 2 years... China could build the bridge in half that time.

I'd rather risk the bite than take a life, but I also wouldn't allow harm to a child.  From what I've read, it seems a few factors lead to this tragedy.  The lack of physical restraint for the dog, the parking of the vehicle right on the boundary of the dog's turf, the stress of moving perhaps?  A series of conditions that lead to a moment of tragedy, imho.

In 1989, RULES were passed to deal with the resort activities that were destroying our residential communities. Our City Counsel refuses to pass TOOLS to enforce the laws. Bill 22 would add enforcement tools that would help to stop this illegal activity. 1000's of rental units would be available in a very short time. This law has been sitting the the Zoning Committee for 17 months with no action. Shame on our Council Members who allowing this. We will never solve our housing problems without enforcing our zoning laws. This would cost nothing to the County. It would cause some revenue loss of to the illegals and the business that  have grown to support them. Do we support unsustainable development, or as our Governor intends, do we support our kupuna, ourselves and our children. RULES without enforcement TOOLS = ANARCHY.

A crisis is a time of intense danger, often in which a decision will result in a fundamental change.  Per the recent statements by the Secretaries of Defense and State, as well as Ambassador Haley, NSA Director McMaster and  President Trump, the US:  a) either has or has almost run out of diplomatic options regarding NK;  b) will not tolerate a NK which has the capability to hit the US with thermonuclear weapons.  This situation is a paradigm of crisis.  NK is not going to give up their WMDs willingly.

But upon his death the neocon moneyed Demos hijacked his progressive revolution morphing it into Kaliphate of gore, glory, conquest, and colonialism, picking needless fight with Christians, imposing Tariffs (Arabic word) on East-West trade, finally blocking it altogether thus starving Christian Europe into half, and forcing them to find new routes to Asia and new lands.

Death in that huge market. 4. More of Canada's small cohort of movie goers prefer broad-based youth comedies (such as the films you mention) that war movies...

It is called a contract; and in order for it to be a valid contract all parties must be voluntary and willing participants. Why an individual chooses not to enter into a contract is irrelevant, for the contract to be valid it must be willingly entered into or else the contract is invalid. Law students learn this in their first contract law class. Doesn't matter if the contract is to provide a custom cake on a specified date, or build a custom home to the specifications of a homeowner, or to mow a property owners lawn every Tuesday prior to sunset.  No one, since the passage of the 13th Amendment, has the right to unilaterally decide someone else must labor for their benefit involuntarily.

Sure some homes can be bought and sold in a manner to yield gains.  But those gains can only be utilized if you are able to unlock them.  So unless you decide to sell and rent, downsize, move to a cheaper location, or take in tenants your gains are not accessible.  Most people who choose to own their own house do not seek out those options.  As a result in most cases the mortgage expense should be viewed as a household expenditure (i.e. prepaid rent), not an alternative investment option to conventional fixed income or equity based investments.

0,"The Conservatives fought the last election promising to create a barbaric cultural practices hotline, where people could report on actual or potential crimes like honour killings and female genital mutilation. Sounds like gender-related violence to me. This was prompted by actual outrages like the Shafia-family murders where three young girls and their stepmother were murdered in an honour killing. This was also gender-related violence. PM Trudeau stated as Liberal critic for citizenship and immigration that he thought the state should take a neutral position towards such crimes, and only climbed down when his tweet caused a huge wave of outrage from the Canadian public. The Liberals attacked the idea of the hotline as Islamophobe, although it was set up partly in reaction to serious crimes by people of other faiths. Now the Liberals’ sudden concern for gender-related violence seems a tad hypocritical.

The people are led to believe that their nuclear program is necessary to protect them and that because of their military strength,  no other country in the world will dare to mess with them.  Joint pressure from China and the USA will put significant pressure on NK.  South Korea, imho, is the key.  South Korea has much to gain from relations with China as well.  China is pushing technological innovation for the future.  Trillions of dollars are being tapped from its own population and are being directed to the growth and future of their country.

1,"The story damning the President for compromising highly sensitive classified information is based on these “sources”:  >> “The Washington Post reported” >> “Three White House officials” >> “current and former U.S. officials” >> “anonymous officials” >> “intelligence professionals”  Is it any wonder that President Trump’s identification of our so called “news” media as the enemy of the people has resonated like a gong? This is but one example of the fake “news” that has gushed forth like a torrent of raw sewage to promote a particular a political narrative over the last two years.  Mark Twain observed a lie can travel round the world three times while Truth is looking for Her sandals. Honolulu Star-Advertiser would be wise to heed the corollary: Once Truth DOES don Her winged sandals, She will mercilessly run down the lie . . . AND THE LIARS.

Philips didn't, despite the deceptive headline used by the DPEB, refuse to sell a cake to the homosexual couple, he refused to be hired by them to bake a cake of their choosing at a date of their choosing.  That's refusing to enter into a contract with another party, it has not a single thing to do with serving the public.  When one wishes to contract for your labor you have a right to refuse the contract.  If you don't, then you can be compelled to involuntarily labor for the benefit of another and the 13th Amendment is void, not to mention the whole of our contract law which says both parties must be willing participants to the contract for the contract to be valid.

A difficulty with the inductive method is that biases often enter the observation and identify an observation as diagnostic evidence when it is not.  An issue with the abductive method is that of finding an atomic explanation for a particular observation or series of observations.  The deductive method provides the greatest epistemic value in that, if one follows the rules of validity and soundness, final knowledge is certain.

When Morneau introduced Bill C-27, legislation to make it easier for federal employees to move to a targeted benefit pension, a move which would benefit Morneau Shepell, the company’s stock went up 4.8 per cent within days, Cullen says. Morneau, he said, would have made $2 million in five days from that jump.

Every step of the way successive governments going back to PET have deepened this relationship selling it to Canadians as being good for jobs and good for the economy.  The Harper Government was no less guilty. Canada bled close to 180,000 high paying manufacturing jobs during his tenure.  History has proven without a doubt that trade with China has decimated our middle class, especially that area of the middle class with its foundation in the manufacturing sector.  There is no question that we will see Trudeau rubber stamp free trade with China. It is a done deal. It has been bought and paid for by corrupt communist Party influencers in bed with the LPC.

Indeed, for solidarity's sake, divorced Catholics and normal Catholic couples should simply ignore the institutional Church until it apologizes and performs weddings for everyone. It won't take long. Weddings are big business for any parish.

Specific racial groups were targeted, as King Kalakaua did with the Japanese, and Portuguese. On November 24, 1882, Hawaii's Envoy to Japan, Kapena, read an official statement to the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Inouye, a prepared message from King Kalakaua he said: """"We believe the Japanese and the Hawaiians spring from a cognate race and that Japanese children growing up and amalgamating with our population will produce a new and vigorous race, which will repeople our Islands"""".

When the sun is shining (and the wind is blowing) such that power production exceeds demand, water is pumped uphill into reservoirs. When the sun goes down (or the wind stops blowing)  and demand exceeds power supply, this water is allowed to flow down through turbines to provide power.  There are other storage options coming on line, such as the growing electric car market (currently confined almost exclusively to California, the state with the lowest energy use per capita). These car batteries can be used to buffer demand bumps. There are also other large scale battery systems coming on line, but none of them are as efficient as pumped water storage.

Unlike the US if you are suspected of leaking classified information in NK you don't get a bi line on CNN you get a bullet in the head. Don't get me wrong. I am all for a direct military confrontation with NK. I am 65 years old now. The US should have pulled out if Korea decades ago. Let the NK and SK slug it out.

What these and at least some liberals do not get is that most conservatives DO respect women.   The only thing is that people like me think that men and women have different roles to play in society.   Neither one greater or worse than the other.  These male bashers see the verses in the Bible that describe the role wives are supposed to play and either totally ignore or are blinded to the verses that the husband is supposed to play. I also do not agree that being a guy is necessarily the best deal.  This was especially true in the 60's, but is still true today.  How many things have guys traditionally bought for women?

FYI, NK is expressly developing WMDs to threaten to kill you as well as millions of others in the free world for strategic leverage in order to re-unite the Korean Peninsula under Kim's dystopian, dynastic tyranny.  Any sentient being who heard Trump discussing the the """"Fire & fury"""" outcome would not respond by threatening to bracket Guam with missiles.  But that's exactly what the madman with nukes did.  Kim's response was one of surreal insanity.

0,"Yes, there are government programs that benefit us. You probably get government services I don't, even though I pay considerable taxes.   People who have children pay more on main street and invest into our society more than people who don't.  A tax credit for these children means the money stays in the local community to be spent.  It benefits the community. People who have children care  about the community and that makes the world a better place.  While the likes of you advocate for anarchy and abject poverty and a complete break down of society that depends on families.  What is also interesting is how you Trolls oppose abortion, but do not support health care during pregnancy or after the child is born.  You oppose access to birth control and family planning,  and then complain when they are born and oppose support.  We already have an astounding child poverty rate and child hunger, but the callous, corrosive alt right are just fine this. Do you call yourself Christian too?
