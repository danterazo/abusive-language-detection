0,"There was no """"lack of competition for manufacturing jobs from less expensive overseas plants"""" at that time. That was pretty much gone by the end of the Marshall Plan in 1951. The tax structures in place at the time made it more advantagious to keep high end manufacturing jobs in the USA. And it was more the early 1980's than the late 1970's when that productivity/salary split manifested.

Hillary is one of the most disgusting people to ever run for President yet the Media and left wing just chose to ignore what she has done and did their best to shove her down our throats. Trump wasn't MY first choice either but HE IS NOW GOING TO BE OUR PRESIDENT.  Comparing him to Hitler is idiotic at best. He will do far better than Obama and we don't have Hillary's criminal past or support for the murder of Gays and Christians and poor treatment of women to explain to the world..

Would he say tax those middle class and lower class Alaskans?  Would he say take away their pfd check and give it to the government?  Oh, he says only the rich will pay.  How many rich people do we have in Alaska?  Two dozen?  Three Dozen? Ten Dozen?  The richest people who live in Alaska work for the State, Federal, local, municipal, town, city, boroughs, prisons, schools in Alaska.  They don't want to feel any pain.  They want the rest of us to.

0,"Trump needed to pay attention to this matter long before now.  Lifting the Jones Act now is okay as far as that goes, but what Puerto Rico needs is a full mobilization of our relief efforts, the works.  Probably the most dire need is for heavy lift helicopters, why haven't our full efforts already been mobilized?  Trump was too busy working up his racist fellows to worry about more brown people, even if they were Americans.  Trump has got to be removed from office.  His actions are indefensible.  Plus, as has been pointed out by others here, he's a traitor about to be indicted.  Hurry up, Mueller, people are dying and Trump shouldn't be allowed to be the cause of any more death.

0,"I wear a fur hat on the desperately cold winter days that occur frequently during an Alberta winter. The fur is wild-trapped muskrat fur........exactly the same as the Mounties wear in the winter out here in the west. Being a folliclely challenged man,  this muskrat fur hat keeps my cranium nice and toasty during the -40 days that happen from time to time during a prairie winter.  I have yet to be called out for wearing this hat. Muskrats are abundant in my part of the world. They are not called 'rats' for nuthin'.

If that's colonialism then that's poorly structured colonialism. Also, how can it be colonialism when the supposed """"colonizers"""" are giving you equall everything - citizenship, mobility, economics, etc. Your trapped in your own mind's colonialism.

0,"As much of a milestone this is, Canadians are dealing with a variety of challenges that are more critical right now.  Many are facing financial challenge and need to work through this.  We continue to have health care challenges in terms of availability of care and wait times for often critical treatment. It is perhaps difficult to celebrate when dealing with these types of situations.  It seems even those of us who had high hopes for a positive impact of a Trudeau government may be disappointed.  In retrospect, as someone who supported Justin Trudeau, I believe many of us may have  dismissed Mr. Harper too quickly.  In the future, I hope we can elect someone who will do the better job and not simply someone we might enjoy as a dinner guest.

Hold them to it.  The politicians are in charge of ALL of this.  Somebody needs to do a massive forensic audit of all of this and include the politicians and labor bosses, lobbyists as well.  If they are guilty, throw them in jail and take it all back.  Check their net worths, RECENT investments.  Follow the money.  Somebody is stealing massively here and it all comes back to the politicians and the labor bosses.  They have the control of the money. They are all stealing in plain sight.

0,"""""immigration tends to raise GDP per capita.""""  Absolutely incorrect.  Immigration reduces per capita income and just about every model shows this.  This has been known since the early '70s.  And if you want proof in the real world model, Canada has had an extremely high rate of immigration and the lowest rate of productivity increase in the OECD.  Our equality level has fallen from second best in the early 60s to mid - 20s now.  Mass immigration is a trickle up policy.  Cheers, John Meyer

0,"What needs to happen here is what the R-G published a story on last week in Deschutes. A group calling itself the Deschutes Collaborative Forest Project, made up of loggers and enviros, was cooperating on a thinning project in the Cascades that provided a firefree summer for the town in question.  http://deschutescollaborativeforest.org/  The irony of all this is that there is plenty of work to be done by loggers in the restoration of our western forests, just as there is work for enviros in figuring out how to do the restoration and then monitoring it.  These folks from the DCFP could negotiate an end to the stand off and oversee the logging in the Goose. I wonder if they'd be interested. I bet the Cascades Forest Defenders would accept mediation if the DCFP was involved.

0,"It's not possible that the world has swung too far toward """"lefty"""" globalism, because neoliberalism is not lefty, it is far right. And neoliberalism was initiated by Thatcher and Reagan and most people have been saying that Trump will be quite similar to Reagan. Trump is beyond conservative and has taken politics back into fascism. This is obvious. He has stated that he wishes to dismantled the state and is now installing family members in close positions around him.  I don't know what you think is social liberal, but pro-life, hard on crime and increased domestic surveillance and profiling is not liberal.  Disregard for crimes against humanity and a police state is not liberal and it is coming.  He is obviously setting up the CIA and US intelligence for a house cleaning. By the time he is through the US may not have a legitimate election system in place. Are you old enough to even know or pay attention to the lessons of history? I do not think so.

Sorry to burst your greasy bubble but opinion polls show a majority of Greater Vancouver citizens oppose the project.  Among other municipal leaders, the Mayors of Vancouver, and Burnaby ( where the terminal in located) oppose the project. The BC gov't, though not opposed, has a very long & stringent list of requirements the project must prove it can meet before the BC gov't will approve it. Two thirds of first nations affected are opposed.  Vancouverites  & BC-ers won't agree to see their city & province  be made a colony of Calgary & its Big Oil masters - no matter what PM Trudeau, or Christy Clark think about it. It's not Calgary's  harbour that's at risk. Albertans don't give a flying****. But BC-ers do. The project's  D.O.A.

Average lifespan of a Doug Fir seedling is less than a 80 years with only the heartiest of the species existing in the proper climate making it to 400+ years. As far as management.  Our National Forests, being the ones destroyed by wildfire, releasing carbon, killing endangered species, despoiling our air and water have not been managed for the last 30 years.  That is when the enviro whackos found they could sue and settle, halting virtually all management prescriptions on OUR National Forests.

Trump's goal was simply to win with any means possible, and there is no doubt that his appeal to the fears and prejudices of his based worked.  Trump's widely acknowledged propensity to change his position on a whim gives him an unusual amount of wiggle room for whatever policies his administration decides to pursue.  He might decide to continue Obamacare with minor fixes, recommend left-leaning Supreme Court nominees, and maintain Obama's foreign policy, all under the guise of a """"new"""" Trump direction, and his base would still love him and the GOP Congress could not object.

Morris and Speer imagined they contained millions, when they might have merely contained pennies.  Anyhow, they argued then that the USA should release all those funds to them, because Omar was nothing more than a pawn of his father, with no autonomy.

0,"I never understood how the Church could be neutral with respect to the taking of a human life.  But this idea that the reason for the Church to re-assess its position is in part due to increased """"social maturity"""" is laughable at best.  Western social maturity has been on a decline most ostensibly since the post-1960s era where adolescent, naive perspectives on sex, drugs, war and peace were/are being adopted by adults.  The """"socially mature"""" view on the death penalty requires a complex examination of the life of the criminal weighed against the lives of the victims' family and friends, as well as the whole of society.  The """"socially immature"""" view is that killing is """"bad"""" so we shouldn't do it.  This """"socially mature"""" argument is used conversely on liberal views of sexual conduct.  The argument is that sexual restrictions treat us like children, and we are mature enough as a society to have those restrictions relieved.  Results prove otherwise.

0,"Wasn't it one of Parnell's policies that anyone who wanted access to gas line information had to swear an oath to never reveal that information? Is that still in effect under Walker? Seems to me that if the oil industry was operating as good faith partners they would have no qualms about telling the State Division of Oil and Gas what their plans are. The whole idea of """"proprietary corporate information"""" is easily abused as a shield to hide behind. Like Senator Wielochowski's law suit against the Governor the State may need the courts to decide just what is and isn't """"proprietary information"""". I do not trust the oil industry to operate in good faith and this lack of releasing information in a timely manner is a very clear indication that that lack of trust is warranted. Trust but verify right Mr Brown?

0,"I agree it is the republicans but why it is their fault is where we differ. When they had the vote to repeal ACA they voted for but under the conditions they knew it wouldn't become law. It is the same tactic that they did with the Patriot Act. Majority of people didn't want it, Obama ran on repealing it and what happened, the Obama presidency strengthened it. Well the Republicans tried the same tactic and now both parties are trying to figure out why it didn't work. The reason is they got over confident. Because over the past 100 years the same tactic has been used but they didn't count on the American public and a few good politicians standing in their way. I believe they figured they could come up with any law and claim it repealed the ACA and the public would just follow like sheep. Well they were proven wrong just as the Democrats are being proven wrong the way they have been pushing their agenda for so long. An informed public has awoken and I think it is because most hate trump.

The scholarly as well as fake news reporting is that Jong Un was himself brainwashed into viewing relinquishment of nukes and WMD as the central act that led to the downfall of Libya (which Jong Un was implored not to let happen). So, NK is left with the option of getting rid of nukes, and dealing with Trump post nuclear, or standing and fighting. Conventional, """"civilized"""" western sensibilities instruct that when confronted with existential consequences, you capitulate. Is NK capable of thinking in """"conventional, """"civilized"""" western sensibility"""" terms?

0,"Actually it was explained if you had read some other MSM. After the attorney general met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac in an aircraft she recused herself and assigned the case to FBI director Comey.   Since Clinton's team destroyed the servers, Comey's team tried their best to recreate Hillary's emails but they could not be sure they had all of  Hillary's work emails.  Therefore Comey promised Congress he would inform them if they discovered any other emails.  In a separate case it came to light that Hillary's trusted assistant had sent emails on another device that the FBI was unaware of and so Comey was obligated by his promise to inform congress.  What you and others do not recognize, Hillary did not trust government staff and left office without leaving access or a record of her government emails which she was required to do by law.  The fiasco was entirely due to Bill and Hillary and not Comey.  It is also sad that Hillary ignores the truth regarding the email controversy.

1,"Ontario's debt is about the same as Greece's.  While there are differences, the commonality is that they are both unsustainable.  Wild unrestrained and corrupt spending on public sector unions distorts the market and leads to huge negative consequences for everyone including the teachers and other public sector unions who have not experienced any austerity in the past decade.  Wynne and the lieberals are corrupt hypocrites.  It's like taking in a wild animal at birth, taking away all of their ability to survive and creating a dependency, then suddenly releasing them into the wild a few years later.  We all know how that works out and wynne has been doing that suckering in all of these social justice warriors and public sector unions, but with the province near bankrupt, the reckoning is coming and these folks will be hit doubly hard.  Wynne and her kids, they'll be fine, they'll be working for these energy companies that have 20 year locked in contracts.

0,"Margaret Wente's comment is based on a common misunderstanding, unfortunately very common. The ethos of care is not subverted by the opportunity for the patient to choose assisted dying. Assisted dying is complementary to, and not contradictory to other kinds of care. At least the person in the hospice knows that if palliative care does not work for them, there is always an escape clause. And it is well known that palliative or hospice care is not a panacea. Intolerable suffering does still occur. Suggesting that hospice or palliative care is the answer for everyone is simply false. Margaret Wente should study how people die in hospice. Not always a pretty picture, Please, Margaret, read Julia Lawton's book """"The Dying Process: patients' experiences of palliative care""""  (an anthropological study of an English hospice). The problem is that Margaret Wente's position is just as (or more) dogmatic than those who support assisted dying, but do not demand it except for those who ask.

Getting farmers worried is just an attempt to distract everyone's attention from the real intent of the legislation.  Corporations are encouraged to retain earnings so that they can plow money back into the business itself.  Society's support for corporations is based on the idea that they will innovate and employ people.  Retirement planning and sprinkling of income to relatives not employed by the business are not the proper objectives of incorporation.  The government supplies instruments to all citizens for retirement planning.  And who in their right mind would expect tax advantages from giving money to their relatives?  It's absolutely preposterous.  I didn't vote for the Liberals in the last election, but I applaud their initiative in introducing these changes.

He went on to use Port Orchard as an example where their Council is trying to implement Code status as if it were some great improvement while the truth is that very recently a large majority of the business people there soundly rejected their City changing from second class status. The Council there is now attempting to ram it down their throats, essentially against the People's will. Sound familiar?

Because politically, you can’t give it away. So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you’re 21 years old, you start working and you’re paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you’re 70, you get a nice plan. Here’s something where you walk up and say, “I want my insurance.” It’s a very tough deal, but it is something that we’re doing a good job of.""""  Mentally and intellectually unfit to be president!

0,"It is difficult when a leader either directly or indirectly put up barriers that impede the free movement of products.  Alberta, has suffered such a fate with the leader of Canada.  A leader elected by the two most populated provinces in Canada.  This leader has places onourous restriction on the free movement of Alberta oil to market.  The result a more expensive oil , cutting into profits and making investment into Alberta oil less appealing.  Now a similar rate appears on the horizon for Quebec and Ontario.  Free movement of goods into key markets and likely more tariffs and administration awaits.  While expansion in Canada is possible, why incure the cost.  Even though free trade has helped all provinces, those with most value added will likely suffer the most.  This will be very frustrating, as despite best efforts and truth you gave no power.

When conservatives moan about the resistance to some speakers and some form of speech (usually speech that is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or ableist) what they're really saying is, """"We used to be able to say whatever we wanted without anyone complaining, and now they are.""""  As traditionally oppressed/silenced groups grow in power and voice, they are increasingly pointing out the damage done to them when people support systems that oppress them. They're standing up for themselves. They're arguing. They're educating. They're engaging in free speech, themselves.  And if you dislike the fact that people other than you have the right to speak, you're not in favour of free speech.

Yes, it was not done with the full set of King's rules applied. However, being that one of the candidates would not go in front of the camera to answer these questions, you have to base your material off of what you got - and for both of them, there was a wealth of it by the time these pieces came out.  For Civil Beat, I am glad that they are able to do these innovative tactics to at least let the public know what the points are. Otherwise, as many have criticized CB being in this whole campaign - being totally biased toward Caldwell at the expense of Djou - at least this showed that they tried to get balance. Now in the future, it would behoove candidates to probably accept a invite and speak, lest they be presented in the way Caldwell was....subtle messaging.

That dog won't hunt: the play-calling, Freeman and Benoit repeated belly-plays on first-down though no success was there to be found, was predictable and stubborn. Ramming one's head repeatedly into a brick-wall has little impact on the wall. Even Taggart should have a headache by now. Second, the Cougar down D linemen were shifting after they saw the Oregon alignment: why didn't Willie adjust, over a SIXTY-minute period, to have the center immediately snap the ball?

But just as communism had evil outcomes despite good intentions, so capitalism has had good outcomes despite evil intentions. The question of whether there were more good than evil is more subjective. I think there wasn't. Many think there was. But their insistence on citing as best outcomes of capitalism things for which the credit actually belong to endeavors independent of economics (such as scientific advances which have reduced world hunger) is strong evidence that the the real good outcomes are not all that impressive. Truly successful endeavors have no need to take credit for the achievements of others.  Capitalism works great as long as no business is ever allowed to get big enough that the owner is no longer part of and dependant on the community in which it operates. No businessman would dump toxins in his own drinking water. Nobody exploits their friends, family and neighbors.

(That more or less would require to finish the tiny sample!) 2) If indeed one is NOT supposed to finish the sample, then the proper and rule observing *server should* whisk it away, no? 3) The few truly cases where such a process (limiting the sample/sip) IMHO would apply is for perhaps rare wines or expensive ones, so that each drop is savored and enjoyed by all (i.e. more than 1 person).... 4) Some of the wiser servers I have had the good fortune to be in company with, usually when they get the earliest nod of approval will top up the sample glass with the proper pour amount, thus ensuring that no need to finish the sample!

0,"Obviously you're not an economist. Just because the nominal wage, which is what you're referring to, increases does not guarantee that the real wage, the wage after prices have fully adjusted, will increase. The reason for this is that businesses need a way to compensate for the loss in profit. There are two ways they can fix this.  First, businesses can increase their prices, which will only decrease the consumer's/worker's purchasing power, or the ability to afford a certain amount of goods. Thus, making them worse off.  Second, businesses can lay off workers and replace them with cheaper technology that can do the same job.  So to go back to your example, the worker making 16k would make more but not be able to afford as much stuff or lose their job and make 0K.  Bottom line, the government should not have the authority to take away personal freedoms such as freedom on religion as they did in medieval Catholic Europe or economic freedoms in the name of """"social justice""""

This would include instances such as applying for a passport, oath of citizenship, boarding an aircraft, requirements for presenting oneself and identification in any form, etc., etc.  While Butt has acknowledged that requirement for this type of removal is wholly reasonable, he has gone further and suggested that at a public library or on a bus, for example, this could require keeping the face continuously uncovered.    This is ridiculous and I am sure was never the intent of the Quebec legislation.   He is exaggerating his lawyerly his mind here beyond the intent of the law and beyond his depth.

Alas the bishops parry on in science and politics, with their opposition to social issues favored by the vast majority of the faithful;  contraception, civil unions, stem cell research,  ordaining women, divorced and remarried Catholics receiving communion.  The list then goes on to science, with the church accepting beliefs as truths, from the first centuries, over what science knows to be alternative facts, over the relativity of quantum mechanics by accepting a static world of ancient myth and superstition.   While the bishops insist on improvidence, their mingling in science and politics, becomes fiction.

Monetary policy is the domain of the independent Federal Reserve which kept interest rates at near zero for eight years. That made the slowest and lowest US economic recovery possible. The """"independent"""" charts for this are all over the Internet, ignore anything published by Obama's budget office, it is propaganda.  The US government (POTUS + Congress) increased spending and the deficit by $10 Trillion dollars over 8 years. Deficit spending is just GDP borrowed from the future, and this borrowing did not have the desired multiplier effect on the real economy.

The Chargers capitalized on a fluky interception to get back in the game (FYI - no pass interference behind the line of scrimmage), and showed that they get paid to play too.  The Broncos defense was missing two projected starters(Ray, Crick), and still managed to put in an impressive showing. Offensively, solid production provided multiple scoring opportunities.

0,"I do.  The one of the reasons addiction is increasing is because it has now being described as a  medical problem.  There is however no pathology involved with addiction, it is not like a disease such as cancer or diabetes.  When someone uses these drugs,  over time, the natural serotonin release is halted or stalled, and the user therefore needs more and more of the drug to create the desired effect.  """"Addictive personalities"""" are somewhat of a misnomer, almost all of us have the capability to become addicted to narcotics.  Why some do and some do not become addicted is still not known, but in the meantime calling addictions simply a disease is disempowering to those that are addicted.  Extensive therapy is needed, replacing destructive behaviours with Healthy behaviours is imperative.  Personal accountability is important.  It is this """"disease"""" attitude that has increased addictions, and the criminal element that fuels it.   But, the solution is not to legalize """"recreational"""" drugs

They don't do what they do for our health or the good of the world. It's all for shareholder profit. Even Monsanto's new cheery support for monarchs is all designed for profits.

That cannot be the case.  All that does is encourage parent-of-young-kid illegal immigration.  So, the unfortunate reality would be that THOSE types of immigrants would have to be dealt with summarily, with no or less recourse, to avoid a flood of young kid illegal immigration (with accompanying adults) in likely mistaken hopes of achieving Dreamer status for the kids.

That had a dampening effect on a lot of theologians both lay and religious.  All one has to do is look at the abuse Pope Francis has taken over AL and even the hint that divorced Catholics without annulments can receive Communion.  There is a super need on the uber right for truth to be unchanging truth even when enforcement of that truth becomes a counter sign to charity and a bludgeon of anger rather than a sacramental sign of love.  In my faith journey love trumps truth because truth is relative in a Universe based in quantum relativity.  Even Jesus defined God as Love, not truth.

Having family members in positions of power is a good start.  He has no idea how anything he wants to do affects his own country. He does know how to reduce his income taxes if his 'plan' were ever enacted. It won't! I wonder whether a lot of you would think differently if we had a Trump in Canada. You might want to read, for example, the Washington Post to find out what American bloggers have to say.  But then it is their country and they have to live with the fallout.

The city also should build lines on pre-existing heavy routes:  where is the Colo Blvd line?  Where is the Colfax train? Where is the Broadway train?  Where's the Speer Blvd. Line?  These kinds of main town trains are necessary to make a feeder system work well.  They need to run on the same street with the cars, like they do in many European cities, and just go!

Second, they'd have to suffer the humiliation of comparisons between their embarrassing lack of sellout crowds with the massive support and crowds (in and outside of the arena) that the Leafs enjoy.

If Denver stopped paying to subsidIze your lifestyle and started building our city to support our own citizens instead of suburban commuters you guys would be screwed. It’s only decades of inertia which has kept this from happening and every tiny move we make, like the bike lane on Broadway, is met with people crying foul because they know that they’re gonna be in trouble if the city ever changes course to support locals and leaves them to their own devices.

It goes back to 1997 where the Williams team won the championship in the controversial last race of the year. Amongst the controversies was what amounted to wire tapping by the Ferrari team - a practice that had long been suspected but which was now confirmed.  It was put to one of the Williams engineers that they might have done the same if the boot were on the other foot. He said no, Sir Frank Williams calls the team management in at the start of every season and tells them what his team will not do. It doesn't matter if others do it and prosper, the Williams team does not do these things.  That's leadership.  Too often these days - in business and in politics - leadership is reactive. They don't draw a pre-emptive line, they react when something happens and try to talk their way out of it.

The increases will lead to people decreasing their electricity use, (elasticity of demand)  which will mean that prices will increase more, because there will be less sold and Hydro will still have to pay off their debt.  Export sales are flat at best so we can't count on the US to pay for it, and it might be cheaper for Alberta to import from the US or from other provinces than BC if they don't create their own power. As it is, the BC government takes a """"dividend"""" from BC Hydro, which may or may not continue, but those funds will also have to come from somewhere - which means from us taxpayers.

Right wing populist movements, be in it Poland or the US, are at their core a rejection of the multicultural as the """"end game"""" of protected individual rights in favour of identity politics that pits group against group, with winner takes all (tyranny of the majority) as the alternative end game (read objective) of the dominant group. As someone has already reminded you, Christianity is very much on the side of multiculturalism: """"There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor free; nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.""""

0,"When my grand-daughter was about a year old, my wife and I took her on a walk (in a stroller) from the river to Spencer's butte. Once there, my wife put her in a front carrier and we headed up the trail. Not very far in, we encountered an unleashed dog that was very interested in my grand-daughter, and not in a good way. As the owners casually called for their dog, I stepped between it and its intended victims. When it persisted, I gave it a small taste of boot.  Oh, the screams of horror from the two women who had loosed this dog upon us! They were absolutely certain that this was all my fault. Eventually, they put their dog on a leash and left. Personally, I thought I was quite restrained. My first inclination was to break the dogs snout, but I just bruised it in hopes that it would then go away.

0,"The way the Rockies have been playing since June 20th indicates either that the Rockies are not as good as they were for the first (nearly) three months of the season---or they are not as bad as they have been for the last two months of the season. I like to believe it is a little of both.  I am starting to lose hope that CarGo will break out of his prolonged slump---though he keeps giving flashes of doing so. If he can, I sense that he would go on a mammoth tear of epic proportions. Last night he came through. Yes, it was only a sac fly---but it was a good at bat in a critical situation with a hard-hit ball sent deep.  Story is getting hot. He sees a lot of pitches per at bat and will only get better.  The Rockies bullpen was not as good as it was the first three months, but it also isn't as bad as it was the last two months. I think the Rockies regroup, get hot again at the right time, and end up with 95 wins and will be hot for the playoffs.

He's consistently and aggressively fought for working Oregonians like no other person in politics, including going after paycheck cheats.  It also seems silly for the RG to support having someone for statewide office from a party that is in its death-throws and well on its way to becoming a South-only party.

There is more force, threats & intimidation involved in its collection & my financial privacy is invaded. Politicians can buy votes by promising those who vote for him government money & programs that the other guy has to pay for. It is a tax for a collectivist society. Marx & Engels made the income tax the 2nd plank of their “Communist Manifesto”. Our Founding Fathers were champions of individual liberty & did not support a direct tax on individuals. They favored tariffs, which are a consumption tax. A sales tax is also a consumption tax. I would support a flat sales tax where all citizens where subject to pay. I would support it after the budget was cut further across the board. Except in the departments needed to protect people from other people. That is the basic fundamental purpose of government.

0,"Fraternite: I don't think you answered the RESP question either. You are assuming that the grandparents want to catch up. I read that the GPs want to move ahead. As per Rob's suggestion, the GPs can put $50,000 lifetime maximum into the RESP in year one, but then they forego the CESG for all remaining years.  If the GPs cared abour betting the maximum CESG, with a lifetime maximum CESG of $7,200, equivalent to contributions of $36,000, to maximize CESG the GPs should keep ($36,000 - $2,500) = $33,500 for future contributions.  So the GPs should contribute ($50,000 - $33,500)  = $16,500 this year, $2,500 next year, and plan on contributing $2,500 in January for the next 12 years and $1,000 for 2030. They could even buy an annuity in the name of the grandson that would make the future RESP payments. Income from the annuity would be small, so attribution back to the GPs insignificant.

And this is why unions are needed. So for the anti-union lemmings the solution is not about the unions, the solution lies in employers and corporations not engaging in these practices which makes unions necessary. You want less unions?  Go after the employers and corporations.

Once Mr. Meese was indicted for crimes, he loudly proclaimed that he was innocent until proven guilty and should be afforded the best of treatment. Sadly, that's just the way many people are wired.  In spite of all this, I rather like the system of dumping rubbish into a pit.

0,"Election Fraud is illegal interference with the election process. Voter fraud is individual voters misrepresenting who they are. When organized (conspiratorial), it's called electoral fraud. Knowing the difference is important. Election fraud is a far more serious and real threat than individual voter fraud. It is less about what happens in the polling booth and more about removing the right to vote through disenfranchisement (voter suppression, etc.), intimidation, vote buying, misinformation, misleading or confusing ballots, destruction or loss of ballots, restricting  or otherwise making it more difficult to access polling places (not enough voting machines, limiting hours of operation or parking), and other such tactics. It doesn't seem likely that many people would take the chance to vote illegally on their own with so much to lose and virtually nothing to gain. If they were coerced or had something of substance to gain, that would be election fraud (or possibly, electoral fraud).

Many believe it would be constitutional because it does NOT impose a qualification over and above the federal government, but merely requires the provision readily and easily providable information. The Supreme Court case that is always cited, """"U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton"""" DID add an actual qualification to be on the ballot: candidates could not have served more than three or more terms in Congress. The release of tax returns makes no requirement as to what the returns show; that judgement would be up to the individual voter. Not surprisingly, conservative-leaning experts believe this would still be unconstitutional and a liberal-leaning experts believe it would be perfectly constitutional. We may get to see what the Supreme Court thinks at some point.

0,"Sher, are you saying that a country should not have the right to determine who they admit in?  I don't see many people flooding to India, and obviously you wanted out (or perhaps your parents), but if people were flooding there would it be universal support for their arrival from all Indian's, even if that meant they would become the minority?   Can people have concerns that accepting too many people from countries that after hundreds of years are still unable to organize themselves into a utilitarian manner, might not be the best unless it is done very slowly?  Are we within our rights as a nation to tell people from India to slow down on the procreation levels, or we will stop accepting families greater than three(kids)?  Why did you emigrate?  What made you turn your back on your birth country (or your parents)?   Was it not for a better society that could offer you more (so therefore self interest)?  You are a smart guy so I am glad you are here, but curious as to your thoughts.

0,"No, Dave, that's just not how it works.  The State of Hawai'i transferred the Kaka'ako parcel in exchange for $200+ million it owed to OHA.  If selling the property was that simple, then the State could have sold the land any time they had wished and transferred the proceeds to OHA.  If you actually followed the negotiations (and the news at the time), instead of making up fake news of your own, you would have known that OHA had asked for $200+ million and not the near-equivalent in land.  Land was ultimately part of the exchange because the State couldn't pony-up the $200+ million.  So, again, Dave, you're absolutely wrong.

They are done by bullies and people that are misfits in the general population, or that fall in line to the destructive behaviour. The military is not where any young person should be as they are not looked after to repair the mental and physical toll to them or their families. There are true, brave, honourable people that do serve though. Some of them are transgendered but believe in cohesion, discipline and camaraderie.  It is the bigots and bullies that are the destructive ones.

Dunleavy seems to be a one-man marching band (with only the possible inclusion of Sen Hughes).  How can the Governor of Alaska unite, rather than divide the very group the Governor must work with to accomplish anything? The continual fighting and apparent bickering is the cause for gridlock, and while gridlock is often better than a worse resolution, if that's your long-term strategy, then you have no business attempting to be the leader of state government.  Think of it like this: would you hire a General Manager for your company that no one wanted to work for? Or one that customers and contractors didn't want to do business with? Of course not. You'd want one with a proven track record of success; of finding ways to getting positive things accomplished.  Sorry Senator Dunleavy; this isn't you

0,"Are you channeling St. John Paul II?  He never met a lay person he didn't regard as a second class Catholic.  Benedict XVI fell right in step with his own desires to be the chief theologian so he could punish those who disagreed with him or were better.  There is a little problem with their moves to keep the laity in the pews: a document that says differently from a Church Council, no less, which elevates the laity to a far higher purpose, jut in time for the erosion and collapse of magisterial authoritarianism.  Pope Francis knows of it, and regards it with seriousness, yet is slow to push its full expression in the face of so many resistant bishops to the sharing of influence and power.  So we lose so many active and practicing (of the faith) Catholics and have the massive reductions in vocations of all kinds as we do Regression never works in the long run, and particularly not in the Church on a pilgrimage to meet Christ at the end of time.  Our previous two popes were very wrong.

If the neighbors who are finding they are feeling anger where they could be feeling compassion, maybe they, and others, will join the campaign to create a tax on the rich.  Three city council members are behind the campaign.  So far it entails taxing earnings over $200,000 per year, for an individual and $250,000 per year for a couple at a rate of 1.5%.  That is a small amount and adds a great deal to social services that are now missing.  Roosevelt, in 1944, proposed to Congress taxing income over $400,000 in today's terms at 100%.  Jeremy Corbyn of England this past year also proposed that tax. Melenchon, running for president in France, a contender now, is also running with that in his platform.  Both are using figures and rate comparable to Roosevelt's.  Our far more modest one is to begin in Seattle and our city prosecutor is taking it seriously.

0,"Amazingly inconsistent and incoherent - Firsts the premise: health care providers have too much power relative to the payer. So, get ready for once the greatest inversion of logic ever, you need more payers so the providers can bill ever more payers thus competing with each other to see who can increase billing the most! Competition would be increasing the number of providers, possibly through immigration or reduced stringency of licensure which restricts the availability of providers. And thus the increased supply would drive the price down at least for the same demand (ceteris paribus which in reality never happens anyway). The trouble with incoherent ideology is that it shoots itself in its own self-professed foot just to avoid the cognitive dissonance from its own fallacy. This example, however, is one the most extremely incoherent, Trumping most, so to speak.

Set your nation's health insurance premiums of the cost of the healthcare for the 90% who use little and pay directly for the 10% who use the most.

So if a private school has per pupil funding through donations, tuition, and vouchers of say $25k, every public school in the state would receive $25k per pupil.

There is probably as much smoke in Trump's claim as there is in the media/DNC inspired  Russian matter.  Take the state of California. They have the most liberal voter registration in the nation. Since 2015 you are automatically registered to vote when you get or renew your drivers license.  Now, that doesn't sound too bad on the surface, until you 'investigate' a little further.  Since 2013 people immigrating illegally have been  able to legally obtain a drivers license.  In all fairness to the state of CA they do claim that they encourage people to 'opt out' if  they are not here legally, or are not actually a citizen. I believe the President has a valid concern of possible  fraud

0,"Watching the German reaction at rather closer quarters than most commentators here (whether they be in Toronto or St. Petersburg), I am impressed by the calm way Germans have responded to the Berlin tragedy. While the extremists may gain a few votes, I believe that reason will prevail. As pointed out elsewhere by Gwynne Dyer, the number of casualties from terrorist attacks is very small compared with the cumulative daily toll from traffic accidents, to which one can add the """"usual"""" crimes occurring in any sizable country. Terrorists want, and generally get, extreme over-reaction, yet the probability of being a victim of terror is very small (which is not to dismiss the terrible pain of those affected). Germany has learned the terrible cost of unwarranted action against other groups and nations. It is tragic that the US did not do so after  9/11 and its aftermath, and now Trump threatens to do worse, a pawn in the geopolitical games of Putin and the Sunni/Shia division.

0,"Wikipedia offers a list of cardinals who were excommunicated.  You're right -- history suggests that there have been many instances of conflicts between cardinals and the pope, usually not the pope who made them cardinal, but a successor.  Cardinals (especially in the curia) opposing the pope, or attempting to control or undermine him, is nothing new or particularly shocking. However, the incident with the Knights involves a situation in which Burke not only disagreed with the pope (Burke is entitled to his opinion), but misrepresented the pope in a situation where it was Burke's job to represent faithfully the pope's wishes -- whether or not he agreed with the pope. If the pope decides to impose some sort of discipline on Burke, it will not be due to Burke's disagreement but to his malfeasance.

There were many smart people who said real estate could never go down nationwide and then it did.  There were many smart people saying Detroit could never go bankrupt and then it did.  There were even people saying Trump would never be president just last week....  Failing a large source of new funding, what will states like Oregon do when they eventually run out of money other than declare bankruptcy to restructure (i.e. reduce) their debt?  I know it's never happened before but these are strange times and to pretend it can never happen is irresponsible to those who pay taxes and to those whose benefits are on the line.

Worldwide national investigations of Roman Catholic Church policies will hopefully drive the Vatican to recognize its need for a non-partisan investigation before its credibility falls to zero.

The Hierarchy were the dominant power, in an emerging young nation and strongly influenced all new legislation with moral implications.""""

Nothing new is created and the endless CTV programming ads are just stupid clips from the shows.  Then they end up over-playing the ads and not cutting bak to the broadcast in time.  And they force-feed us Sports Centre drivel when I want to be watching the Super Bowl coverage.

It's a fait accompli, but a just one that reflects the reality on the ground. The Globe's editors should find a better example over which to bemoan a change of sovereignty.

Provide both sides of the story, not just the one you want to be told 4.  Provide sources so we know that your are not just making it up 5.  Treat the people you cover and interview with respect 6.  Check your bias at the door  If I can read an article by you and I can't tell whether you are siding one way or the other or I can't tell whether you are a conservative or a liberal and I can feel confident that you reported the truth.  But don't tell use your sob story about all the """"fake news"""" out there.  Get your own house in order.  If you do that then people might actually believe what you have to say and then you are at least a one step distance away from the real Fake News.

Here in Canada we vote for our MPs and if any of them happen to be of Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, French, Ukrainian, Somalian, Hindu, Jewish, or even, Russian heritage and so on that is JUST FINE. We do our best to elect reasonable, intelligent, hard-working and honest people to the House of Commons and they, in turn, reflect the views and concerns of their constituents while making the decisions they are elected to, based on their own judgements. That works. I know it's different in 'Mother Russia' but no one in the world wants to go to live there, and many of those born there seem to prefer coming to places like the good old USA or Canada, I wonder why.

0,"Onto Medical Malpractice and health care.  A large number of Medical Malpractice lawsuits are settled, paid out, before court. The reason is simple-money. As in all other lawsuits, often it is much cheaper to pay out on a bogus claim than the costs of clearing ones name in court. Solid cases are different, but fairly rare.  If-big if-'we' really wanted to address healthcare costs, one way is to limit the payouts-no different than Work Comp does, and even like this """"all states should be auto no-fault/PIP. Personal injury and auto accident injury claims."""" And the suing party, if they lose, would owe all costs associated with their lawsuit-courts, and defending sides legal fees.  If we did that, it would give pause to 'ambulance chasing' lawyers and the party suing. Before suing!  The High Costs of Medical Malpractice Insurance is one very large factor in the cost of our health insurance. It is passed to the paying consumer, just as store thefts are.  But that is/was ignored.

Stewart’s article doesn’t break out the tax burden in dollar terms – just percentages i.e. the bottom 20% pay 11% of their income on GET, the next 20% pay 8.5%, and the next pay 6.5%.  Let’s just average it at 10% across those 3 groups and, to be extra generous, let’s say the average income across those groups is $50,000.  The total amount the GET rail surcharge costs those families is $555 p.a.  The state currently skims $30 million a year from O‘ahu taxpayers.  If that money were rebated to completely compensate the cost of the rail tax surcharge the state could make whole about 54,000 of the poorest families on the island – or about 200,000 people.  In reality the rebate could touch a considerably larger number of people. The tax regressivity argument is an excuse for legislators to beat their chests.

Instead, we incentivized real estate speculators and developers and we incentivized consumers to borrow too much and in less than 10 years we created a real estate bubble which made housing unaffordable for most Canadians.  Now with even a pathetic increase of 25 points the real beneficiaries of low rates are unhappy. We need to get back to basics and acknowledge the simple truth that borrowed money has to be paid back and growth built on speculation is no growth at all.

Despite losing in a lawsuit brought by the Register Guard to disclose most of this contract (and paying $70,000 for the paper's legal fees), EWEB still is not required to tell ratepayers how much they are paying Seneca for power.  We should consider EWEB's market calls to be a warning that the electricity market will probably do exactly the opposite of what they think: natural gas prices will spike, electricity demand will rise, and EWEB will regret selling the wind farm.

It would be great if The World University Rankings expanded their TEF model beyond UK institutions. The Macleans rankings of undergraduate programs doesn't even take teaching effectiveness into account. At best the only measure currently available that may have some correlation with effectiveness is class size and student/teacher ratio.  The other issue I think is that universities and colleges have expanded beyond their original mandates. You have universities offering vocational programs and colleges now offering 4 year Bachelor degrees. I think universities should be forced to scale back their programs to those that are pre-professional/professional and theoretical. All the more applied programs should be shifted back to the colleges. If the colleges want to offer 4 year programs that's fine but they shouldn't be able to call them Bachelor's degrees.

A big city hospital can pull in close to half a billion dollars a year in patient care revenue. That is tax money from taxpayers for health care there. Over the course of a decade, you are looking at billions of dollars in operating expenses.  And so some rich man's 75 million donation is a drop in the bucket, and that is not even mentioning any tax benefit he might get for the donation.

Civil Comments seemed like a decent idea at first, but it's being exposed as having fatal flaws that probably can't be fixed.  There's always going to be lots of people that get annoyed by having to screen posts they have no interest in (nor followed the context of the discussion, nor have the patience to read it all).  As such, many posts just get a default """"Yes"""" click.  Which means even the ones that are truly uncivil are still going to make it through, just from people reposting them over and over until they find enough no-look Yes's.  Now that people are figuring out that loophole, whatever faith there may have been in the system to weed out uncivil comments is being eroded.

In that cartoon Sir John is standing in the presence of extremely impoverished, starving First Nations people. He has a bag of money that is clearly budgeted for those starving people and he is handing it to a fat-cat business-corporate-industry person behind his back.  That cartoon speaks volumes.

0,"Ms. Ford, I agree. I have a granddaughter on a high school team here in Anchorage. As a serious player (MVP) she would simply wear longer shorts in the appropriate color and go right on playing as if her life depended on the game but she would definitely not give up the sport.  She gets frustrated with any player who """"Just goofs off."""" Her brother plays basketball, football, baseball and works out at """"the club"""". Dad coaches football and basketball and refs, and the littlest girl is a black belt in karate at 8 years of age and rides a unicycle. But says she wants a motorcycle. Others need to get with it, those shorty-outfits went out of style back in the early 90s, I believe. Even the boys' basketball shorts come down to their knees. Poor mama is the victim: you have no idea how much time she spends in the car. She took up knitting... Grandpa and grandma spend a lot of time sitting on bleachers and cheering.

0,"As noted by residenttaxpayer notes, Germany provides ample examples of meaningful apologies, negotiating agreements with Israel. rebuilding the destroyed Jewish and other persecuted communities, actively suppressing any resurgence of Nazi symbolism and activity, etc.. Any visitor to Munich, Berlin, Bonn can readily appreciate the feeling of national regret and the continuous effort to avoid repeating the past. Japan has been asked multiple times by China, Korea and other countries to make similar national gestures and has steadfastly refused to do so. And unlike Germany, which educates children about the Nazi regime,  Japan has rewritten history and has been teaching their children that Japan was more victim than aggressor during WWII.  So no, individuals do not need to be generating letters to consulates and pleas to the Japanese government; the issue is far beyond this level.

You shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty. 3.

You shall not engage in outside activities that conflict with your official Government duties and responsibilities.

The State capture issue and firing of our internationally respected finance minister means that investment funding from the international community does not come here. And unlike the Asian countries, we do not have what it takes to pull ourselves up by our own boot-straps. We are a nation more interested in our rights than in our obligations and more interested in what our country can do for us, not in what we can do for our country. This is the reality of South Africa, sadly!

Then add to that fact that many of the illnesses clogging up and increasing costs to the system are lifestyle related chronic illnesses that could be largely prevented or reversed by actually following health care providers direction.  Dialysis used to be mainly for those with kidney disease but a 300% increase in kidney failure due to uncontrolled type II diabetes is making a mess of the system.

Certainly there had to be some racist tension for the only black guy in the woods,  except for a high climber/hook tender in Sweet Home, last name James.  Slats Gill's problem was that our Jim Crow South,  and wide spread discrimination elsewhere,   disallowed black players from staying in the  same hotel as white teammates. Gill  wouldn't do that to  players.  He  actively tried to recruit more than one black player,  and actually had black players before UNC or Duke.  He was coaching in transition times.    The guy cared about  all players,  and recruited in Oregon and Washington.  It was not easy for a kid of any color to get from Southern California to Corvallis,  with 1950s transportation  costs and time the limiting factors.   Think about it;  I-5 and cheap  air travel were  deciding factors in bringing black athletes to OSU.

A provider can get sued for anything, no matter how frivolous the charges.   They have to pay for legal counsel (either through direct payment or through the cost of malpractice insurance) even to get a baseless lawsuit thrown out.  Option:  Give physicians immunity from lawsuits involving uncompensated care (except for gross negligence).  Next:  A doctor who treats someone for free incurs opportunity costs (could have been seeing a paying patient during that same time).  Option: Allow providers to right off a percentage of uncompensated care against their taxable income.  Let them do that and suddenly you have fee for service doctors opening their doors to many more folks. The loss of income tax for those docs will be little vs tax dollar savings from less of a need for government funded insurance.

For example, some states require that a landlord accept rent payments in cash. Many states require that a private impound lot accept cash payments by an owner seeking the release of a motor vehicle. When acceptance of a cash payment is required by state law, the state will often impose a penalty or other consequence on a business that refuses to accept cash. For example, in California a landlord's refusal to accept cash payment of rent may cause the payment to be deemed excused.""""

0,"Part 3  Feeling very dissatisfied with how the entire school had been handling it, I forwarded the emails I had with Principal Fernandez to the Head of Special Education Vice Superintendent Suzanne Mulcahy.  I expected her to help and hold people accountable.  Instead she sent me an email stating that I was being """"threatening"""" and """"out of line"""".  I was shocked, saddened, but at the same time it gave me hope for greater change.  The email was evidence of a high level coverup and begged the question what else is being swept under the rug.  I knew I had to go public so this could be investigated.  I immediately contacted Civil Beat upon receiving the email.  Shortly after I was suspended.  A month later I was banned from working at any Hawaii DOE sites indefinitely.  I spent 5 years earning half a living wage (12K) so I could be credentialed and be promoted to a position paying 4-5 times more money.  I struggled and went without so I could make this my career and they all robbed me.

It's the only incorporated town in Sierra County, the state's second smallest. It hasn't voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 and has long had a republican congressman, state senator and state assembly member. It lost a lumber mill, the town's only employer.  What dangerous criminals are being let out of prison because the state can't afford to pay the bills?  Name one. Just one. In fact, the prison population went up thanks to the Republican """"three strikes"""" law, implemented by backwater D.A.'s like Kern County Republican Ed Jagels who sent 35 innocent people to prison for nonexistent child abuse crimes, and imprisoned a guy who stole $1 in donuts for 25 years.

It was this business of celebrating and thanking a deity for a pretty rainbow over Knysna when there had been no rain, and fires are still burning all around and in the nature reserve. The tree roots are on fire and the fires are slow, but still deadly. You cant get to them to put them out and the forest has been low priority during this disaster. Its people and property first,- environment last. That's how it is in fire disasters and also in normal life, and probably why we are all burned now. Alien vegetation, slow burning fires- left unattended in forest from other fires in past- all got us where we are today. Oh and also social problems- the income gap here is enormous- that could be why we have young children lighting fires- as they did in December last year- just for the fun of it.

There was a Military Police opening in Alaska, and I came here rather than going to Vietnam. I often feel guilty about not sharing the risks with my fellows who served in-country; but on the other hand, I sleep soundly every night, un-tormented by nightmares. I also knew several who died there.  My sister's boyfriend Don, killed by friendly artillery fire.  My college classmate John, murdered by a Claymore booby-trap while performing locker inspection on his first day in-country; it was intended for his CO, investigating drug dealing.  Al, my best friend at my first post, died in what I had understood for years was the bombing of a bowling tournament in Saigon (he was in the AG Corps) -- only to learn recently that Al died by suicide.

Would you not agree that CNN would not have been so hasty to fire Jeffrey Lord had they not had faith that a """"typical"""" CNN viewer would - with nary a thought - swallow an absolutist explanation that ANY use of """"Sieg Heil"""" is indefensible?  The salient issue isn't something so limited as what CNN as an employer can or can't do to an employee.  It has to do with what an influential media entity thinks its viewership will accept as reasonable and fair.  I mentioned the standing of the Nazi salute in today's Germany to demonstrate (inadequately as it now seems) how a reasonable, educated, and perhaps contrite people view the permissible use of language, even one with a tainted history.  I'm most disturbed at CNN because on the face of it, it promotes and perhaps rewards sloppy, absolutist and uncritical thinking, especially with its American viewing audience.  Absolutist thinking should worry you too.

It is so easy to undo the work of others, but we're still waiting to see if Trump can do any of the heavy lifting involved in actually doing something as opposed to undoing it.  In this case Trump is keeping a campaign promise that no reasonable candidate would have made, to sad people who are grossly misinformed about the world around them. Trump's supporters try to emphasize the costs of doing something as being prohibitive, but the rest of Americans, and the wiser world, know that the real costs lie in inaction.

Moreover, Pence has gone all-in in defense of a president whom he knows is corrupt, incompetent and unstable; he's gone so far in, and so often, that Trump's stench is now attached to Pence. Here's Pence in the Rose Garden this afternoon: """"It’s the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who is fighting every day to make America great again."""" While we know that Trump insists on this drivel from his underlings, Pence's willingness to grovel in that way, his lack of self-respect, damages his own credibility. He will succeed to the presidency in a weakened position. However, he will be eligible to run for two terms of his own.

0,"The ultimate argument for this new power granted the PBO to cost political party platforms came midway in the 2015 campaign.  A Halifax TV news reporter interviewing Liberal leader Justin Trudeau had the temerity to ask Mr. Trudeau what the cost of the his party's platform would be.   Trudeau blew him off by explaining he was too busy talking with Canadians to add up the costs of the platform and told the reporter if he was that interested he could always get out his calculator and add up the numbers himself.  Had this cavalier response had been delivered by Harper or even Mulcair it would have been all over the media but since it was made by media darling Trudeau, it was quickly buried.  The casual way in which too many political leaders regard election platform costs (and subsequent budgets) leads to a lack of information serious voters require to make a rational choice among platforms, parties and leaders.  This critical reform cannot come soon enough for concern Canadians!

Alot of companies use AK resources, but generate their revenue from locations and/or companies not formed in Alaska. Creating nexus to those companies would be difficult and tough to enforce.  Additionally, this is only a short term fix. A big issue is uncontrolled government spending. Government's budgets are built on a spend it or lose it mentality. Until that changes and governments put in a system to save and conserve money, no amount of taxes will ever be enough. If they have a surplus after balancing the budgets, then they increase budgets and take on new programs. The next year, surprise, there is a shortfall again.

Catering to the minority of 1/3 of the population who equate guns with the size of one's manhood is the shift that needs to be made. Keep in mind, that 1/3 concentrates its vote overwhelmingly on one party; that party is in total count a minority party. Going forward rather than controlling elections these people become givens to be written off with no further thought after noting the fixed size of their presence.

The Rox are 4-6 in their last ten games, it just so happens they won the first four. This isn't the first 4-6 stretch of the season and it won't be the last. This team won seven in a row and then six in a row just a couple weeks ago; with as young as the staff is there was going to be a correction, that's how baseball works.  Yankees are 3-7 Nats 5-5 Red Sox 5-5 Brewers 5-5 in their last ten respectively. All current playoff teams. Baseball is a marathon and everything evens out. If this becomes eight or nine games or losing 15 out of twenty then ok, freak out. But right now there is zero reason to panic; this is simply the ebb and flow of a baseball season.

And who had a surprise August meeting with Assange at the Ecuadorian assembly in London? “Putin’s favorite congressman” Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) who tried to get Trump to give Assange a pardon.

0,"Hey Fan, I think your point on the freedom to explore is critical to theologians' ability to do any real work.  For Christians, and Catholics, a good theologian might be somewhat analogous to what a cosmologist or advanced particle physicist is to science.  Like their counterparts, I see them as being able to take human knowledge or thought as far as it's ever gone, and then push the limit a little more.  It may take the rest of us a long time to catch up, but unless somebody is out there pushing the boundary, progress will not happen.  Sadly, I think the efforts of previous Popes, ESPECIALLY Benedict, who should have known better, have had a disastrous impact on the very nature of theology.  Yes, the man wrote a lot.  But his squelching theologians, sitting on them, etc., may well have the same kind of impact as society telling Mr. Higgs that he had to stop thinking of particle physics, and adhere to the Bohr model of the atom...  The church needs better, much better.

His autism dissociated him from the normal sense of right and wrong, and empathy that would have prevented him from slaughtering helpless children. The violent video games he played constantly reinforced that dissociation.  I don't know why the FBI felt the need to throw in the pedophile comments of a woman who never met Lanza in person. Or why the AP felt the need to write this article. Lanza's actions were the behavior of a disturbed man with organic brain disorder, fueled by exposure to violent stimuli and left unchecked by an incompetent mental health system and narcissistic parents.

Alternative lending is for people with an unrated credit score (immigrants) or perhaps a low credit score because of high credit usage, but also a high and proven cash flow, such as entrepreneurs.  You typically see higher rates of default with subprime of course, but the reason you don't with Home Capital is because they're simply not lending to subprime borrowers.

Consider also that arts funding represents such a minuscule part of the federal budget that zeroing it out would accomplish next to nothing in terms of national debt (the same goes for Meals on Wheels and other social programs on the block).  How about this: every time Trump goes to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend it costs taxpayers $3 million, so let's ask him to skip the golf course and just stay at the White House a few more weekends. If he does that six times this year, the savings to the taxpayer would equal Alaska's arts funding for the next twenty years!

Same baloney; no improvement in turnout.   All these policies have made it easier for illegal immigrants, dead people, and residents of other states to vote in Hawaii.

Again why bother with all of this criticism of a stock when you don't own it and it's certainly not on your buy list?  I'm also tired of providing undeniable facts that even when proven without doubt to be accurate are either ignored (rather I should say ignored today and then disputed again next week) when you can gain nothing even if you learned or were willing to learn from these facts and what can I gain? Maybe if this somehow helped you, then it might be time well spent. But it obviously does not.

0,"An Armalite AR15 semiautomatic assault rifle retrofitted with slidestock such as a Slide Fire modification, is simple to install, inexpensive and legally approved by the ATF since it is not regulated under the National Firearms Act or the Gun Control Act. With this legal mod, the AR15 has a rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute. A fully automatic M16-A2, which is built on the AR15 platform, has a maximum rate of fire of around 950 rounds per minute. Can you honestly say you can tell the difference between a modified semi-auto AR15 and a fully auto M16 just by the audio of the shooting? I sure can't. The crux of this issue is, if the gunman did use legally purchased and legally modified AR15s, pro-gun advocates will try to obscure this just as they did with the gunman who reputedly used modified AR15s in the Sandy Hook shooting, for they will fight to keep their weapon of choice legal despite its automatic capabilities which bears similarities with a fully automatic assault rifle.

He choose not to and we're still stuck in permanent war there. He allowed Clinton to talk him into waging war on Libya.  He has pushed the TPP trade deal that the left wing of his party does not want. Clinton supported that until Sanders started pushing back.

We should also worry about the decline in investigative journalism- why did it need the Globe and Mail to shine the light on the unsavoury aspects of the Vancouver Housing crisis while our politicians played deaf , dumb and blind.

Considering the government takes more than 50%, the real mortgage a couple in the 1% can afford is even smaller. The buyers who bring cash from abroad, paid no taxes or much less tax, so its an unequal playing field. If they don’t pay tax locally even after the purchase (say no employment/business income as most often the case), that means the locals need to step-up and pay even more tax By taxing foreigners differently, the authorities will even out the playing field.

Firearms made or imported into Canada are already amply marked with the serial number and with other information, typically the calibre, manufacturer name, and model.  Anyone familiar with firearms can easily tell where any particular example is from, in almost every case.   There is no reason for anyone to worry that guns made or imported into Canada are going to get out anonymously  into the international arms trade and wind up in (for example) Africa.   That concern is the supposed reason why these new marking Regs were suggested.

0,"Stand alone municipal/county ambulance services do very well, and tend to increase the level of care as they are better focused.  The reason fire departments are taking over privates is because after dumping them in the 80s they realize ambulance services actually generate revenue, while FDs will never be anything over than a money pit.  A necessary money pit, but a pit, regardless.  What the Anchorage FD never understands is it not a fire department that runs ambulance calls, it is an ambulance service that occasionally goes to a fire.  This is true in every municipality.  Public safety needs to be treated as if Anchorage is a county, not as if it is a small city.  This isn't to say Anchorage is not one of the best EMS services in the country, it is, but there is certainly room for improvement.  A few years ago I looked through their 5 year plan, there wasn't one mention of ambulance services, though more than 70% of their call volume, including for fire units, is EMS.

The dry beds you see in the distance is where the river use to be. I'm not sure how technically feasible it is to mine the other side and divert the river back to that area. I'm not even sure how profitable it is for the mining industry. Usually those gravel pits are supplemented with heavy metal recovery to make them profitable. I'm positive there is heavy metals there, but rather or not it's profitable is another thing. Short term create an erosion dike, long term mine and divert is what I say.

There is no equivalence between Perlow's action and the narrow actions that might be taken by other lawyers.  Patty Perlow was involved in the recorded confession matter.

I am always surprised at how willing lefties like you are to shovel over money to incompetent governments.

The same goes for monuments in Canada.   For example, we shouldn't tear down the monuments to Queen Victoria, but it might be worthwhile noting that she subjugated vast parts of the world to enhance the wealth of her own people.  Similar historical explanations should also be made regarding monuments that are currently attracting attention in Canada;  for example the horrors that Cornwallis inflicted on indigenous people and the fact that Begbie, although in some respects revered by some indigenous peoples, also sent six chiefs to to their deaths.

Outside of peak commuting times, RTD suffers from the perception, especially in suburban areas, that it's running """"empty"""" buses and """"wasting"""" taxpayer money. If buses don't come very frequently, many potential riders lose interest in using the system. And if the buses come frequently, and there are not many potential riders, for whatever reasons, the RTD board has responsibility to shift those resources to areas (and times) with more demand / actual use. It's the classic chicken-or-egg scenario (which comes first), combined with densities in most parts of the District that are too low to support frequent service. Add in riders who only use RTD to go special events or because they don't want to ride their bikes in the snow and you end up with the expectation that RTD """"should"""" run service that that individual won't be using, 99%+ of the time!

Because government takes people's taxes and gives newcomers a pot of money, and they get this pot of money even if there are no jobs. Government says yes master, creates more TFW programs and increases immigration, and gives out more and more taxpayers money.  The result? The supply side of the labour equation is ruined. Wages are suppressed while cost of living keeps climbing so the middle class declines, people have no disposable income so rely on credit, more competition for each job so rights and benefits are abandoned, poverty becomes more widespread, higher and higher unemployment, and the anger of the people that starts to show in violence, racism etc, It is the race to the bottom by our own government using our tax money to do it.

If he had one proposal to address things in at least some way, other than simply denying the science or even the concern, then he might garner some credibility.  Instead, he pursues the whacko internet perspective expertly propogated by polluting industry.  Could that mean our President is  a gullible whacko internet warrior at heart (he certainly doesn't """"produce"""" anything like the industrialists who really oppose the concept of climate change control do)?   Or, a greedy opportunist seeking, hoping or expecting to profit at the expense of the environment and those who must live in it?  Or, just gullible and greedy regardless of the impetuses, concerns  or consequences?

EXPOSED!  talk BEEG Europeans EXPOSED! and hasn't been paying it's fair share and according to our Commander in Chief some Countries owes us because they haven't paid their share. President Trump made it sound like the US been picking up the tab and wants payback or the US should PAY LESS to help defend NATO as most don't pay their fair share. Trump brings business logic to the WH, why does the US pay it's share while other countries don't and then the US gets blamed for thoughts of ditching NATO?  Now, who's ditching who? NATO Country's are ditching itself not funding it with what they agreed to! Nice way to put Donald! Keep up the good work

Why not write about racism that exists on both sides of the fence.  I'll come right out and say it........as a white person I've been discriminated against by LGBT crowd for being heterosexual.  I was in several fights when younger.  2 in Hawaii just for being white.  Once in Mexico for being white.  I was refused service by a black man because I was white and he didn't want to serve no honkey. I left the place.  Racism has existed and will exist.  You can't legislate peoples values.  What we don't have in America is institutional racism.  One mandated by the government.  So to the liberal crowd...quit your belly aching.  Really?

But, I believe it's very important to listen to the folks with actual data on the subject. There are a lot of disruptions and costs associated with changing the clocks twice a year.  Add to that the reality that we already enjoy daylight savings time for most of the year and standard time for only about 1/3 of it.  I'm sitting here in Calgary at 8 am, in the dark, ready to go to work; by 6 pm I'll be coming home and it will already be nearly dark.

Additionally, it doesn't sound like the 50 denials are going any further for prosecutions, let alone the 4,000 in total that were denied.  Again, perspective compared to previous years would be helpful.  The lack of prosecution won't deter a criminal from trying again.  It's like getting turned down at the grocery store when you try to buy beer while being underage.  """"Dang, it didn't work this time.  I'll try another store or another day......"""".  A law with no teeth does little to make changes in behavior.  How much cost was incurred for these 50 additional denials, and again compared to the total increased cost of tracking, checking, and processing the private sales in addition to the licensed firearms background checks.  I think  I would feel different if we're talking millions of cost compared to a minor cost.

Small victory for the planet.... but does no address the corrupt nature of the entire fishing industry that destroys tuna fish stocks, steals American jobs and traffic's in human labor all in the name of greed and to the detriment of the citizens of Hawaii.  To paraphrase Wm. Shakespeare... something is rotten in the State of Hawaii.  Smells like fish.

It is entirely the responsibiliy of the U.S. administration and it's ,military leaders. They are unwilling to compromise for the sake of their war games options. The option with a neutral, unified, demilitarized option is the only plausible one for longterm peace.  A similar agreement (without neutality though) has re-united Germany. Germany also has made it very clear, that it will not support any military operation.  The flaw of a demilitarized option for Korea is that the U.S. administration broke it's promise to Russia after German unifaction to never extend NATO beyond a unified eastern German border. Now NATO troops stand at the Russian border.  In a similar manner the Syria, Libyan, Irag, Georgia wars could have been avoided had the U.S. talked to Russia and offered them military bases in the Medittearean Sea instead of trying to strangle Russia.

In every way, he must accommodate her in every way through the Sacramental ministry of the priesthood….  The Diaconate, the same fervor. For without women, there’s no marriage. Without women, there’s no baptism, no blessing of the sick. The Sacramental life is dependent on the physical: new born life and creation that must be.

As it was, their obstruction caused Obama to water the ACA down a bit in order to demonstrate some appeasement to the Re-pubics and their constituents (BTW: that turned out to be a big mistake). If you remember, Dan, the Dems started working on healthcare in February 2009 and it was not signed into law until March 23, 2010 (more than a year later).

Again, Wentz was sacked three times, hit six times and pressured several other times. Sound familiar? Doesn't sound like perfect pass protection.  So let's recap. Wentz had a weak running game, was getting pressured, sacked, hit. Still lead his offense to 34 points and completed 68% of his passes with four TD's, and most importantly a Win.

Sure, the lack of supply and historical low interest rates are some of the root causes of the problem, but those issues cannot be tackled easily or in a timely manner. IMO, just a few measures will put the brakes on this runaway train of a market. 1) A foreign buyer tax of 15-20%, landed immigrants should not fall under the foreign buyer category. 2) A ‘flipper’ tax on any property bought and sold within a short period of time, ie 12 months. 3) A vacancy tax similar to the one implemented in Vancouver.

Owns his own business, pays his bills, loves his wife and kids ... and is terrified when a cop pulls into his rearview because cops seem determined to turn every traffic stop into a major felony and pissed off that he doesn't provide them with any evidence.

Look up long term returns on the likes of longrundata.com. I've owned all for many years although sold AW.UN a little while ago when its yield dropped below 5%. I will buy back in at a heartbeat if/when the great correction that everybody's predicting actually comes to fruition.  I would also suggest that you look at some of the higher yielding REITs with operations outside of Canada - DRG.UN, INO.UN (Europe) and HOT.UN, RUF.UN (U.S. - note that these two pay dividends in $US and there is withholding tax in a non-registered account not that that's a big deal to most investors as one can recoup via the Foreign Tax Credit).

Most of the gay priests I've known were very good at their jobs, some were just marking time until retirement and fed up with the church, but too old to get out and try to find some new way to make a living.

They wouldn't actually confront these """"issues"""" because they know most of it is simply garbage.  They'd get blustery about it and then when elected, move on to real issues, while angry voters waited for someone to solve the imaginary problems Fox invented. What Trump has done is take all these false, irrational conspiracy theories and turn them into election issues. By accepting these rants at face value, Trump has gained a following from the percentage of the public who accept everything on Fox as fact. While the GOP were content to play public paranoia for votes, Trump is actually building his policy based on that paranoia. That is his core audience.

There is no realistic level of physical activity that can come close to counteracting the junk food that most children have easy access to.  I don't know if the culprit is processed foods and the extinction of cooking skills, or if if it's the easy abundance of snack foods. But to me the issue is probably 90% to do with intake, not activity.  A 15 minute walk is a drop in the bucket. But it's better than nothing I suppose.

It bothers me that this country has been going through our national resources at an alarming rate and we can't support an accelerated population growth.  It bothers me that American employers clearly have much lower expectation for paying the immigrant what they deserve in pay/benefits, but get away with it because the illegal can't complain to officials without revealing their status.  It's only racist when somebody take a small sampling, lets say of Latino gang members, an applies those traits to all Latino people.   That's racist, it's blatant stereotyping and ends with discrimination.   Making accusation against and entire culture it ethnocentric at best, malicious intent at worst.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the """" wrong colors """", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.  In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger.  The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest.

In Israel, there are serious restrictions on where Palestinians are allowed to live; and people of different religions are not allowed to marry. Israel spends about three times as much on Jewish students as on Palestinian. It's easier for a Jew who has never visited Israel to become an Israeli citizen than it is for a Palestinian refugee to visit.

Answer: Financial markets expect higher corporate profits -- stemming from lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, and major infrastructure spending. Question: But what about Trump’s talk about new trade barriers, and executive orders barring immigration? Won’t these reduce corporate profits? Answer: Wall Street doesn’t believe he’ll follow through on erecting new trade barriers. And his executive orders on immigration affect such a small portion of the workforce they won’t reduce profits.

Canada has cruelly failed in providing the needed levels of mental health care to those who need it. Why is Justin Trudeau so certain that Mr. Khadir is a terrorist rather than the victim of a mental health disease?  It is disgrace that Justin Trudeau rushes to judge Mohamed Khadir as a terrorist, without the facts all being known.  And yet Mr. Trudeau DID WAIT AND PAUSE to get all the facts in previous violent attacks in Canada. Why did he not pause THIS TIME? Is it because these victims were Muslim?

Ironically I share much of your heritage but I don't see it as being exclusionary as you seem to. I see it as something we should share, something that we should honour as we've built a civilization and society that so many other cultures want to join. In fact it is that heritage and rule of law that allows for us to have the level of equality, acceptance and diversity that we do. It's why we can accommodate others into our society without being afraid of them.

District drawing should be non-partisan, done with computers to generate the shortest possible boundaries. The electoral college is an ancient anti-democratic legacy of slavery days. We no longer have slaves, we should similarly ban the electoral college, or at least, make it vote as one for the winner of the popular vote.

I agree, you could swing the needle in Alaska easier than another state because of population, but considering Alaska has gone red in every election since 1960 (with the exception of the massive blue sweep that was 1964), its hard to argue that a swing is likely. Yes the GOP is currently a trashcan fire, but the same was true in 04, 08, 12 and we still went decisively red.

Professionals treat them with a combination of drugs and or psychoanalysis.  Ther is lots of evidence that treatment works, when it isn't banned for political reasons of course.

1,"Richard Rhyner, the bigoted racist comes out in support of the bigoted, racist, sexual predator who thinks he should be the leader of the free world. How surprising.  Honestly, Rhyner, I do not know why the Democrats do what they do. I'm not a democrat.  I am, however, against racism, bigotry, and sexual assault which is why I've publicly repudiated many of your comments in the past and why I am firmly against Trump.

0,"""""I could pull up 20 or 30 quotes from the King James version of the Christian Bible""""  You could, but it'd be difficult to find a large mass of people on the planet today who still practice those beliefs/quotes and still run around causing havoc such as the London incidents.

Canadian born are less employed than newcomers, and also more homeless, have you noticed?This Liberal death government are manipulative fraudsters, with their abusive diversity ideas discriminating against Canadians. If you are Canadian born, pick a party to join or run as an independent: www.elections.ca

0,"They couldn't even meet for a one week council our of fear of having to go through a Vatican 2 style revolution/reformation, how on Earth would anyone imagine a desire to unite with Catholicism in its current liturgical state.  The Orthodox liturgy have changed very little, they simply cannot recognize the new Roman rite. The only chance for reunion is if we get closer to each other, either by them also going through a reformation/revolution or us rolling back all the changes that do not have origin beyond the 60's.  Even then it may not be enough, I can't imagine them accepting either of the Vatican councils without them being defined as local councils for the Roman rite exclusively.  Even then why should they, look at the fruits of the change in the dominant RC countries, the importance of Christian faith is decimated compared to the East, where only Poland is the exception.

There should be some personal honour even in politics and Maimane seems to very young to have lost whatever he had. Remember, Maimane too is a tweeter!

1,"Self defense? Here's the scenario: I, at 5' tall, come at you with a knife. You grab for it, your hand is cut but you wrest it away from me. I, at 5' and unarmed, continue my assault. You stab me once, twice, thrice, five times. I am undeterred. I continue my assault, like a wounded grizzly. Six, twelve, two dozen stab wounds. I'm still assaulting. Three dozen - now four. TotalBS. Slime trying to save his sorryass from what awaits in prison.
