0,"Do you realize that your victim-blaming is on a par with """"look at what she wearing, she was asking for it..."""" and such.  How about we make some meaningful effort to teach our young males that consensual sex involves actual consent. Absent consent, it's sexual assault.  In a civilized society, women would be able to walk the streets and even go out for a drink or three without fear of being raped. We've got a looooong ways to go, but victim-blaming is the wrong direction.

0,"""""Her main goal is to provide security for her children by purchasing a home in the Toronto suburb where she lives.""""  If she is hoping to buy a home soon, the best place for the money is in a savings account.  If she may buy a home in the medium term, she could need the money all at once, so a ladder of non-cashable GICs is the worse thing she could have. Putting the almost-$300K into something like Mawer Balanced Fund would be preferable.

0,"Having only been to a few remote Alaskan communities, and never for more than a couple of weeks at a time, I'm not prepared to dispute your claims.  However, I have seen similar situations in American (and Western) Samoa, where some Mata'i and despotic church leaders wield power which enables them to grievously abuse and exploit their own folks.  The ruling elite of the """"Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa"""" being among the worst.  In Western Samoa they've burned down churches of other denominations and drove their congregants from the island.  On a global scale such individuals used to be called """"neocolonial administrators""""--i.e., locals who could be bribed and/or hired to keep the """"natives"""" in line.  Diem, Saddam, Pah'lavi, Noriega, Mubarak and Marcos were among the more prominent examples.  Some """"slipped their leashes"""", some were driven out by their own people, and some were betrayed by their imperialist """"benefactors"""" when it became convenient and/or profitable.

1,"I work downtown 5 days a week. Despite the free pet waste bags/receptacles and porta potties....both dog and human feces are definitely still a problem. The city workers really try to clean it all up but not on a daily basis. I also see a lot of vomit on the walls and sidewalks. I walk to and from the bus stop and sometimes to and from lunch. As a fifty year old woman, I am not afraid necessarily, but I am disgusted with what we allow in our downtown. If didn't work there...I would not go there for anything. Downtown Eugene is just plain old gross.

0,"People seem to understand what an invasive plant is. Well, the domestic cat, allowed to roam, is an example of the same thing. That exotic plant in your home is very beautiful, but allowed outside, it can spread unhindered, choking out native plants and destroying native habitat.  The European Wild Cat spread naturally throughout Europe without the assistance of humans. It is an integral part of its environment.

1,"We'll see.  2018 represents 18 more months of this Trump circus.  People may get very tired of it and vote very differently than it looks now.  The absolute worst thing the Dems could do in 2020 is a run a centrist candidate.  Putting the Blue Dog Clinton in the White House forced the GOP to go waay to far to the right to separate themselves from the Dems.  It is the GOP that will need to re evaluate if they want to stay a white party for whites because in less than a couple of decades the 'fringes' will be the majority.
"
0,"Ignorant as I was of the extensive, expensive festivities planned for our 150th, I wasn't sure what to make of the headline. I knew nothing of an actual giant rubber duck - let alone how or why it figures so prominently in our historical landscape.  So - absent that bit of minutia - I was left to assume that 'look away from the giant duck' was a euphemism for our unhealthy preoccupation with that other large amorphous yellow blob south of the border. It's not really our fault, mind you. If you engage at all in mainstream media, you can't possibly avoid the ubiquitous coverage of all things Trump.  So had it been about that giant ugly duck, the story would have had my full support. Indeed I'd like to suggest that - as a nation - we go cold turkey on that duck for the entire month of July. A whole month of freedom from an unsightly sore on the backside of humanity, and with it the national wringing of hands over the fear it might be malignant.

Yet these schools, working with affiliated nonprofits, can raise funds, including Grants in Aid from the Leg, to build facilities at a fraction of the costs.  Why is the idea of using this less costly facility tool not considered? Oh, right, these are our public charter schools, representing a different iteration of public school governance an funding.  Neither the Board of Ed not the Leg is allowed to use the C word.  Yet we struggle to fund under the most expensive model, the DOE with the more costly procurement code.

He's a nice person, served our country, but since he has been running for House District 14, he's basically dodged all my questions regarding his plans and policies, specifically about """"living wage"""" - as a business owner in Eugene, I believe that we (small businesses) should be part of the discussion as it impacts us, and thus the living wage jobs, when wages are raised. I am concerned that James has lost sight of the actual cause and is doing what he needs to do to be elected into office.

Put them side by side and question why you give one (Clintons) an unquestioning pass and confidently condemn the other (Trump).  When you consider that the actual evidence is equally weak against either, why is one seen as obvious slander and the other an admission of guilt?

0,"As Squiggs pointed out FoxNews is desperately trying to divert attention such as Jeanine Pirro and other pundits demanding Mueller be fired.  Problem with your argument of bias about Mueller and his team is he already got one of Trump’s men, Papadopoulos to plead guilty and probably flip on the others.  This is similar to the Kealohas where the Feds got one ex HPD officer to plead guilty who flipped on his superiors that ultimately helped bring charges to other HPD AND the Kealohas.  Like the Kealohas, Mueller is going up food chain with indicting Manafort and Gates, who might flip and give up poeple like Jared Kushner and even Trump.  The way things are going Trump is not even going to finish out his term, much less get re-elected with a current approval rating of about 33%.  Even if guilty, doubt Trump will ever spend time in prison, however his son in law Kushner might not be so lucky.  If that happens will wife Ivanka and her children visit Kushner in the slammer?

1,"It's scary, but there is nothing really new here. There have been public demonstrations of car hacks, and only recently does it seem like manufacturers have been taking the risks seriously and working on more resilient designs.  For people who work in information security, there doesn't seem to be anything really remarkable in the dump at all. We know the CIA, like all modern intelligence agencies, maintains an arsenal of internet attack tools. We also know that pretty much every internet-connected system has flaws that can be exploited. Some of the details are of interest, but on balance, nothing surprising here.  The main takeaway from all of this is: Sucks to be the CIA right now.

0,"No one in this story, or in regulated hunting is killing """"the very essence of wild nature"""". The essence of nature is life, death, and rebirth. And guess what? We all participate, even vegetarians, even the purist vegans, as the holiest of vegetarians call themselves. Most meat eaters, including anti-hunters, pay someone else to kill their animals. Vegetarians? They also pay others to kill animals, as do we, in the service of their lives. Think one can grow, process, and transport plant matter without killing animals? Think again. How about the production of hydrocarbons to fuel your car and warm your home? Then there is the matter of running those cars and trucks and other vehicles over living beings, particularly on warm, rainy nights. And on and on. Our living means death to other animals. Continually.  The essence wild nature is being killed not by hunting, but by the destruction of habitat by unrestrained human population growth and industrialization. We're in denial about that.

0,"This motion is all show and no substance.  Apparently, it is not enough that governments enact and enforce laws against racism and discrimination.  They must be seen to do something when tragedy strikes, like the mass killing in the Quebec City mosque.  So, a private member sponsors a motion to show solidarity with the victims and victims' families.  Everybody is happy: """"Look! the government does care.""""  It amounts to nothing except for one thing.  The motion sets one type of hatred above the others.  Instead of condemning all forms of hatred and discrimination, it specifically names Islamophobia.  One does not always know how some might use this singling out of Islam in the future.  Why bother then?  Why not simply condemn all hatred?  Does it somehow change the meaning of the gesture?

0,"This is a well-liked comment - 23 and counting.  But to offer a  voice of dissension, I believe Canada needs a flow of immigration, as long as it is balanced and respects integration and the economy.  What we do not need, is an important labour force, that competes for jobs  not only with Canadian citizens and residents, but also with our refugees and new immigrants.  If we stop the reliance of certain business sectors on indentured servitude, then this will open up job opportunities, and help ensure market rates for labour and skills.  Eliminating imported labour has to happen first. And then we just might find that we are better able to accommodate immigration.

0,"A curriculum designed around teacher's personal passions is a colossal mistake. The kids may or may not like it, but the fact is that they are not being educated. Schools need a curriculum designed from the top down where knowledge builds on knowledge and scarce resources are used wisely. Letting every teacher teach his/her passion just leaves huge gaps in knowledge and kids graduate with little more than a fuzzy idea of how the world around them came to be or how it functions. This kind of  flaky progressive education is the biggest reason our society has been so dumbed-down.  They haven't given anything resembling a daily verb test in a long time. They don't even teach the parts of speech anymore or basic grammar and punctuation. One teacher may spend a few weeks on it as part of his/her personal """"passion"""" but there is no organized teaching of these essentials.  I can't believe how out of touch many are with what is (most importantly isn't)  being taught in the schools today.

I think it's worth remembering that the Senator's remarks were more about the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) than the schools themselves. (Her remarks, misguided in my opinion, were that the TRC did not bring out the good things those schools did.) So far, the TRC has given our country 94 Calls to Action. The ways we engage those Calls to Action will be shaping our country and reconciling its peoples over the next generation, at least, and everyone will be far better for it.

(Looking back, he was young, then, but we didn't know this. :-) )  His visionary """"Man and the Environment"""" course was decades ahead of its time -- as was Harry on so many issues -- in its attention to environmental and global issues, and the holistic, interconnected, synergies among them. His behind-the-scenes, lead-by-example style had a major influence in moving the Seattle area forward (and those who learned from us) on various environmental issues -- both directly and indirectly through his gentle impact on others.

This is the same argument of """"choosing"""" or free will that has been largely put to rest in regards to homosexuality. It's just resurfacing in the transgendered debate. Not being an expert, I have to admit to guessing there is a transgendered range from radical transition as in surgery to demonstrating behaviors of the gender one feels comfortable in. Regardless, I can't imagine why anyone would want to suffer the social stigma, let alone surgical trauma to be able to enter a woman's bathroom. But the crux is that this is seen as a choice, not deterministic. As such, it goes to the root of the biblical """"bad seed"""" who intentionally commits a sin. But why not worry about lesbians in bathrooms? Just because their biology is the same, they still find themselves interested in women. Why are they not a threat, but a transgender person is?

You’ll be great again because I’m great!” Trump shows little understanding of how democratic institutions actually work and he demonstrates no inclination to work within them. Of course he’s a fascist.  However, although Trump is a fascist, the United States in 2016 is not Germany in the 1930s.  Our institutions are stronger, our democracy more secure.  I think the United States would survive a Trump presidency, but given Trump's utter contempt for our system and institutions of government, his presidency would constitute the most serious test of constitutional government since the Civil War.

Also the performance of the US economy has helped Canada as they buy more of our cars.  Trudeau is not doing any better than Harper but has spent billions more.

0,"Langevin had nothing to do with the running of the residential schools . Blaming him for what transpired is like blaming Henry Ford for all the deaths from vehicle accidents.  Another more serious consideration is the never undertaken critical review of the TRC report. It was released and immediately attained the status of a religious book. Any attempted academic review of its abundant  anecdotal comments that pass for intellectual discourse would be immediately attacked with all the fury that extreme dogma could arouse.  To try and add a little unbiased insight to this national Jonestown anecdotal tome I suggest Googling 'Indian agents and residentials schools' . It is a historical report on residential schools done 40 years before the TRC and it is unbiased, informative and contradicts much of what is in  the 25 million dollar TRC report. The reason for that is there was no current prospect of money to be made at the time it was written.

So, if the government doesn't know if foreigners are causing the problem then how would a foreign buyer tax help?  If as some agents say it is 40%, well that's huge but if it's less than 5% then who much impact would taxing foreigners have?  My comment re immigrants is that immigrants need places to live...if Canada/Toronto accepts lots of immigrants then those immigrants all need places to live right?  If our cities aren't having enough homes built, then, now pay attention, demand will be higher than supply.  When demand is higher than supply, then prices rise....similarly, when there is more than what people want, prices should decline to reflect less demand.

0,"Where to begin?  Mrs. Clinton (and most other educated folk) speaks in whole paragraphs, but I can readily think of one exception: The Donald.  He has the vocabulary and sentence structure of a wobbly 4th grader.  Even you must be willing to acknowledge that.  The Clintons and the Obamas didn't inherit daddy's money.  Their wealth (and it pales in comparison to our president's - that is, if you believe our president) was earned.  Mrs. Clinton has always worked for women's and children's issues, beginning in law school or before.  Mr. Trump has never worked for or supported anyone with the possible exception of his family.  Mrs. Clinton (who was the candidate in 12016) has engaged in no philandering; Mr. Trump, on the other hand, is the poster boy for pu**y-grabbing and multi-marrying.

Also cutting corporate taxes and taxes for the rich are always tough sells and only can be sold if on the basis of needing to remain economically competitive, selling them on the idea of they just pay less taxes won't work for most.

The daily destruction of all human and civil rights contained within the U.S. Constitution to be replaced by a Fascist, Theocratic Dictatorship.  The Beacon of Democracy is imploding by the single hand of a maniac aided and abetted by Republican Traitors and the cowardice of the rest of the populace.

Adam always surrounded himself with good friends. I would go as far as saying Adam was not the only one out there with military training. You call for gun control. I say, have more gun safety and training class's. Let's not take away the guns. However have proper know how available. I think we should all be taught how to properly handle a gun. That way we don't pull a family guy and destroy a good defensive tool. Just before we may need it the most. To make guns a good defensive tool we need to offer out proper knowledge to everyone. that way we can get back to holding people accountable for their actions.

They have driven house prices from stupid (5-7 times income, or about double the long-term ratio) to completely insane (7 - 10 and up).  This has completely priced younger Canadians out of many markets, or made them house poor if they can beg and borrow enough to buy anything;  (2) He reversed the sensible decision to raise the OAS age to 67 - young workers pay for all of that;  (3)  He is spending money like crazy, on all sorts of useless subsidies and schemes, thus rapidly increasing the debt the young will have to cover;  Then there is the general incompetence, spending on consumption, not investment, and his total ignorance of how incentives matter.   He may be cute when marching in parades, but for Canada, and especially younger people, he is a total disaster.

On one hand, the situation when one has to work abroad to gain relevant experience (i.e. go to Silicon Valley) is not something that should be considered the basis for double taxation or expulsion from Canada.

On the third hand, we really can't have much say in where people spend money they paid taxes for.  I think the only solution is to treat people who withdraw from Canadian RRSP's or receive Canadian pensions as Canadian tax residents.

0,"Obedience to one's specific workings of grace is a good way to think, although the phrase """"obedience to"""" is a little fraught with misleading implications. Here, it means """"being mindful of"""" and """"being self-nurturing with,"""" I'd say. All too often, """"obedience"""" in Church talk implies conformity to someone else's idea of grace, someone who uses authority and position to reduce genuine mindfulness of the various workings of grace among people for the comfort and tidiness the authority personally yearns for. But, seen with respect for each other, obedience to one's specific workings of grace can encompass the flashes of insight and loss of simple adherence to Catechismic ideas that come from seeing, in all their power, the cracks and contradictions, the disasters and atrocities, that can be enacted in the name of authority and those who think they own the definition and meaning of grace.

The only reason the whole subprime industry has done fairly well in Canada, until this, is that between foreign buyers, and enough solid-income Canadian buyers, the shaky borrowers could sell in a pinch.  Then nobody ever heard about how close to the edge they were in the sense of not covering payments from labour income, or the rent generated by an extra property.  Hopefully political outrage will drive Junior to limit the foreign buyers in a few ways, and cut the domestic side of the bubble by scaling back CMHC's involvement.

This country has made the mistake, most notably with Carter and Obama, believing that people who are smart and talk nice are good leaders.  The best leaders are those who take action instead of talk; who make decisions instead of endlessly trying to find compromise.  It's the definition of leading:  stay out in front while others follow behind you.  Jefferson, Lincoln, and FDR were great leaders for their acts, not their rhetoric.  They made hard decisions even if it pissed some people off.

It is not President Trump's firing of James Comey that means anything (it was completely legal and in many ways justified).

Pressuring the FBI director in this manner IS a crime — otherwise known as “obstruction of justice.” You could be a small-town security guard or the President of the United States. The crime is treated the same — subpoenas are issued, charges are brought and the allegations are adjudicated in a court of law.

The Majority Party in Power down in Lobbyist Land was in charge of the show, and those who did try to speak, or try to move on the issues, were refused a venue to speak their concerns. The Majority Party voted in lockstep with.... caucus ideology? What a farce. With no chance to even be heard on the floor, those who did try to stop this train wreck were left shaking their heads.  Send those who wielded the gavel packing. Pete Kelley, Click Bishop, Mike Dunleavy as ringleaders of the Finance Committee need to GO. Follow them with Mike Hawker, Mike Chenault, and Lesil McGuire.

My point was that when you compromise with the left it usually amounts to a one way trip to less  freedom for law abiding citizens. That's why they must not be allowed to stack the courts. As for incrementalism; notions that would have been scoffed at a very short time ago, (sickos in girls facilities, team mascots under attack, unchecked immigration, the PC insanity that comes out of college campuses, the idea that you can be forced to buy insurance no matter the cost); those notions then become the """"new normal"""", """"the law of the land"""" as Obama likes to say. Often these changes come by bureaucratic fiat or by activist judges rather than the legislative process.  They call it precedence. Then these travesties are pointed to as comparable justification for the next loss of freedom that gets pushed onto an unwilling or uninformed public.

Some of Elway's early magic seems to have left the building to include letting T.J. Ward go and thinking that Simmons could replace him.

A cultured person will generally forgive wrongdoing, but this is usually done after an apology and an attempt to make amends.  In this case they got neither.  Their freedom is certainly something to be thankful for, but losing your home, your business, your friends, and paying out 20K in fines and 9K in """"expenses"""" means the Chinese still think they are guilty and have in no way apologized or made amends.  Don't forget, this was after they did many humanitarian works on behalf of the Chinese.  Trudeau might have made a diplomatic coup by securing their freedom but without restitution and an apology I would say the victory is somewhat hollow.

College officials said he was failing his course work, and fellow students described him as belligerent and potentially dangerous… Mr. Flores apparently entered the nursing school building shortly before 8:30 this morning and methodically sought out his victims, all of them female nursing instructors… [Fellow nursing student Lori Schenkel] said that last year he bragged in front of several students that he had received a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

0,"Almost every law enforcement or peace officer takes an oath to uphold the US Constitution. Our immigration laws were duly passed by duly elected Representatives and Senators of the United States.  That oath is an obligation on the part of the said officers. If they choose to disregard their duties they signal that we are a nation of men and NOT laws. This oath not only gives them the power to do their jobs, but the authority to carry out law they may personally disagree with.

0,"President Trump is forcing all of us to find reasons to support our current institutions. that's not an inherently a bad thing.  Unless you want violent revolution, we should encourage our nation to 'stir the pot' every so often.  The problem is that President Trump feels he should be the only American (with his elite friends), to determine the course of the country and our institutions.    Personally, he's the last person I want representing my family and our values.  President Trump is overtly and without a tinge of shame, willing to denigrate the work of leadership that in some cases provided great results for the nation, including leadership of the Republican party.     It's a frightening display of arrogance and a clear grab for power from a man who has always used the power of wealth to get what he wants.  Democrats have to get off their seats and stop expecting the government to speak for them and solve all problems.  Independents will listen when Dem's have a vision.

We do need effective leadership that is not burdened down by extremists on the left and right. Never the twain shall meet.  Washington DC is a political bubble that is in no way connected with real America.

The documents clearly show that Israel is the party that is not interested in a peace settlement.  And Israel has never agreed to return the land beneath the settlement blocks that site far inside the greenline.   That is a condition of a just peace because the Palestinians need a contiguous state inside the 22% of the land that remains.  Instead Israel offers a garbage dump. 2. Demographics: 1900 about 8% pop of palestine is Jewish   1914 moves up to 13% 3.  The post by Wheeler above is evidence of the terrible and one-sided reporting on the conflict by the MSM.

In 2014, he refused the request of two United Nations committees to impose mandatory reporting under canon law. In 2015, the Italian Catholic Bishops Conference of which he is its senior bishop, repeated that they will not be reporting allegations against clerics to the civil authorities because Italian civil law does not require it. In January 2016, the PCPM said bishops have amoral and ethical duty to report irrespective of civil reporting laws. This does not appear in its December 2016 guidelines. His claimed """"zero tolerance"""" for abusive priests is untrue The figures for dismissal show 75% tolerance. While there may be theological objections to women priests, vicars general, episcopal vicars and judicial vicars cannot be women because canon law requires them to be priests.

Where humans everywhere believed that the natural world was animated by unseen spirits, a few ancient Greeks stumbled upon the idea that unseen spirits had created rules by which nature operates. They began the process of studying those rules, and they gave to those who included this learning in their culture an advantage over all those who still relied on beliefs in unseen spirits.

Yes, it was negligent, but doubt it was intentional-it was an accident. Rather, serendipitously though, the whole PPD has been changed rather quickly and hopefully for the better.

Also if we could get cheaper prices for medicine, that would be great, we could have better care without having ludicrous copays for some meds. We spend stupid amounts of money on healthcare compared with many other wealthier nations for a lesser quality of care in many cases. So lots of room for improvement, but it could be (and was) far worse.

0,"Interesting letter Mr. Minshall. My own feelings on war are from a non theological perspective. When it comes to the dirge of war, where as in the case of world war, part 1 and 2, the vast majority of the nearly 60 million casualties were/are people that had little to do with the implications that led to the war. Japan attacked one of our 'military' targets, and in the end, our revenge was put on upon the Japanese 'civilians.' No need for apology because the dirge of war has no sanity, and it looked like the Emperor was 'just a gardener,' and it was the Japanese military calling all the shots that led to the deaths of so many innocent civilians. Asking the military (in any sphere) to repent for there violent actions is useless. Seems to me, if it were possible at all, wars would've ended a long time ago. But civilians, whether they 'are' or 'not' religious in perceiving what is or has happened to them, is only possible if they're still alive. And usually, that is not the case.

Leaders like Dolan paid the pedophile priests that raped us 20k each to quietly leave the priesthood and settle in unsuspecting communities, to offend again and again. Then like in Milwaukee the victims of these priests were re abused by the Milwaukee Archdiocese five year brutal bankruptcy that was an attack on us victims. The archdiocese promised healing and resolution with fair compensation to those who came forward. We all know this was just a mean trick to get as many victims to come forward so the archbishop could use every legal dirty tactic to get as many of our claims dismissed as possible. There was no healing only more pain and more betrayal. Most of us received less than the priests that raped us. That bankruptcy has left me emotionally devastated. I have little hope to ever heal from this. Thank you Kieran for your efforts to protect children.

0,"Maybe the Rockies lose anyway, but I absolutely cringed when Black pulled Jake McGee in favor of Ottavino. McGee was tiring, but I still like his chances of retiring Austin Barnes enough to not bring Otto in with traffic on the bases. Otto's been a time bomb all year, even back when he was managing to escape without damage. Today was the complete disaster that should force the Rockies to accept the notion that Ottavino is broken and in need of something more than a stint on the 10-day DL.  The Rockies need to trade for bullpen help, but it's a bit early to do that in terms of who's out there on the market. In the meantime, why not bring up Jairo Diaz? It's hard to see him being worse than some of the guys currently in the pen.  I don't even mind seeing the Rockies lose to a really good Dodgers team, if the Dodgers actually earn it. But these past two games were handed to them on a silver platter.

So our current laws primarily help the rich, subsidizing the purchase of the absurdly-large homes you see going up all over, and literally paying folks to go even further in debt and purchase giant homes. Fact is, Oregon simply can't afford to do that, these days!  Here's Wiser's comment, re-phrased: “These [the current Oregon laws] help [rich] people buy bigger [and second] homes, but they don’t necessarily help [middle-income] people buy [their first] home.” Yep, that's correct.

In fact if the 'guest worker' program that saw thousands of  Turkish people arrive in Germany a few decades ago is an indicator, the integration of the most recent immigrants is questionable. The Turkish 'guest workers' never left for the most part. Today they live in their own neighbourhoods pretty much cut off from the rest of German society. As a matter of fact I think a photo of Canadian parliamentarians would reveal a real diversity of national origin. I don't think the same could be said for Germany. If Canada had accepted a similar proportion of refugees the number would have been over 400,ooo and that would have been on top of our normal 300,000 immigrants or so.

He went 5 straight qtrs without scoring on the 28th ranked Chargers defense except one broken coverage play that DT went 75 yds on his own from a short out route.  Broken down Manning comes in with the same players against the same defense and the Broncos score on 4 straight possessions and the playoffs were saved. .

0,"Yes.  There is a great need to revisit the stories on which much of our faith is based, certainly the basic Garden of Eden stories, ideas of original sin, ideas of what is a sin, the idea that the Jewish faithful were more precious to God than all others He imbued with human life, the idea that the Bible is God's Word, rather than the wisdom of the ages and the cultures in which the stories were written.  We need a mythology and philosophy that recognizes we evolved and are evolving, that we cannot """"know"""" God, even though He put a yearning in our minds and hearts to seek Him.   We have to be able to admit we can only find some aspect of God in imperfect forms of metaphor and allegory and we need to be able to take new knowledge and adapt/change/create the metaphor and allegory that reflects our new understandings.  In other words, there is no infallible-for-all-time dogma.  We need to learn to be humble.  Some need that lesson rather badly.

For one thing, the indictment is reportedly a sealed matter before a grand jury, and therefore the defense bar—a common source of proper disclosures of grand jury information—would have no reason to know about it. It seems unlikely Congress would have been briefed at this stage either. The nature of the term “briefed” suggests we are not dealing with Mueller’s staff, who wouldn’t need to be briefed on their own investigation, or court staff before whom the matter takes place. The only obvious group of people who would have been “briefed” are the deputy attorney general and his staff at the Department of Justice.""""

No actual illegal border crossers making false refugee claims were actually be able to see the ministers inasmuch as they were surrounded by photographers, mounties and others for what is nothing but a photo opp to con the rubes that something meaningful is being done.  Secondly, these illegals will not be taking the time even if they had the internet access to read the bland statements by the ministers.  What they have heard about through the illegal migrants grapevine is the PM's ridiculously irresponsible tweet of several months ago that everyone claiming to be fleeing persecution was welcome in Canada.  Period.  (Even if said persecution was nothing more than a new president promising to keep his promises and to actually enforce the laws of the land.)  At least Ralph Goodale didn't carry any illegal migrants' baggage, leaving this to the RCMP.  At his age, he would have gotten a hernia.

Cousin told the House of Lords that refugees were massing in the war-torn country having fled conflict and poverty. Cousins said the collapse of functioning government in Libya had led to a breakdown of border control – meaning migrants from across Africa were flocking to the coast in a desperate bid to reach Europe.

I had a look at them, and as much as we can laud the several thousand immigrants from southeast Asia, they are a small part of the 200K+ immigrants a year.  Harper's policy followed his doctrine of mercantilism, which limited immigration and aid to those who could demonstrate a net wealth transfer to Canada. Fair enough, but it isn't always about money. If it was we wouldn't have the Irish or the Ukranians, or other waves of past immigrants.  But more to the point, and why I feel Harper was being malicious, is his transparent antipathy to anything and anyone in the Middle East with the exception of that single country whose every action Harper would approve unconditionally and without reservation.  Syrian refugees languished, intentionally, for a long time, until we elected a government compassionate and visionary enough to finally remove the administrative roadblocks preventing them from coming to Canada.

We want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country. They're having a lot of their product made outside."""" They are """"Grand standers"""". (Truth is so does Donald Trump, his goods are made where?) . Why the sudden change? It couldn't be because these executives don't support Trump's position on Charlottesville?  I believe they saw him for who he is and walked away.  FACTS and I can verify these comments if you wish Gene.

He said, ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’” Subsequently, the President’s Senior Adviser, Stephen Miller, stated, “Fundamentally,[despite “technical” revisions meant to address the Ninth Circuit’s concerns in Washington,] you’re still going to have the same basic policy outcome [as the first].”  Judge Watson applied the laws of the United States in issuing his TRO against Trump's revised executive order.

0,"Government could remove the CMHC/Genuity requirement for insuring a less than 20% down purchase with the stroke of a pen.  Of course, then they would lose that roughly $1 billion per year that flows to the Treasury, with virtually no payouts, so it won't happen.  Each 1% nominal mortgage rate rise independent of CMHC could pay for 1 total loss to the banks on every 100 homes, ignoring frictional/administrative costs.  Do you really think that we would see total, 100% wipeouts on 10 out of every 100 homes, year after year, if actual mortgage rates rose to say 13% long term ( a rise of 1000 basis points)?  That's just a thought experiment stress test to show that it wouldn't happen.

I went to many parent and teachers meetings over this deal. I find it interesting that you state the economy under Bush did not crumble until 2008 like all the years Bush was in office and his programs had not a thing to do with the deep recession that Obama was in when he took office. It was just magical happening when Obama got elected. And less we forget Cheney and Halliburton.

0,"Using a LOC or margin account to buy a solid company at a huge bargain is far less risky than moving money in and out trying to time the market.  My monthly dividend cash flow generates enough every month or two to make a new purchase or add to a position.  Meaning that if I am fully invested and an exceptional opportunity comes along I can use debt to cover my cash deficit for a couple of months.  The proportion of debt to equity under this scenario for me would be about 2 or 3% (at the max) of my total portfolio.  Hardly putting my financial security in jeopardy.  By the way your analogy is a bit backwards.  You are the one that is planting cans of cash that produce nothing - Ancientalso is planting a crop that not only can be harvested but replants itself resulting in even higher crop yields the following year.

0,"The office of Equity and Compliance is requisite in conforming with Title IX - every school must have said office; hence, the duty of care which she is alleging was the 'mandatory reporting of domestic abuse' duty that is required by anyone who reports to that office. It's a failing argument for 2 reasons. 1) The duty to report is only placed on those who fall under the jurisdiction of OEC. OEC doesn't have unilateral authority to assume jurisdiction over someone simply because they are employed by an institution where an OEC office exists. The nexus of 'He works here' may satisfy a singular element of the claim - but it's not wholly satisfying as it needs to be since her claim is retroactive to his date of hire. 2) The duty to report requires first-hand knowledge of the abuse - not an unsubstantiated allegation that came via phone.

0,"No, I don't think that.  I think it's time business owners were taxed at the same rate as the rest of us instead of the preferential treatment they currently receive.  I am quite familiar with payroll taxes, thanks, having been general manager of a restaurant and owned my own business.  And I believe payroll taxes are a necessity in an advanced and compassionate country such as Canada.  And all Canadians pay those taxes in the form of higher prices, as you should know if you are a business owner.  And BTW, you said """"When you, as a salaried employee, don’t pay the required pension contribution it takes to keep the system going"""" -- nothing wrong with my comprehension, nick.

0,"I thought this  opinion was well written, balanced and accurate.  I did not like the title and entered into reading a little defensive.       I tragically became a single father of a 5 year old girl nine years ago.  The experience has taught me much about myself.  I think i have done a pretty good job but I am cognizant of the fact that my daughter was raised very differently than had her mother been around.  Part of that was the things that were needed that I was never socialized to know about and had to learn (I can now braid hair...kind of).  Part were things that were genetic like conflict resolution.  Other single parents likely faced different hurdles but in my individual experience this article described it well.  It does beg the reverse question however.  While I don't doubt there is gender discrimination in the workplace, I do wonder if at least some of the disparity in gender representation in male dominated careers does not arise from similar innate differences.

If you study their history of involvement in free speech issues you will see they've supported the free speech rights of some individuals who I, personally, consider rather despicable.  However, we can't limit the free speech rights of everyone we might consider despicable.......limiting the constitutional rights of one persons is, as is often said, limiting the constitutional rights of all.

0,"The Nats' average of 6.13 innings per start out of their starters is the best in the majors right now; they and SF are the only teams averaging six innings per start (and what good has it done the Giants?). More than half the teams in baseball fall somewhere between 5.5 and 6.0 innings average per start, with the Rockies ranked 8th overall (5th in the NL) at 5.6 innings per start. So while it's obviously good to teach young pitchers to pitch more economically and get deeper into games, the Rockies are nowhere near the point where this has been a major issue for them, in fact they're better than most right now. Everybody struggles to get through six innings these days, which is why bullpens are such a huge component in today's game.  Another bullpen arm to replace Ottavino or Dunn would be a huge help, it would allow everybody below them in the bullpen pecking order to slide down a spot and would push somebody like Lyles or Oberg out of the 'pen entirely.

The disagreement amongst organisations that are in an alliance exist all over the world. Those between Cosatu and the ANC are no different. The existence of the differences, on it's own, should not be a reason to disband the alliance. We are making the point that the alliance exist, precisely, because the organisations in that alliance have different points of view. Otherwise, there would have been no need for an alliance. A merger would have been more appropriate.

But your approaches to mitigating risk and shielding young people from harm are inconsistent. That's what I'm getting at.

My point is, after legalization a lot of stigma will be gone and those that have a toke will be treated a lot different.  You can see it already, those same parents who a couple of years ago would not let their children be around pot smokers are now investing in large grows and are trying to legalize the selling of pot in their franchised drug store, or what ever.

0,"John,  Just taking one claim: per the FBI, and Radford University's FGCU Serial Killer Information Center if you want a third party, about 90% of serial killers are men and about 60% of the nation's serial killers are white. African-Americans comprise about 20%. The numbers more or less track with actual demographics for other identified racial groups.  The data on pedophilia is similar, it tracks more or less with actual demographics. I'd have to dig to see about travel, but that would probably track with economic status within the subset of pedophiles more closely than race.  This is Crim 101 stuff; that a person like Bloom makes such patently, and easily exposed, false claims -and- engages in rhetorical nonsense like conflating violent and non-violent crime statistics, or not noting the difference between raw numbers of occurrences instead of noting whether those raw numbers are disproportionate to the actual demographics, is why I call her analysis nonsense.

Since Mr. Gorak is already a member of the commission with experience in the docket issues, I don't see how the objections of some disgruntled legislators can be taken seriously.

0,"By all means, disparities and inadequacies in how police classify sexual assault allegations should be addressed. However, the following claim by the Globe editors is mere speculation:  """"One result is that many women are choosing not to report sexual assaults to police, because they fear – with good reason, often – that they will not be taken seriously.""""  It's unlikely that either women or men are generally aware of how police go about classifying sexual assault cases. And it's self-evident that even in jurisdictions where the """"unfounded"""" rate is higher that sexual assaults are being reported, otherwise the cases couldn't be categorized as unfounded.  If sexual assaults are in fact under-reported, there are probably a number of reasons for it. The Globe's obsession with the """"unfounded"""" issue is understandable, given that they discovered it. But the government should take a far more broad and holistic view of the matter.

You saw what I saw, but from a different viewpoint, Janine.  What I saw, was Law Enforcement, and most citizens within that neighbourhood, attempting to come unto grasps within a situation that they had no prior experience within.  What I saw, Janine, was the honest attempt by local citizens, and Law Enforcement, was to identify, and prosecute the offenders, regardless of their own demographic.  That a particular demographic, and ONLY as recent movers, was, at that time, shown, predominately, to identify themselves unto allegiance within the issue at hand, was it not?

I also think compensation is appropriate for those who have demonstrably been injured as a result of vaccination. That being said, unless you are trained in how to read scientific studies, I encourage you first to attend a university or institute of higher learning to study how to interpret scientific studies before you continue long nights reading them.

The very fact that a citizen cannot sue if they are harmed by aerially sprayed poisonous herbicides that drift should be of concern for many of us living in rural private forested areas.  HB 3226 Increases protections of riparian areas, restricts timber harvest and forest road construction in areas with landslide risk.  Sounds like common sense to me.  Runoff and sediment from logging roads is one of the most damaging factors to salmon bearing streams, and we all know of the incidents of landslides that have killed people and destroyed homes.  The Oso landslide- the largest in Washington State history was in part due to logging above and the logging company responsible settled for $60 million.   It's about time we put the health of Oregon in front of the profits to the clear-cut logging industry.

Canada has the Saudi Arabia of wind energy resources in a belt 60 miles wide EW and 250 miles log NS running from the Smallwood reservoir northward, and along the entire length of the Long Range in Newfoundland.  Canada also has enormous wind resources across Northern Quebec, from James Bay to Blanc Sablon.  None of that potential has been developed.  Wind power generation in these belts is spread over a huge geographic area.  It is almost never calm - which means power is virtually always available.  Even if it were, the region also has the largest collection of hydro reservoirs in the world.  They function as huge capacitors.  Adding wind generation to hydro has roughly the same effect as if it were raining all the time in the hydro drainage basin.  The opportunity is immense.

It’s about history and going to place where famous American presidents have resided and history. Whether you are American, Canadian, German, Slovak, Swedish, some just don’t care about American politics.

0,"Trid...it doesn't matter if they're Catholic. The theological disposition of NT scholars doesn't (or rather, shouldn't) factor in to analysis of the texts. Whether Paul authored a letter may be determined by scrutiny of syntax and other stylistic features, vocabulary, historical clues within the text, theological disposition, and other data intrinsic to the texts, as well as external, corroborative evidence. The scholarly consensus on the Pauline epistles is so accepted that John P. Meier, the Catholic favorite of historical Jesus scholars, refers in """"A Marginal Jew"""" to the """"authentic and pseudonymous"""" Pauline Epistles.  That's not to say there's agreement on the pseudepigraphic (non-authentic) letters. They're still DISPUTED. The consensus lies in acceptance of seven of the epistles as authentic.

This has been a problem, because in the middle of these maneuvers that we have witnessed while the WO issue develops, what we have seen is people praying for the guidance of the HS but at the same time """"preying"""" after their brothers and sisters in church.

0,"You are also limiting God.   Yes, He can see the future.  He is outside space and time as we know it.  In other words, He is outside of creation.   He can do what He wants with creation.   So if we are all robots, how do you explain the verses I have come up with?  The ones that clearly show people making choices.   Some people may have a destiny planned out for them, but they also have choices to follow it or not.   Again look at the story of Jonah.   Yes,  Jonah had a destiny, but he also used free will to initially deny it.  Also the Bible always refers to the person's faith, not God's faith.  let me add one more verse for you to consider: Ezekiel 33:11 Say to them: `[As] I live,' says the Lord God, `I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?'

In this scenario, the so called have nots are cut off, or OntarioBC  have to come up with about 15 billion a year, most to Quebec.  Doubtful that would happen, so the Feds try to borrow.  Again doubt too many lenders would line up for this shaky nation.No more extortion money, no Quebec.  Canada is left with Ontario, Manitoba, Atlantic Canada BC.  Feeling cut off, BC either join the USA or Alberta Sask.   A fractured nation, all along the US border, creates risk to American security.  Most provinces seek union into a more secure/finacial US, and become protectorates.   Just my thoughts, sure this has been studied.

More importantly, what we understood of DNA and what it does has not been impacted by the sequencing project.  In other words, DNA sequencing is a natural outgrowth of a theoretical basis established in the 50s.  The technology to sequence DNA would have been wild speculation 40 years ago, but not the vision and theoretical potential of doing so.  I must disagree with Ms. Washington on the discoveries of new planets.  First, they are discoveries not theoretical breakthroughs.  Secondly, in most cases, they were found first, theory followed.  Much of what we believe to be theoretical advance today is really just very sophisticated discovery, not advance in understanding.  Such as the discovery of gravity waves.

0,"A correction and a thought. There was never 36 boards. There have been 36 board areas designated, and 33 of those areas have seen their residents choose to form a board. The three that don't haves boards all have their own reasons for not. When the system was being set up, the Commission that was in charge of it had great debate over who should be eligible to vote and serve on a neighborhood board. One of the choices they made was non-citizens were and are eligible. Interesting in light of the immigration debate going on in our country. Someone shouldn't have to worry about deportation because they want to participate in a neighborhood board. The second debate was if business owners should be allowed to serve or vote. The decision was to have it more like a state or country election and restrict it to people with primary residence in the board's boundaries.  Mr. Dos Santos-tam is correct, business owners are clearly invested in an area and should participate as members of the public.

She stated that resources were readily available and not a consideration for what happened at Benghazi. The Libyan Case officer, Eric Nordstrom agreed.

Just to be accurate, the funding for Diplomatic and Consular Services, including security, increased about 2 billion each year from 2010, 2011 and 2012.

0,"That this doesn't conform to your worldview does not mean I'm quibbling. The Eastern Rites are dynamically different both now and then. The Order of Mass differed from place to place. While they all had the same four parts, they were ordered differently. Some rites and usages contained prayers that were not used in other places. The Kiss of Peace was after the Creed in some places, while it dropped out of use elsewhere. Some utilized more litanies, which are foreign to the Roman Rite. (The litanies used in the Roman Rite are taken from other rites, such as the Gallican.  Yes, the Roman Rite developed over time.) At one time, Rome itself had at least four different ways of celebrating the liturgy depending on where the liturgy was celebrated and who was presiding. There were also differences in the calendars. While they were all God-centered (reverence being subjective) there were differences, which means the Mass was not celebrated the same way everywhere. That's simply a fact.

In addition, over 10 per cent of the Canadian population served in the armed forces, an even higher percentage  portion of the male population.Hundreds of thousands of women entered the work force in non-traditional occupations, including 50,000 in the armed forces.  All working age Canadians had to register under the National Resources Mobilization Act and societal controls were under the War Measures Act resulting in the internment of thousands of Canadians.

In any case in the East there also exist a tradition of calling priests father batushka(батюшка), (oytets)отец, and even pop(поп) in several Slavic languages. Likewise in Greek.

If they disagree on the theology on the basis of their own evaluation and conscience, fine. I’ll still disagree with them, but I would respect the position more. But they do it with an appeal to authority and tradition while selectively deciding which pieces of magisterial authority are legitimate.

Trump can't build the southern wall fast enough. That wall will protect us, too. How do you seal our border by summer? Obviously it can't be done in such a short period. But instead of showing RCMP helping the migrants in, images should be broadcast of the migrants being handcuffed upon entry and deported within a week, with a revised statement by the PM that Canada does not welcome illegal migrants.

0,"I lived in East Africa for two years in the mid-90s and I took meflaquine the entire time with no side effects. Meflaquine was the only effective way to prevent cerebral malaria, which was a problem in the area where I lived. I knew that meflaquine had potential mental side effects because it was written right on the bottle that it could cause vivid dreams or psychosis.  Drug side effects are rare. They can explain a case or two but not an entire troop, which is what Canadian soldiers are claiming. This poor fellow who took his life had just been in Somalia and Rwanda during their most horrible phases. I was haunted for years by pictures of a US soldier being dragged behind a car in the streets of Somalia. The things this young man witnessed are more likely to have deranged him than his anti-malarial pill.  Malaria kills over a million people a year. Once in your system, it can plague you for decades. The people most in danger are ones who haven't had it before. Meflaquine is good.

Trump continues to choose guns over butter, as economists would say,  but those guns are for the US alone. As a result, allies must defend their own interests and increase their own defence spending. Those opposed to this increase in the Canadian defence  budget are not grasping how profoundly Trump is altering the world order in ways that require greater self sufficiency in matters of defence.

There are proper disclosure rules for this kind of 'gift', and so long as the PM followed those rules I don't see a problem with it.

This is a variant expression of a sentiment which is often attributed to Tocqueville or Alexander Fraser Tytler, but the earliest known occurrence is as an unsourced attribution to Tytler in """"This is the Hard Core of Freedom"""" by Elmer T. Peterson in The Daily Oklahoman (9 December 1951): """"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy.""""

If you choose you can then later pay $13,000 more and they will upgrade it. How exactly are you getting a raw deal? Basically, you get to extend the life of your own battery. For tesla chemistry, the 85 kwh appears to be on track for lasting about 500,000 miles, before hitting the 90% level. The NORMAL 60 kwh, would have a life around 250-350K miles. Oddly with the 75Kwh battery in it, they should last around 400K miles give or take. So, the 60Kwh car owners are getting a great deal. And they can always upgrade. Most importantly, ALL OF THE OWNERS are fully aware of this situation and still choose it. WHy Because they can not afford the $75K base, so choose to upgrade later.

In the meantime, we know we are able to spend sustainably from our reserves at $2.0 billion/year. If sometime in the future our revenues increase we can always reverse the income tax/dividend!

0,"Unlike Ibbitson, I don't think the strong population growth in Canada is due to enlightened political leadership. In my experience, politicians are mainly concerned with the short-term goal of getting elected. Therefore, potentially controversial topics such as immigration are generally never addressed at all, or never discussed thoughtfully and realistically, in a balanced way, by any of the main political leaders. If the subject is discussed at all, we usually get a few brief slogans and platitudes, meant to gather votes in selected  jurisdictions. There is no long-term plan or foresight.  According to this simple way of thinking, having more and more people will lead to having more and more older adults who will need the support of more and more younger people and so the population should grow continuously and indefinitely. However, at some point this cycle has to stop, since  limitless and continuous population growth is clearly not possible forever in a world of finite resources.

But sometimes even in family celebrations, the rituals are imposed, and everyone goes along because they feel they """"have"""" to go along.  Given a choice, they might choose to do without a ritual. One year I discovered how freeing it was to be away from home on Thanksgiving.  Big family gatherings at Christmas, Thanksgiving etc may be happy, but often are occasions of stress, rather than joy.  I loved that Thanksgiving - no enforced rituals, no stress.  I have hated birthdays for my entire adult life.  Again, I was away one year on my birthday and so happy to be free of the ritual my family wished to have. I appreciate their intentions, but being away was truly wonderful. I now encourage our adult children to  follow their own choices - whether in naming babies or celebrating Christmas.  Their rituals or lack of rituals, should be their own.

My parish, perhaps, the largest in the archdiocese, Visitation, was in a state of high tension for years as I was growing up. The fear of blacks breaking the boundaries to move into our neighborhood, which they eventually did, was ever present. Never a word, a sermon, a lesson about the racial conflict which hung as a persistent cloud over us. A non-Catholic couple had a meeting in their home regarding union activities. Some black persons were invited to attend. Parishioners swelled to about a 1,000 a night for a period of time till the couple was forced to sell and the parish bought the property to keep the neighborhood white. The RCC was proactive in maintaining segregation. This is well documented. Check out: The Siege of South Peoria Street.

""""systemic racism and discrimination"""" are concrete actions in the real world and fair game for condemning, not so """"fears or aversions"""". """"religious intolerance"""" is ambiguous. It is one thing when translated into actions, i.e. discrimination for example, quite another when it refers to thoughts or feelings.  No government has a right to tell people they cannot FEEL fear or revulsion at anything, irrational or not, period.  First, it is useless and nonsensical, you do not diminish agoraphobia or fear of spiders or fear of flying by condemning it, on the contrary, that risks making it worse. Just as it will only make fears worse when people feel their government is dismissing them.  So the intent can only be to encourage their punishment, and that gets us in more dangerous territory for a country that claims to be a liberal democracy.

So, please tell, why not Sharia?  They may not, of course, submit judgements that violate state or federal law, but people may feel pressured from within the community to abide by it. As such, these 'internal' religious legal institutions can and at times do create parallel societies.  Yes there are Christian religious courts as well, for example the Amish or Catholic tribunals. But given that Western culture and legal system have grown out of Christian law, despite dissimilarities, there is a fundamental compatibility. With Islam this is no the case.

For example, Pioneer helped to upgrade the water filters for the Wailua aqueduct a few years back. Without that, smaller-scale farmers in the area wouldn't be able to keep operating.  I'm sure we can find other ways the big ag corporations help the little ag producers. For example, on Molokai Monsanto (used to) do all the work to keep the Farmers' football field in good condition. They also dug the graves for departed Molokai residents. Also important, for Molokai at least, are the jobs Monsanto provided. Now that they've left, a lot of Molokai families are turning more and more to hunting, foraging, and gathering to feed themselves. This is great, yes, but there are serious doubts about whether Molokai's environment can handle this onslaught.  Just a few positives

While you believe there should be no outside cats at all, it’s not realistic. There are always going to be some outdoor cats. More people are keeping their cats inside now and that’s great ( hopefully they provide plenty of enrichment for them). People’s attitudes towards cats seem to be improving maybe thanks to cute cat videos.Increased cat spay neuter is the solution.

Only fluoridation opponents, who apparently have no understanding of the concept that any substance is toxic at high enough exposure levels, can seriously try to equate swallowing a tube of toothpaste with drinking several liters of optimally fluoridated water.

The coal mines were unprofitable and like all nationalised industries at the time were a burden on the taxpayer (I remember when there was a three month waiting list to have a phone line installed). It was Arthur Scargill who didn't give a damn about the miners, the strike was an attempt to bring down the democratically elected government. Would you approve of that? I know the Church doesn't live up to your expectations of it so you refer to the institutional Church to distinguish it from the church of John Hobson where you are your own pope and magisterium, you have said so on numerous occasions.

0,"Let's concentrate on life after birth. The newborn knows nothing, and has to be taught everything. It takes two or three decades to make a mature human, and there are no shortcuts. If the child's learning is neglected at an early age, it will result in a less than mature adult, with damage that likely will affect the rest of it's life. Unwanted children will grow into crippled adults, especially if they suffer early and constant mental or physical abuse. But who will decide whether both, or at least one, parent is fit for parenthood? Will Carol Grapf decide? No, it is the potential mother who must make the decision - would the fetus be born healthy into a world where it is not only loved but taught responsibly? No one can make that decision but the mother. Will the Carol Grapfs of the world insure that a newborn will be loved, nurtured and taught to be a mature human adult? No they will not.  The Carol Grapfs of the world feign compassion but when the chips are down, they leave town.

0,"I understand that land was taken away and this needs to be addressed. But I battle to understand how simply handing out land will solve the economic and social problems we have. If you are a poor and given a piece of land with the title deed, what then? You need to get financing from somewhere. The banks are unlikely to fund you unless you can show you are likely to be successful and repay your loan. If the government gives you funding and you cannot repay the loan, then effectively tax payers will be funding you for the rest of your life. Basically a social grant.  It seems to me that the only people who will win are politicians who will be able to boast about getting voters their land back. That will work for a short period, until the land recipients then ask for/demand money/seeds/tractors/etc.  Ultimately we need them to be successful farmers for this to work.  And what about urban areas?  The only answers I have seen are: Don't worry about what we will do, just give us the land.

Totally useless waste of police and court resources enforcing the current law.  As for taxation, I would suggest that it should be taxed just as liquor is currently taxed. That would be whatever the HST rate is in most provinces.  The GST plus PST in provinces that have a separate provincial sales tax (BC, Sask, Man. and Quebec, sort of), and 5% in Alberta, as they have no provincial sales tax. Simplicity is one advantage.  A separate rate for pot would just add complexity. And it would risk being so out of line that it would not undercut the illegal market. The price it is sold at is already completely out of line with producer costs (although that price could come down once the producers have recouped their initial investment and the market expands, and competitors come in)  The biggest problem for the provinces is how to distribute the product

For example, supporters do not debate the criminality of illegal immigration, but blame the president for pardoning Arpaio, an ad hominen attack that favors blaming the person instead of the fact of law. Another tactic employed ad nauseam by supporters of this ordinance is that illegals would """" . . . help police solve crimes . . . ."""" A fear tactic. In other words, without the assistance of illegals the police will be hampered or delayed in solving crimes? So, are we to believe that unless illegals are not on board to snitch we will be undermining public safety? So laughable.

I just got through explaining to a screaming 5 year old that the 7 year old will always do things and say things to you to make you cry and scream, or get mad because it always works.  That's what she wants.  For you to react.  It's called having power over you.

This will only improve the housing coverage of the CPI when it is included in that series. Since nothing has been published for it, it is still some way off. And it will do nothing to fix the problem of the CPI using new housing prices to proxy existing housing prices.

The only supporters I ridicule are the ones that emulate his behavior because wow, that's some serious mental health issues going on. Remember how Hitler got elected? Germany was not doing well and Hitler made them feel empowered even if that false feeling sunk the ship. Even if half their country laid in ruins and the whole world turned against them. False hope for some is better than none, false sense of self is sometimes better than staring at the mirror. These are the same people who lack personal responsibility and blame all their problems on the government or on black folk, Mexicans or on women, they can't take responsibility for themselves. Since Trump has the same problem perhaps it comforts them. Self reliance is key, in my bizarre thoughts, the only way to stop this countries destruction is to quit feeding the system!

Nixon's did.  And the president is not the final arbiter of what any law or regulation means.  The courts are the final arbiter of those facts.   Avoiding a disruption is not an excuse for violating the law.  What Bork did was not enforcing the law.  It was simply bailing out to keep a job. And RRDRRD when you are arguing that the president is above the law or that laws do not apply to the president or that the president is the final say on anything, then yes you are saying the president has the power of a king.  No straw argument there, just a reasonable conclusion to your argument.

When they demanded the money, he didn't have it, so they beat him, kidnapped him and brought him home to get his bank card and that's when this man pulled a gun on them. We should know what's going on in the valley, where we're raising our kids. All these boys were doing meth.  After realizing who one of the parents are, I'm sure her son is getting the drugs from her.  She was well informed of his addiction and tried to get him into treatment.  16 year olds have many more options.  Juvenile facilities, North Star, youth corp.

We bought the house two years ago and are losing a significant amount of money on it. It was not believed to be unreasonably priced. The central market is currently flooded with skinnies. As the developer mentioned, most people here want 2000+ sq.ft. and our house was considered too small (it is just under 2K), too skinny, etc. etc. by probably 40+ potential buyers. So I'm really unclear how much of a market there is for these uniquely designed homes that do not maximize floor space through the box design, but still cost as much. Particularly in these neighborhoods which are actually not very central at all.

If the Russians *weren't* doing this, they're the stupidest superpower in world history.  2. Clinton’s lawyers and aides deleted almost 30,000 emails – and wiped their hard drives – before turning the rest over to federal investigators. They claimed that these 30,000 were not work-related. (However, the investigators were able to recover some of the 30,000, and discovered that, yes, some of those were in fact work-related.)  3. Trump did not “ask” Russia to hack into Clinton’s email server. Trump (correctly) noted that they had almost certainly ALREADY hacked it, and was encouraging Russia to release the missing 30,000 emails.  4. Finally, hacking into an email server isn't the same as """"hacking the election,"""" which is your claim, above.

I'm now a part of UCC, where the ideas of Kung, Schillebeeckx, Chittister, et. al., can live and breathe, and where Pope Francis is admired as the leader of Christianity.

Her older brother had a different teacher earlier in the same school and told us that it seemed as though his Physics teacher didn't understand the material he was teaching.

This incident was made even worse when a separate news report detailed that Trump, indeed, had previously known about David Duke when Trump considered running as a Reform Party candidate, and David Duke was also a candidate in that party. And just yesterday, one of Trump's many tweets got him in more trouble when he re-tweeted a quote from Mussolini, the former fascist dictator of Italy during WWII. When Trump was asked by Chuck Todd of NBC News about why he would use a quote from Mussolini, Trump replied it didn't matter who said it because he liked the quote, that it was a good quote.

Oh, sure, very rich people can buy a sense of normality in such situations, but the more common scenario is the struggling single mom in the city struggling to put food on the table.

My contribution I think was up 25% of my gross income, but that was still usually in less than 10,000 dollars.  So if Rep have proposed that you can not defer more than say 100,000$ then I'm gonna be less resistant, that would affect vert few wage earners.  If you have the income to set aside $100,000 in a years times, I'd be pleased to say you have to pay your tax's on this year, not at withdrawal.  We need to return to tax systems that have a true moral component, which is why we had a progressive tax in the first place.   I simply have no concern for a family with $100,000 of discretionary income, having the 401tax deferral eliminated.  Found it:  I'm deeply opposed.  Wage earners lost pensions already, now they want this too?  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/us/politics/republicans-tax-401-k.html

We get it that sexual assault continues to be a serious problem. There are many reasons the conviction rate is lower than for other crimes - some of which are amenable to legislative reform and enhanced resources. Others less so.  By its very nature, sexual interaction between humans is among the most difficult things to police. Discerning the true circumstance and intent of that conduct is a genuine challenge to our justice system.  No doubt there's a need and opportunity for improvement - none of which McLachlin diminishes. But she does warn is that in our eagerness to empathize with victims, we cannot lower the bar for proving the elements of such a serious charge, nor can we in any way undermine the presumption of innocence.

When you look at the actual players and risk factors, and quit falsely generalizing data to the population at large (as epidemiologists are prone to do due to apparently not understanding criminality and ignoring the extant research by the actual experts on crime) you find that lawful ownership and carry has essentially no causal intersect with criminal misuse.

0,"There is no natural constituency for the things for which Rep. Buck advocates. No one wants a balanced budget if it comes on the backs of the poor and the vulnerable. Supply-side economics have been thoroughly discredited, because there's no obligation for the people/companies who have wealth to spend or invest it - they can simply sit on their money if they want to.  Buck's argument is that American government is insufficiently conservative. Three main reasons why Republicans control all three branches of government: (1) a poorly-educated base that is prone to inflammatory manipulation; (2) performance of such manipulation by craven right-wing media outlets; and (3) gerrymandering and voter suppression.  If Republicans actually succeed in enacting the agenda laid out by Buck, they will be the dog who caught the car, with the added bonus that the car will be popping into reverse right as they lock their jaws on it.

0,"I do love the """"calm down, you are being fooled by a clever prophet"""" attitude.  However, there is proof that it actually happened.  For one thing, the tomb was sealed and guards were posted.  During Roman times, if the Emperors seal was placed on anything, there was a penalty of death to open it.  No Jew would have been foolish enough to go steal the body.  For another, there were many recorded witnesses.  Third, when Peter and John arrived at the tomb after the women reported He was missing, John walked in and noticed that the burial clothes were folded and laid neatly.  He traveled with Jesus for three years so he knew His habits.  He knew Jesus was alive because of that bit of evidence.  Even though faith is the belief in the unseen, it doesn't hurt to back it up with facts.

In my opinion in lieu of definitive records the best solution is to gather as much market data relevant to the approximate periods that the shares would have been purchased.  Then calculate a reasonable estimate erring on the side of caution.  The key is be reasonable - the CRA isn't likely to spend a lot of time challenging a minor discrepancy and even if they do disagree it is unlikely that they will do more than assess interest on the outstanding tax owed.  Yes you are technically responsible for maintaining records but since that ship has sailed you need to do your best to remedy the situation.  Which is providing a reasonable estimate.

Bowers goes on to say: """"Tattersall is an example of everything wrong in this country when it comes to race relations"""" proposing that she misrepresent the facts. She is """"everything wrong""""? If it is that simple, it's good to know. Bowers uses some big words in a flashy way that look like he enjoys writing.

Since that report was the """"backbone"""" of their disciplinary procedure relating to the Shurtz incident, I would have thought it, properly, would have been part of her personnel record and, therefore, exempte from public disclosure.  In my opinion, the Administration chose to release it to publicly justify the extremely condemning comments from University President Schill.

0,"So here's the question arising from this situation as well as some of the other moves by Trump over the last week. What would the US do if a President refuses to abide by the rule of law as defined by the Constitution and prevailing law and Congress does not have the votes or inclination to impeach? We may very well find out over the next few weeks.  In any case, before our very eyes those things that we read about in history books is unfolding as the US sinks into the throes of dictatorship. Just as Hitler did in 1930s Germany, things start small and on the edge of legality and gradually move, with the full support of the populace, to a full fascist state.  Just as nearly all previous empires, it was bound to happen eventually.

I pay a high city tax on my food, fuel, and utilities. As a renter, I also contribute to the extra cost my landlord has to pay for fuel oil. There is no natural gas in rural Alaska. It is expensive to take trash to the dump. Food and fuel are very expensive as it is flown or barged in so there is a shipping surcharge added to the retail cost. The prices we pay to fly commercially include the fees our one flight service has to pay to the city and state in order to land here. Because the state no longer pays overtime for airport maintenance crews, our airport often closes early if planes cannot make scheduled arrivals due to weather. We have to pay the cost of staying in Anchorage until flights are rescheduled. We do not get cost of living raises to cover the expense of living here.

0,"You do realize that when you sell high, you also end up buying high in the market.  Housing plays a critical part in the lives of every citizen who lives in this country. As property taxes are now based on market value assessments, you can expect it to go up as the value of your property goes up.  Imagine how a senior on a fixed income is going to pay their property taxes just to stay in their homes.  They'd be forced to move out of their house.  Young families will have to secure a large mortgage just so they can buy a place to live.  Getting indebted for such a large amount of money and at a longer time is not a great way to start out.  Our governments need to be more cognizant of the tremendous effect that the cost of housing has on people's lives.  Housing should not be open to foreign speculative investors.  There are only downsides in the future.  It's already too late for the Vancouver market. People who bought high will not be willing to sell their house at a loss.

The connection is pretty clear: In short, unhealthy food is cheap; if a family's food budget is $100/person/mo, they have to take advantage of Taco Tuesday, dollar menus and processed foods. They also probably can't afford that gym membership or the gas to hike in the hills. Remember, class and status are strong determinants in life chances.

There are many  reports of attacks where the person shot an attacker  in the leg or arm, with a 22 cal. and it did not subdue the attacker.  The PROBLEM is the 22 cal. does NOT have the KNOCKDOWN Power that a 9mm, 40cal., 45 cal. does.  If you decide on a 22 cal.  buy a semi-auto.  And if  you ever have to use it, make sure you fire until you run out of bullets.   I am not a fan of Derringers even tho they are cute and deadly.

The question that needs to be asked is """"How much natural gas has been imported through that facility"""". The answer is """"None"""".  In effect we hired Meyer who oversaw a failed project to guide our project and tell us it will work. Chenier has spent a lot of money to convert the facility to now EXPORT natural gas. Glad Peter Micciche identified this failure.  The market changed, just as it did for Palin's LNG Pipeline . Times have changed for Alaska LNG as well.  A couple of years ago Asia LNG was upwards of $16 per million BTU, now it is approximately $4 per million BTU.  Much less than our cost to get LNG there.

0,"Thanks @scottd for the Macleans link. About a year or so back they also did a very good expose on the Vancouver market.  I think the GTA market is being driven more so by local speculation that what we saw in Vancouver.   The 15% Vancouver tax may have given the Toronto market a push,  but there were lots of lessons to be had from the west coast in terms of speculation, profiteering, and   flipping.  Houses here are still more expensive than in Toronto, and anyone not buying in at a million soon had the spectre of 1.5 million looming in front of them.Then two million.  People who sat on the sidelines here forever lost their chance at owning a house.  And they now have a rental vacancy rate of well under one percent to deal with, on top of escalating rents.  Those Vancouver lessons are no doubt also driving the GTA market.

That's seven zeroes, and equals your likelihood of being killed by a piece of your own furniture.  Your odds of dying in a car crash, however, are 1 in 100.  http://www.lifeinsurancequotes.org/additional-resources/deadly-statistics/  By your thinking, we need to keep both foreigners and furniture out of the country because they present too much of a threat to our lives.

But all the analogies to Trump's stumbles in the campaign, which never ended up undoing him despite so many predictions they would, are missing a basic point I think. Trump won't be able to run against 'the establishment' after 4 yrs as president if he hasn't gotten major things done, whether with or despite 'the establishment'. And the constant chaos is eroding his ability to get things done. Even if some of the chaos is the creation of 'Fake News', Trump is almost always complicit by taking the bait, his third try on Charlottesville being an example.

Yet, he only gave him 10 days in jail, and 2 years of probation.  Worst of all, is that he allowed him to keep his guns.   Judge Merten could have easily taken Centano's guns away during his probationary period of 2 years.   Centano would then have never had a gun this week, and this shooting would have never happened.  Judge Merten is incompetent as a judge, as far as I am concerned, for allowing Centano to keep his guns.  The government needs to start seizing the guns of people who show violent tendencies like Centano clearly did.  And Judge Merten could have easily done that,  We really need to have Judge Maurice Merten recalled and removed from office.  He is so very old.  He has been a judge since 1975!!   His thinking is clearly impaired.  Perhaps we need to pass a new mandatory retirement age for judges too.

A wider trade war promises even more pain for the farm belt, because unlike manufacturing where exports can be displaced in the domestic market, it's not like the US domestic market can absorb a large amount of already subsidized agricultural exports. People only eat so much. So there is the soft political underbelly. Canada can turn to other markets to supply foodstuff. Maybe we'll even get our ketchup-making branch plants back.

If you're at a higher risk of getting into a car accident and incurring costs within the """"pool"""",  your premium is higher.  If you're at a higher risk of getting sick and incurring costs within the """"pool"""", your premium should be higher.  I think lots of the arguments on healthcare boil down to certain people believing healthcare is a basic human right versus a commodity. And others believing that the finest healthcare available is a basic human right.  But declaring excellent healthcare a basic human right would be massively expensive - requiring enormous government subsidies. Not too different from declaring Ferrari's is a basic human right. I think low-level, very basic, very cheap healthcare should be a part of the social safety net. But that's it. There's just not enough money for much more.

0,"On the other hand, it must be understood that child sexual abuse is a heinous crime - and in most jurisdictions is a grave civil crime - for which there are severe penalties. The Vatican is a signatory to a number of international conventions including the Convention against Torture that states child abuse is a form of torture due to its degrading, cruel and punitive nature. If the Vatican wants credibility within this world, child abuse by clerics does have to be met with appropriate punishments. God may be Merciful to the soul of the abuser when it come to the Judgement and the Church can counsel the abuser in the spiritual domain. However, the Church should not provide a lesser punishment to a priest who has abused children than that which prevails in the civil legal jurisdictions of this world. Abuse is a crime before both God and man. Christ said, """"Suffer not little children to come unto me"""". There is an imperative there that places the child uniquely within Christ's protection.

If we have put on Christ there is NO reason we cannot serve our fellow Community members. As Paul said no longer male nor female....all one in Christ. Our religion has an unfortunate history of holding on to the Gnostic and Stoic cultures of the past. These philosophical ideas infected our church's history and have held women in a place of religious inequality. God does not play gender favorites.

0,"Mr. Vettesse, find a few older colleagues and ask them what trust companies would have needed to fund a DB plan like the PSSA in 1990. The answer is about 7%, which is and has always been the employee contribution alone. When currently retiring public servants were beginning their careers, they funded their entire pension. The employer got a free ride. This is easily verifiable because Paul Marting and the Liberals sucked $30 billion out of the fund in the early 1990's, over union objections, because there was a huge actuarial surplus. The unions thought some of that surplus should go to the members who had contributed, but the government took it all. So now the government owns the shortfall. And it's specious to say that a DC plan would """"save"""" $X over a DB one. Either plan would require the same funding to pay the same benefit. The """"savings"""" are just funding shortfalls, not even a risk transfer, which is the aspect you tout. The risk transfer assumes equal funding.

This is especially critical now that Alaska voter registration is linked to the PFD and updated to show accurate data which makes Alaska's lists even more valuable.  I would not give up the franchise; however, cancelling your voter registration is the only way you can stop the sale (and giveaway in this case)  of your voter registration information by the State of Alaska to anyone willing to purchase it. Ever wonder how all the political and other junk mail finds it way to your home?  There can be a more sinister use of this information.  For example, my home address was published on this forum by a upset legislative aide and when I challenged him he said he used his personal copy of Alaska's voter registration list and there was nothing I could do. .

0,"Blake, I'm more than happy to discuss these issues.  First of all, you're right, we would certainly prefer if HART or the City were developing dedicated renewable electricity production to power the rail system. But ultimately, as you may be aware, we fought for many years to get the 100% RPS standard by 2045 passed two years ago.  No matter where the rail system gets it power, whether purchased from HECO, or HART owned power generating facilities; we are 100% confident it will be 100% renewable by 2045 at the latest. Secondly, the City and County of Honolulu has no way to significantly add public transit capacity without building the rail system. TheBus has been at-capacity since the early 1980's due to the phenomenon called """"bus bunching"""".  It's too technical to explain in detail here, but to summarize Honolulu's narrow geography squeezes too many buses onto too few major east-west roadways and the buses are getting backed up behind each other. Buses average 4-8mph in urban Honolulu.

Therefore receiving CPP for 25 years. Age 60 - $257,219 (starting payment at $713.07/month) Age 65 - $333,007 (starting payment at $1,114.07/month) Age 70 - $316,710 (starting payment at $1,582.12/month) To me - the differences of $75,788 (333,007-257,219) and $59,491 (316,710-257,219) over 25 years is not worth the risk of dying early and forgoing your money.

This approach does not solve the issue of poverty OR lack of home ownership for those experiencing poverty: it, in fact, perpetuates it. While there may be some benefits to borrower/buyer/RENTER such as having a mortgage loan on their credit, the land owner benefits FAR more at the expense of that tenant.

0,"Thanks for this, Elton. The study you linked to provides a pretty good overview of factors affecting voter turnout. Among the factors which may help explain Hawaii's low turnout is the absence of competitive races, with the presidential race at the top, but also in down-ticket races.  BTW, I suspect the figure they gave for HI turnout is based upon faulty methodology which includes a count of non-resident military personnel, 99% of whom are registered to vote in other states.  Nonetheless, Hawaii has a very low turnout rate. We also are the only state with zero members of the minority party in one of our chambers. Our elections are not competitive. Few people want to vote for Republicans. Voters prefer Democrats, yet that does not produce laws which deliver on the Democratic platform's commitment to working and middle class voters. To paraphrase a bumpersticker, """"Why Vote? It only encourages them.""""  Maybe if voting seemed to make a difference, there's be more of it?

Clericalism from my view is not in the clothing, liturgical appointments or the titles a priest goes by.  I don't care if Father likes prancing around in a cassock, French Cuffs, etc--as long as he gets his behind out of bed at 2AM when the hospital calls.  Conversely, I don't care if """"Call me Joe"""" thinks the year is a perpetual 1970 and never got over the 70's. What matters is how hard the priest works and how he serves and treats the people.  If """"Father Doe"""" and """"Call me Joe"""" serve the people and are willing to get over their ideology to do it, (when possible) they are good priests.

0,"I have been heartened by the Mayor and City Council's awareness of the critical need for additional parks funding, and the allocation of $2 million more funding per year in the current 2017-18 budget. However, I have been dismayed to see banked property tax identified as the solution. It is not only a new tax for residents but inadequate as a long-term solution for funding parks. As Council President Boyce suggests, it has already been identified as the solution to the coming “fiscal cliff.” Further, the City of Kent Parks and Recreation Commission believes that it is the City’s obligation to maintain parks’ current level of service within existing City revenues. It is, in my opinion, and the opinion of the Commission, unfair that residents would have to pay more taxes just to maintain current parks level of service. Current tax dollars should rightly fund our current obligations. Voters should decide whether to increase level of service and fund new programming citywide.

0,"I have a problem with """"nighttime driving"""" being a measure of good/bad drivers. We have one of these devices in each of our cars (Not Nationwide) & while hard braking, fast acceleration & nighttime driving are somewhat* valid measures of accident risk, nighttime driving is a silly measure for the purpose of this article. Getting off work at 12pm (which my son does) does not mean he's a bad driver, it means he drives at a time of day that has a higher risk of accidents. Despite almost 25% of his driving is between 12 & 4 am (the metric used), he's getting the best discount of all of us.  *Which brings me to my next point - if you are a freeway commuter & must travel at rush hour, guess what? You will have quite a few rapid accelerations recorded because that's what the metered ramps require you to do. Go from stop to merge with 55-65 mph traffic quickly.  When some idiot suddenly changes lanes without signaling, you'll brake hard because YOU'RE a good driver reacting for safety.

0,"The climate has changed since 1979. Fire seasons are longer, summers hotter and drier, and there are more dead trees because pests don't die off in the warmers winters.  Too many years of unregulated timber harvests are one reason for the man-made climate change. Healthy forests are significant repositories, or """"carbon sinks"""", for atmospheric CO2. They store it in roots and trunks, balancing out what they give off in winter with what they take in during the summer.  A replanted tree plantation, no matter how well regulated by the logging industry, is not as effective as an actual forest in doing this, largely because of a forest's greater biodiversity.

0,"Although there are no hard statistics for the number of abortions before Roe, in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court legalized abortion-on-demand nationwide, there were 24 deaths from legal abortions and 39 from illegal abortions (according to the Centers for Disease Control Abortion Surveillance, Annual Summary, 1978).  In 1973, the year Roe legalized abortions in all states, the number of abortions was roughly 615,000.  The number doubled in 1974 and nearly tripled by the 1990's.  That huge increase is a direct result of legalization.  Although the number of abortions has decreased to just over 1 million per year in recent years, to suggest that legal abortion is the cause is nonsensical and preposterous on its face, especially when studies show that a growing percentage of the population self-identifies as pro-life, and the science of embryology has unmasked the deceitful claims of pro-abortionists who to this day describe an unborn as just """"a clump of cells"""".

Mr. Nieuwenhuis is undoubtedly familiar with the East Bellevue Community Council’s - and hence the City’s - legal case against the PSE proposal in EBCC’s jurisdiction. I appreciate the Bellevue City Council’s recent decision to allocate funds to challenge PSE in the Washington Supreme Court. I understand Councilman Wallace’s objections to funding the EBCC’s legal challenge.  Given this highly complex and large-scope issue, I am wondering about Mr. Nieuwenhuis view in regards to Energize Eastside.

Indian soldiers, from India,  a nation of hundreds of millions of people with their own commerations and events were more important to publicize than Canadians? Believe me, India doesn't remember or commerate the sacrifices of Canadians or Canada. Nobody else in the world remembers the sacrifices of Canadians but Canadians.

After condemning the haters and lawlessness he didn't want to talk about the alt-right or how there was an illegal torchlit parade the night before or the likely motive and background of the man arrested for murder of an anti-protester.  All he wanted to talk about was violence and some counter-extremist """"alt-left"""" as if regular people couldn't be a counter-protester.

Because the article notes that the ECB is *STILL* running in stimulus mode, even if they are trimming it back a hair.  In fact all the major central banks around the world are working in full-on stimulus mode throughout this entire economic cycle.  So what are they going to do when the NEXT recession hits?

Pulp is pretty dead - Ocean Falls B.C. and  Skeena Cellulose pulp are examples. The Americans regard any refusal to ship them raw logs as a type of illegal subsidy. Mostly though, any modern economy tends to grow services, and we in  Canada also adopted the open trade ideology, which caused a lot of lost manufacturing jobs. That pushed resource exports up as a portion of GDP but not enough to keep up with the services growth. Exports peaked at 46% of GDP in 2000 and have since dropped back to around 31% while median incomes have risen slightly. Less trade, imports and exports as a percent of GDP,  roughly correlates with higher real median incomes.  Those same incomes dropped in the 1980's and 1990's as trade rose. Diminishing trade is a good thing.

I can think of 'boomer' parents who lost their jobs in the 1990s -- which surprised us kids at school because that was a new phenomenon when contract and temporary work followed 'permanent lay-offs'.  Now, it is the norm to work contracts -- sporadic temporary and part-time work is everywhere.  The concept of full-time retirement at 65 began in the early 1960s, but it was a politically-hyped 'promise'.  Surely, no one believed such retirement was possible in the absence of disciplined personal saving ...? Politicians continue to pretend they can control society -- we see rising debt/deficits and disappearing jobs. Political promises & spending. Unaffordable, unsustainable.

0,"National Popular Vote is a nonpartisan coalition of legislators, scholars, constitutionalists and grassroots volunteers committed to preserving the Electoral College, while guaranteeing the presidency to the candidate who earns the most votes among all fifty states.  The bill was approved in 2016 by a unanimous bipartisan House committee vote in both Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Missouri (10).  In 2016 the Arizona House of Representatives passed the bill 40-16-4. Two-thirds of the Republicans and two-thirds of the Democrats in the Arizona House of Representatives sponsored the bill. In January 2016, two-thirds of the Arizona Senate sponsored the bill.  In 2014, the Oklahoma Senate passed the bill by a 28–18 margin.

Shame on you, Jen, for accusing our local people of not caring about cops who are killed by criminal acts, even when the criminal is insane.  Further shame on you for stating that this protest focussed on criminals. The overwhelming majority of black people killed in the US by police, including the ones whose recent homicides have been inspiring protests all over this nation, were not committing any crimes when they were gunned down.  Now, about people employed in law enforcement risking their lives: More citizens are being killed by cops, often unlawfully, than cops are being killed by citizens. The fact is, cops take an oath to risk their lives for the citizenry and are paid accordingly. We don't take any oath to die for them.

However, we both grew up in Adventist ghettos in the 1970s.  But we are the only generation that did, even though we are both sixth generation Adventists. The effect of the full immersion in Adventist life was so strong that I had a hard time considering any other way of life.  When I found myself at 30 living in a small town with few SDA connections for the first time in my life, it took years to feel normal.  I now spend little time with my Adventist friends and most of my time is spent with those who don't care what my religious background is.  They know, because I don't think people forget that kind of thing once they learn it, but we rarely, if ever, talk about it. But I know that I could go right back--the ghetto is still there where I left it.  A little different perhaps, but largely intact.

That people were so disenfranchised with Obama, so repulsed by Hillary, that they elected the unelectable.  Is a stunning indictment of the state of liberalism in the US.  Time to put the knives away, time for liberals to grow up and put the big boy pants on and recognize that it's folly to continue to wish ill will on Trump for his electoral drubbing of Hillary.  The election was HRC's to lose, and she lost fair and square.  Hard fought and fairly won for Trump.

It must be terrible when your thoughts about government policy do not align with the majority of voters, but that's the way it is in democracy.  Look at states where the politics are not like Oregon, states like Kansas, Texas, etc., is Stephen Aloia saying there is tyranny in these states. Maybe he would be happier in states where the tyranny works with his leaning.  The voters have spoken so many times in Oregon. It's easy to blame the media, however, they did publish his opinion.

Presidents pardon people for political reasons all the time -- Clinton, for example, pardoned a number of very shady characters -- and giving Arpaio a get-out-of-jail-free card is hardly much of a stretch.

Not find a way to work with Obama on getting people back to work, continue to pull the economy out of the sinkhole that Obama inherited from...Bush; or find ways to lighten the load for the middle class...or small businesses. No.The only vision from the party that now has the run of Washington was to say no...for 8 years.""""

0,"'The love of money is the root of all evil' is a cliche, but certainly describes the ethos of 21st Century business, more so than in mid-20th Century America.  People like Tillerson, Ross and Mnunsen, and yes, Trump,  hold allegiance to money more than to citizenship, which explains their attraction to Putin.  Their love of money takes precedence over ethics.  Lying about their connections to Russia is the proof of it.

0,"When Paul wrote, faith was really faith in Jesus and his preached message.  There was no dogma, had been no Church Councils (save the first at Jerusalem).  The Curia did not exist and people were beginning to explore for themselves what faith meant.  Most importantly, a social gospel was much more important than a strict pelvic morality and there was no hierarchy that insisted on loyalty.  The reason we enter new life, by the way, is to be free from sin - not for God's sake but for our own.  It is a gift to us, not a requirement for us.  Morality is the ultimate therapy.  Pastors should be involved, but they must be freer to challenge some of the teaching which is, inf fact, wrong.  Gay people should end promiscuity and find a spouse appropriate to them - that is the moral course - not assuming that all gay sexuality is anathema (which it is not, if you are gay - especially if you are a gay priest).  This does lead to Christ, whose yoke is easy and his burden, light.

0,"Those wars were all going on before Obama was President and Presidents before him could not stop them. The problem is that the wars cannot be ended militarily. Iraq and Afghanistan are examples-- after years of fighting, thousands of bombs and missiles, we took back land and defeated enemy fighters-- with a surge of 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan. We thought those wars were over. Except for leaving a total of less that 15,000 troops in those two countries, we withdrew. We are training Iraqi forces and they have become good fighters in Syria against ISIS-- but more US troops are needed. In Afghanistan after a surge in Obama's second term of 100,000 US plus another 40,000 Nato and US allied troops we defeated the Taliban, and supported a government. But the Taliban (with Russian assistance), Al Quaeda, and ISIS are on the rise and our small force is not enough to stop them. These wars do not end militarily-- aid, development, and local political leadership are needed.

0,"Framing our options as up or out continues the divisive nature of discourse regarding development.  The choices are not, and cannot, be binary.  There are too many unintended consequences for our community to simply choose one or the other.  I had been involved in several subdivisions, planned unit developments, in Eugene.  What struck me was the requirements for conservation, and lack of requirements for commercialization.  In other words, 40 acres in the southeast hills was developed without a single fire station, access to EMS or a grocery store.  Compare that with the prior Edgewood development which provided for schools and commercial stores and a neighborhood pool in the midst of Donald Street and Willamette Street.  The rate of exchange of single family homes for student housing was, I believe, an unintended consequence of a tax policy.  Eugene must consider both up and out, and the out must include creation of new multi-dimensional neighborhoods with local resources and jobs.

Both of these have a vested interest in not full disclosure as it lets them paint Trump as the bad guy.  But we don't know this for sure and pretending we do is ignorant and misleading.

Any rural district superintendent must do several jobs and rapidly change from one duty to another.  An unseen part of the job is the intensely personal interactions that occur within that small school district setting where community members, students, and parents have much greater access to the superintendent, which sometimes but not always, a lightening rod for district and community.

Never mind the treaties that obligate us to provide ( housing, education, food, health care ... ) whatever - to compensate them for their land claims.

0,"It's so incredibly disturbing to see the Democrat party faithfuls' blindness to the fact that the US policy of interventionist wars of regime-change is not beneficial to civilians and countries!! It's as if black has become white and white has become black. These Democratic leaders are now pushing for regime-change in Syria based upon propaganda and lies — the Democratic version of WMD.  Just see! Prominent long time-Democrats in leadership positions are actively supporting US efforts to oust a non-enemy of the USA (Assad) and actively condoning the arming the US enemy — ISIS and al Qaeda and the terrorist militias who train with, fight with and support — to help them do it. This is Iraq all over again! Where is the outrage?? It was there with Bush and fake WMD, but instead of """"just"""" advocating the regime-change in Syria, they are attacking Tulsi because she's actively trying to end that war which is unauthorized and has caused so many unnecessary deaths and a massive refugee crisis.

0,"“A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.” ~Marcus Tullius Cicero, 63 BC in The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero

Especially when the cut-off for being sneeringly referred to as wealthy is probably less than those two politicians earn in dividends in a month.  I am heartily tired of self interested politicians defining “wealthy”as a moderate level of income that in at least two cities in this country is barely sufficient for a family.  Wealth is not a measure of income.

0,"I pretty much agree with you, as far as there are multiple reasons for why gay men are attracted to the priesthood.   Without listing them, many of the reasons are no doubt linked to cultural displacement, but some are linked to more feminine traits of empathy and aesthetics (if that sounds very un-PC, it's still true.   How many male fashion designers are straight?)  The general problem with gay priests isn't theological or speculative, it's been proven out with the sex abuse scandal.   It can't be an accident that 4 out 5 five of these crimes were committed by gay men.   That fact doesn't mean that gay men must not become priests, but at the very least,  it's time they were Out about their orientation.   It's time to end the policy allowing (actually, forcing) gay priests to pretend they are straight.

0,"We can sell our stock if we can get 75% of shareholders to agree. The problem is only 59% of shareholders vote. Resolutions normally require 50% plus 1 of ALL shareholders to agree. Sealaska couldn't get those numbers itself, even with the 150k they earmarked to elect they're slate. What did Sealaska do? They lobbied Congress for a stipulation where 50% plus 1 of VOTING shareholders could pass a resolution. Sealaska spent 1.5 million dollars on a campaign to get 25% plus 1 to agree. This was done after shareholders turned down new shareholders in two Sealaska surveys. After new shareholders were included, minus 7(i) funds, they are lucky to see 30 cents per day in dividends. Resolutions returned to the impossible 50% plus 1 approval. With discretionary voting where the unused votes are left to the board discretion, homeless and lost shareholders are used by management to control the shareholders and the stock. The solution is ANCSA election reform. One person one vote, no proxies.
