0,"The """"oligarchy"""" is experiencing their ultimate wet dream.  Someone that has promised to cut taxes for the ultra-rich and eliminate inheritance taxes.  Fact is, everyone I know that voted for Trump (or at least who will admit to it) has been adamant that they did so because of taxes.  They were willing to overlook everything else for that single reason.

0,"Trump's stated policies are to end illegal immigration and keep legal immigration """"within historic norms"""" after ensuring jobs are offered to Americans first.  That's his prerogative and one of the reasons he was elected so I expect he will do it.  But the author's point is that, with the American birth rate dropping below historic norms, keeping US immigration at historic norms while excluding all illegal immigration means the American work force is likely going to shrink (or at least experience negative growth).  That will be a negative driver on economic growth.

0,"all good points.  The ludicrous tax bill which hurts the middle class is dead on arrival though.  Few support it as it is written.  Lousy job by trump.

0,"It is a far different time and  time for common sense to make a comeback. That has been lacking for many, many years. Liberals and political correctness has made a mess of what once was a great nation. The election of Donald Trump was a turning point. It is a defining moment in history....and you are witnessing it. You can hang your head and pout or join Americans in rejoicing....its a choice.

0,"Trump: I still have 2 investigators in Hawaii looking into Obama’s birth certificate, and what they’ve found is UNBELIEVABLE.

Trump: Mexico will pay for the wall.  Trump: I am not Putin's puppet.

0,"As immigrant, I am always amazed at how USA citizens do not seem to understand, or perhaps I say do not know, and understand Constitution. Constitution is incredibly fair minded. Also, that people do not understand that USA is a Republic with limited democracy for the good of all, and not full democracy where all are not represented equally. Hard for liberals to understand (because they don't want to understand and accept) but our Republic form of government (not full democracy) also keep minorities from being unfairly treated. This is why electoral college is god and fair. Funny... both political parties do not like it when is goes against them. Trump was complaining about it, until he won. GOP and Nixon did not like it when he won popular vote but Democrats and JFK won electoral vote so they liked it.

"
0,"Nonsense. The more the Leftist Fake News Media hate on Trump the more grassroots conservative support he gets (enemy of our enemy as it were)--and grassroots TEA Party type conservatives have kept the GOP in the majority and elected Donald Trump president as well.

0,"Because the Church (rightly) supported Trump's opposition to abortion - and saw this as a priority - does not mean she will support his position on immigration deportation or his other policies. Why would it? As a Catholic, it's possible to be conservative on moral issues and more liberal on social issues.

Unless his """"date"""" was made aware that he was recording their conversation, I believe this is a violation of the law in Oregon.  This guy, like oh so many employed at EPD, is just trouble. I'm glad Kerns is finally retiring, but I fear the city will hire from within, which, difficult at that may be, will make it worse.  By the way, while the Trump team is making stuff up about NYC having an out of control murder rate, in spite of the fact that NYC had the fewest murders in history last year and is down further this year, Eugene is having an epidemic of murder. Historically, we have about one per year. The past three years have seen an average of almost six. Wowza! We need to clean house at EPD.

0,"Wounded vets, Olympic hopefuls will be blocked from Potomac river training each time Trump golfs:   Donald Trump spends nearly every moment of his free time doing one of three things—watching cable news; tweeting about his growing list of failures, trying to pin the blame on someone, anyone other than the man in the Oval Office; and last, but not least, golf. In fact, in only the first six months of office, Trump has taken 38 different golf outings, every single one of them to Trump-owned properties.  The closest Trump-owned golf course is roughly 30 miles from the White House, located in Potomac Falls, Virginia. The Coast Guard, in conjunction with the Secret Service, now plan to close a two-mile stretch of the Potomac River near Trump’s golf course whenever Donald Trump or other undisclosed “high ranking government officials” are golfing. This particular segment of the Potomac River is extremely popular with families, Olympic hopefuls and veterans who train and recover on the river.

0,"(Sarcasm alert). I've always found that tolerating bullies and bigots is the way to go. That's why our hate laws have had no effect protecting minorities and religious groups. And one person's sexual predator is another man's Donald Trump. You could be denying the world of it's next Dear Leader.

0,"Although I strongly disagree with a majority of Liberal positions, it is inevitable that leadership within our country will alternate between the Liberal and Conservative parties. I accept the fact that approx. 50% of the time, my national leader will be someone who holds views that I disagree with in the majority.  By choosing Trudeau as their leader, when there were numerous solid and reasonable alternatives such as, say, Marc Garneau or Ken Dryden, the Liberals did the equivalent in the cringe-worthy department as the GOP did with Trump.  Dear Liberals, for the good of the country....when it comes time for a Leadership review....please chose an adult next time.
"
0,"I do agree that this meeting is not technically or legally treason (the U.S. must be at war with said country), though it is certainly illegal. One might make a moral case for a treasonous act as being against the interests of your country though.  I also agree that will take a Democratic Congress to impeach Trump. That says something pretty telling about the blinders on your side, no?  As others have suggested, the last two paragraphs here are absurd. As if the Republicans, """"the party of no,"""" have anything to say about obstructionism.

0,"Trump voters are bunch of rubes, easily swayed by his sophomoric slogans...make America great again, build the wall.  Basically the people that think they're gonna win the lottery.

"
0,"No, my implication is that LBJ was right when he said the War on Poverty would """"have those n....s voting Democrat for the next 200 years.""""  Prior to 1965, most blacks voted Republican.  It was a brilliant political gambit.  Hispanics are much more likely than blacks to vote GOP -- Bush43 got 46% of the Hispanic vote -- but Trump's harsh rhetoric against illegals from Mexico reduced his percentage of the Hispanic vote to only about 26%.  A much lower % of Hispanics are on welfare, but most of them have friends, relatives, co-workers, and fellow church goers who are undocumented and don't want to see them deported.  I'm trying to convinced the GOP that if they treat the Hispanics fairly with Immigration Reform that gives the illegals legal status and way to stay, they'll get the majority of the Hispanic vote """"for the next 200 years"""" and turn the demographic trend in their favor.  Hispanics tend to be family-oriented, religious, hard-working, and have large families, naturals for the GOP.
"
0,"Yes, this explains why Obama's job approval rating right now is 57%. And why Trump's favorability rating is at 40%. And why a pre-election poll right before the election showed that Obama would have beaten Trump handily. Because most hope has vanished.  Facts are stubborn things. But as Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said, """"you're entitled to your own opinion,  but you're not entitled to your own facts."""" To be frank and to be honest, too many of Michael Sean Winters' columns are too light on data analysis. They read like someone more committed to """"truthiness"""" than to looking at and analyzing data objectively. It gets very old after awhile. NCR can and should do better.
"
1,"Your ignorance knows no boundaries. Sexual assault is unwanted touching, including groping. Donald, Trump has stated that he has done just that and that he just can. In order for there to be a conviction, someone would have had to press charges with a law enforcement agency. These women did not do that. There is a woman who stated that Trump raped her when she was 13-years-old. The statute of limitations would probably prevent criminal charges.
"
0,"Hmm, couple of thoughts- 1)Why so many letters from 97405-- these tend to be the folks who still believe in the possibility  of good government--  they're less alienated, they are more willing to take part in civic activities, work to make it better, vote, take part in city committees, write letters, etc. 2) Try comparing the blogging activity here on  Civil Comments to the letters that originate in print and I'd say you get a much higher percent of pro-Trumpers here, especially among the anonymous.  I don't know the meaning of this. 3) The result is, I believe , a more active, even dialogue  here, with both sides, or all sides, forced to defend their views against various attacks.  While some of the stuff posted here is pretty stupid or nasty, there are some serious, useful   debates.  And it's instant-- by the time some of these letters appear in print they'll already have been well  commented on here. And happily  probably 100% instead of 32% of my writing will be posted.

0,"Is the Justice Department running interference for Donald Trump, NO.  Is the Justice Department running interference for Hillary Clinton, YES. Why did the Justice Department grant immunity to so many Hillary players?  Why didn't the Justice Department promise to destroy key player laptops thus destroying key evidence?  Fortunately the FBI never destroyed the laptops. With all the evidence and information gathered  by the FBI, why hasn't a Grand Jury been convened? It's the Justice Department, not the FBI that are keeping Hillary from fraud and racketeering charges.  The same Department head (Attorney General Loretta Lynch) whom met privately with William Clinton on the Phoenix airport tarmac. Corruption written all over the CLINTON name, and now, all over this country's justice system.
"
0,"Comey called Rosenstein “a very independent-minded, career-oriented person”,   This is not a positive comment.  Career-oriented translates to me as ambitious.  Were I Rosenstein (a Jew presumably despite Trump's alleged antisemitism), I would have been pissed.  The democrats are desperate to make political hay out of the Comey matter, but the action may very well stem from a strong dislike between Rosenstein and Comey.

"
0,"The Iraq War and preemptive strike created a global schism known as Armageddon, which is not the end of the world, but the end of this cycle. It started the World Peace Movement. Every movement separates the people into four segments. The first segment to come in are those who stand on the principles, the second segment comes in when they are financially affected. In regards to the American Revolution Movement, John Adams and Sam Adams stood on the principles, but it wasn't until he was financially affected that Hamilton came in. He grabbed for power because they equate money and power. The second segment resorts to playing power games. Nikki Haley and those who see her as being a great ambassador do so because they are standing on the power games, not the principles. There is no judgment. The problem is that there is always a backlash to the games, because they go against Universal Law, so let's wait and see what occurs as the result of this power grab. Will Trump lose all his money?

0,"Water runs downhill.  The law requires X-number of Secret Service per family member wherever they are and no matter what political party they are.  Obama's trip to take his family to Machu Picchu last week cost the taxpayers millions.  Whether it's Obama's quick trip to take his daughters to  New York City in July 2015 for the weekend (They went to see """"Hamilton"""", of course), or Trump's drive to 21 from the Trump Tower, That's Just the Way it is.  Secret Service will be there.  And for Obama and family for a long time (for his and Michelle's life, the kids less).  What makes you think the taxpayers are on the hook for any lawsuits?  Do you have a reliable source for """"75 lawsuits""""?  Pelosi used Air Force One as a commuter airline between Washington DC and San Francisco when she was the Speaker of  the House of Representatives.  Does that inflame you passions and concerns for the 'childrun' who could have had their 'education improved'?

1,"While margaret sanger believed in eugenics, her approach was recognized as not being specific to race.  She believed in the importance of birth control for both white and black women as the only practical way to avoid unplanned pregnancies and subsequent abortions.  Unfortunately for women, religious conservatives oppose both contraceptives and abortions.  Their only solution seems to be to tell women to cross their legs.  Or, in the case of republican congressman tim murphy, hypocritically oppose abortion for everyone else but encourage his mistress to get one when he thought she was pregnant.  Meanwhile, religious conservatives have gotten into bed with the devil when they supported the thrice married, pu**y-grabbing, misogynistic trump.  Sad!

Trump has not failed as a leader.  His style is different; more like  other successful executives.  After the last 8 rudderless years, the U.S. needs leadership at home and abroad.

1,"“Trump encourages Russia to spy on Clinton”  No. People are being mislead by terrible journalism.  1. If Russia is not already spying on the secretary of state of their largest geopolitical rival, then they are the stupidest superpower in world history. They don’t need Trump’s “encouragement.”  2. Trump is not “encouraging” Russia to hack into Clinton’s email server. Trump is (correctly) noting that they have almost certainly already hacked it and is encouraging Russia to release what they found.  3. Clinton’s lawyers and aides deleted almost 30,000 emails – and wiped their hard drives – before turning the rest over to investigators. They claimed that these 30,000 were not work-related. However, FBI investigators were able to recover some of the 30,000, and discovered that, yes, some of them were in fact work-related.  4. So that is what Trump is saying: Hopefully, Russia will produce what Clinton’s team deleted.  5. I despise Trump. For the record.

And at the end of the project, where's the savings? The wall will still need to be patrolled, the US economy will suffer because fewer low-wage labourers will be harvesting crops, doing construction and cleaning houses etc...etc...

Reading some of these coments on this article, and others really makes me wonder how many postings are from this contracted team, or legislators themselves trying to sell their agenda on these comment boards. Once the government gets into the PFD it is gone like Social Security Fund poof! Once tax is started it will only increase. Once property tax exemptions are eliminated elderly and disabled veterans may loose thier homes. The most disgusting coment I have read is """"get out"""". Seems to be the republican catch phrase of late from Trump, to Gattis, to comments on these boards.

0,"GOP obstructionism. What a joke. If only. The reason Trump exists politically is the republican base has given up on the broken promises of a republican establishment that promises a conservative agenda at election time and then represents the status quo when they get there. When they were swept into congress in landslide 2010 & 2014 elections, republican voters stood by in stunned disbelief as republican leadership funded virtually every major Obama initiative. They gave the weak argument that they would be blamed for shutting down the government despite those landslides. 2014 was immediately after a shutdown.  Meanwhile we have a President that would have no problem shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood funding. With the possible exception of the Supreme Court nomination (during An election year) there has been no discernible difference between Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell. Trump is nothing more than chemotherapy for the cancer that is both parties.

If you want to win, hire someone else.  Such is the naivete of the right-wing legal community (all the way up to Scalia).  People who live by the shore in poor countries are poor and will die in flooding.  U.S. beach goers are richer and can live with plan B.  The same is true with property in fire zones.  In the U.S., warming triggers an insurance payout.  In Asia and Oceana, it means death.  The question is whether suburban Atlanta is looking like the Northern Virginia suburbs and how embarrassed people are about Trump.  Abortion was not an issue here, so it portends nothing to 2018, although the redistricting case may have more to say about that election than this race.

I still think he is clueless and got elected for a variety of reasons: it was the perfect storm with the Dems putting up a weak candidate coupled with the Russian involvement, Comey's ill timed email disclosure and eight years of propaganda fueled by the Repubs.  Examples of a couple of the more clueless statements are: """"Mexico will pay for the wall"""".... and """"Running the country is not much different than running a golf course"""".

Despite the attempt to hide the legislation, veterans groups have noticed and are letting their outrage be known. “This new tax on troops is absurd,” Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Brian Duffy said. “Ensuring veterans are able to successfully transition back to civilian life after military service is a cost of war and not a fee that Congress can just pass along to our troops. “Congress must stop nickeling and diming America’s service members and veterans.”

0,"Similarly,  a pollster deliberately choosing 12 Clinton Democrats—or 12 Trump Republicans—to poll tells us nothing about the constitution of preference in the population. However, given the ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the population, we might be able to deduce whether the pollster deliberately picked his or her sample rather than drawing them randomly. In the case of the Bible, this deduction cannot be made with statistical significance, because the Bible's heavy preference for mentioning males makes the choice of 12 males just as likely to be without any deliberate intent as intentional.  An interesting side note is that the Bible's very heavy bias mentioning of Jewish people makes the argument that Jesus intentionally selected Jews for apostles also without statistical significance.
"
0,"I only listed 'some' of her shortcomings due to space limitations.  As far as Ms. Parker is concerned, her previous columns, Meet the Press appearances etc. show that she is mostly a spokesperson for the center-right conservatives.

If it turns out to be Trump vs Clinton, I expect her to back Hillary because she has been bought and paid for by those same interests.

0,"While certainly wild, the reason I don't give these allegations any credibility is that not one shred of proof has been provided to indicate any part of them are true.  This document has been circulating for six months and the intelligence agencies (for all there good and bad) and news organizations (primarily for their bad) have not been able to substantiate anything in this dossier.  (Which by the way is really fun reading.)  If there was the least bit of anything being truthful it would have been reported.  For example the supposed meetings in Europe by the Trump attorney.  The FBI looked and can't find him ever having gone there and even the attorney said he had never been there.  So, allegations they remain until something actually is proven.

What is your reaction to the 7 years of the whitewater investigation (actually reopening it after the first independent investigator cleared the Clintons) so it could influence the 2,000 election? Do you think these investigations was non-partisan and fair?  Of course there is no proof at this early stage of an investigation. One does not wait for proof to investigate. Yet you seem to want to shut down the investigation. With the evidence of undisclosed contact with Russian officials from those in Trump's camp and Trump's behavior over the issue, I don't think it's inappropriate to say an investigation is merited; to think collusion have existed.

They are suicidal, but do not have the courage to kill themselves without perceiving the horror they have inflicted by killing other people. It is no coincidence that the majority of them kill themselves afterward, just as this man did.  Personal suicide is the motive. It's an unusual and bizarre clinical syndrome, but the precise psychological mechanisms have not been identified because these people have not been studied, since most of them are dead afterwards.  To that extent, President Trump is right and the APA is wrong. What gives me the authority to reach this conclusion?

No wonder Trump is gleefully celebrating the election of the old establishment Perez. I saw the debate and he was so much stronger and more confident than Perez. Perez was afraid to answer questions that would show he's still part of the old Clinton guard. Perez is another sign that the Democrats are still unwilling to admit the election loss was their fault.

The """"perils"""" she did speak of were fat-shaming, saying unflattering things about women, and somehow encouraging Putin.  The first two are true, but hardly putting us in peril.

0,"Spadaro is very adept at articulating the positive vision of mercy from Pope Francis; unfortunately he is less so when summarizing the views of those he sees in distinction from this vision. It was the same weakness in the Civilta article from the summer. I find he conflates & compresses diverse views & presents them in a flat, un-nuanced manner that I suspect many of those who hold the views being criticized would object to. For instance, in his talk he opposes Francis with the """"neo-crusaders"""" who posit an """"axis of evil."""" I'm sure Michael Gerson, the architect of the image, & himself both an admitted fan of Francis & ardent critic of Trump, would be surprised to hear himself accused of believing that someone is beyond mercy or redemption. Spadaro also mentioned that Francis is careful to avoid being identified with liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Spadaro's facile engagement with some of his interlocutors.

Remains to be seen if Trump can salvage anything out of this disaster.  Highly doubtful given the huge gap between the left and right in western society.

0,"Thought experiment: imagine for a moment if Hillary had won and had Chelsea sit in for her the way Ivanka did for her daddy? In what universe would there not have been howls of disapproval if not outright censure emanating from the halls of Congress? The answer is: none. I don't know about you, but I'm fed up with the double standard. Unless Democrats can learn how to howl and scream bloody murder about every last real infraction of Trump's the way Republicans did with Obama's fake ones (remember Sean Hannity's Dijon mustard-gate?) they'll keep losing elections.
"
1,"Trump's """"Make America Great Again"""" slogan I believe is correct in that acknowledges America has lost much of the """"Greatness"""" that was once rightly attributed to America.  No reasonable and knowledgeable person can take Hillary or the Democrat party at her/their word.  """"Today I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault,"""" Clinton said. """"Don't let anyone silence your voice. You have the right to be heard. You have the right to be believed."""" [Hillary Clinton, September 14, 2015]  In light of the facts of Bill's record of infidelity, the indisputable history of Hillary's personal character assignations and harassment of some 30 plus women victimized by Bill, not to mention Bills [sic] actions with under age females with his friend Epstein.  Trumps locker room language merits no defense. But for the left to demonize Trump and give Bill and Hillary support and a pass amounts to juvenile impetuous hypocrisy by the wanton post-American/anti-American democrat party.

These resolutions nullified unnecessary regulations and block agencies from reissuing them. ◦ Since CRA resolutions were introduced under President Clinton, they’ve been used only once, under President George W. Bush.  • The Wall Street Journal editorial: “So far the Trump Administration is a welcome improvement, rolling back more regulations than any President in history.” A SLEW OF LEGISLATION SIGNED: Despite historic Democrat obstructionism, President Trump has worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any President since Truman. • President Trump has worked with Congress to enact 28 laws during the first 100 days of his Administration.

Until there is a realization that """"we"""" are all responsible for the status quo, there can be no resolution. Growing opposition is pointless unless it leads to resolution.

Trump will just pressure the western US states to ship coal or else. BC will have no jobs and American coal will never come back to ship from our ports.  Clark tries to tell us this will help build her LNG pipe dream and once again tells the fib about LNG being green. Leakage from methane is eighty times worse than co2 as a greenhouse gas. Drilling, flaring, pumping through pipelines, compressing to liquid, shipping, decompressing for use and then burning LNG has no significantly cleaner footprint than mining, shipping and burning coal in high tech power plants. Current price of gas is too low to pay for drilling.  High risk political grandstanding, no thought of consequences - this is the BC Liberal legacy.

There aren't enough of white supremacist folks or alt right folks  to make a difference in any election so let's put that to rest. It is clear that Presidents are reluctant to cast blame on one group even when they certainly should ( cf Obama's reaction to the shooting of the 5 Dallas Officers during a protest).  I believe he seemed back track after calling out and denouncing the abominable racist groups that were protesting is that he and his family, in the meantime,  had been attacked by groups associated with the counter protest while trying to return to their home in NY.  I think is was a very personal and impulsive response -terribly ill- timed.  This is not a defense or an excuse. It is only a possible explanation Having said that, the fact that armed groups that encourage hate can gather is a serious problem. An investigation is warranted. Groups for violent regime change exist on both sides must be stopped.

He only knows how to send tweets into the atmosphere about how all these folks better watch out because there's a new sheriff in town. But there's nothing more. Trump has taken confusion to another level.

You also proved my point about Trump supporters not paying close attention to anything other than their own gibberish. Read my previous post again, so maybe you'll have more to offer than Palin-like word-salad nonsense.  You presume to know everything about what I do with my wealth, but actually know nothing. I've done more in research into advanced alternative fuel technologies in my work in Silicon Valley than you could ever begin to comprehend.

0,"|""""Can Europe's Centre Hold?"""" In other words, can the liberal democracy order that's more or less held since WW II hold? It's doubtful, largely because the term """"liberal democracy"""" has for 70 years been moving quite far to the right wing. As well because liberalism was discredited by Ronald Reagan and right wing evangelists in the 80's, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in 2016. The majority in the West don't trust the same old, very loosely-defined illiberal """"liberal"""" establishment. It's under attack from the right and from the left. And justly so. If all 2017 liberalism has to offer struggling suffering workers is increasing refugees and immigration, that will not suffice. Millions have an impression of existing in a Fourth World isolation where immigrants, refugees, and folks with unpopular religions and customs have assumed a greater importance than the well-being of citizens whose ancestors have lived in Western countries for hundreds of years. The 1% are not liberal.

Even though previous presidents have been caught in minor lies, or accused of lying  when their opponents choose to misunderstand their words, nobody has EVER been responsible for falsehoods on the scale of Donald Trump's.  But go ahead. If you think a president lying about consensual sex between two adults is equivalent to a false accusation of illegal wiretapping, or that the true statement """"you can keep your current plan"""" is a lie, just keep on believing.

That is not contemplated in American jurisprudence, nor is the notion that ALL of the adherents of a given religion constitute a danger. The “perception” of danger is entirely irrelevant; dangerousness is determined on a case-by-case basis by competent authorities using objective criteria. Religion and geography, standing alone, are not among them. The executive order is a Muslim ban. Giuliani has done Trump the disservice of bragging about his role in devising an approach which, it was hoped, would not look like a Muslim ban. No one was fooled: not those who support the ban and not those who oppose it.

Not hard to understand her motivations when these two groups deliver a large portion of the BC Liberal Party donations, and in a year so close to an election.  Then she chose a Trump tactic of blaming foreign investors for her misdeeds, when they already understood that the market had lost it's value premium.  And on top of that, she desperately tried to regain her footing by offering interest free loans for fist time buyers rather than work on the affordability issue.  There is a lot of blame for allowing this issue to fester, but it all points back to the political motivations of Ms Clark, rather than her desire to do the right thing.

You want to talk about a “boy” - - a “boy” the identity of whose mixed race parentage is in doubt, who never held a real job in his life, who published two “memoirs” (one of which was ghost written by the Pentagon bomber Wm. Ayers), who never convened the Senate subcommittee he nominally headed, who considers the Constitution an inconvenient nuisance, who never even set foot on mainland America until age 18 by which time his carefully cultivated hatred of America was set in stone, then you only have to look as far as your 44th President.

0,"Trump's plan would more than double the standard deduction to $15,000. But that change would be outweighed by his elimination of personal exemptions and head-of-household status. So the family's taxable income would be $60,000, and their tax bill would be $2,440 more than it is now. Trump's advisers deny that he will raise taxes on middle-income Americans. Stephen Miller, his top policy adviser, said Trump would provide tax-free child care savings accounts and other provisions to enable some families to reduce taxes. But Batchelder's analysis found that those provisions wouldn't be enough to offset the plan's other elements that would increase taxes for some middle income households. All independent analyses show most of the benefit of Trump's plan flowing to the wealthiest Americans. Nearly half of Trump's tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners, the Tax Policy Center found. Less than a quarter of the cuts would benefit the bottom 80 percent.

He was roughed-up, charged with a felony, and dumped on the Canadian side without his car or his jacket, in winter, in the middle of the night. All because he didn't obey their instructions fast enough. He was subsequently fined about US$1600, and lectured by a judge on the importance of obeying US law-enforcement. It was all completely trumped up. In fact, the local US Attorney's office refused to press charges, and Customs had to go to the local police instead.  So you don't need to be entering the US, be brown, or be an immigrant, to land in a heap of trouble with US Customs. You just need to be unlucky.

I can guarantee every global intelligence agency profile makes this same point about Trump.  He can be manipulated very easily precisely because he is a true narcissist.  This assures that no argumentation about his policies can ever be effective with him.  He's not really interested in policy.  He's interested in himself.   The only effective argumentation has to be centered around him.  Even his intelligence staff are now putting his name in every other paragraph because it keeps his interest in reading their briefs.  This is not about politics for me, or wallowing in hatred and loathing.  It's about the fact Donald Trump is unfit and unqualified to hold the presidency and represents the biggest security threat the US now faces.

Every appointee is a terrible person and every adjustment and growing pain evidence of gross incompetence. A scandal that rivals Watergate (spying on the president-elect, """"unmasking"""" Americans' names, and disseminating the secret reports throughout 15 or 17 agencies and eventually leaking the information to the press) doesn't even make the main webpage of the NY Times or Washington Post. In the fog of this existential crisis, nothing is going to make sense anymore. The fact that Trump has assembled an excellent team of national security / national defense that is extremely well-qualified to make these judgments is not considered.

I wish that 100% of Mormons had abandoned Trump.

0,"Wiggy, I think you're misconstruing the sometimes hysterical overreactions with anti-Americanism.  Mainly it's a combination of fear, frustration, and a horrible combination of bullying, loose cannon unpredictability, and  -- let's face it -- dangerous incompetence.  Remember, your country is for us the elephant next door who could crush us by simple inadvertence; and with Trump on the loose, convinced that he's God, the whole word is in a tizzy. As to the fascism thing, one can construct a solid case for it, but I doubt if Trump has the competence or the discipline to be a fascist.

1,"Thanks Jeff for the reply. But progressives (other than you evidently) do support bigger government and expansion in every direction. Socialized medicine, schools, housing, phones, you name it, they want to supply it.  Big Businesses and the wealthy are not paying as a direct result of progressives. Small business and working people are picking up the tab for them and everyone else. Progressives like Bush, Obama, Clinton and Trump are at the heart of the problem. They lie and call themselves conservative then pass the largest handouts/bailouts/social programs they can.  I don't blame the poor for being poor. I disagree with what to do about them. IMO it is idiotic to give a drunk a warm place to drink and expect him to change his lifestyle because of it.

0,"Unlike Canada, with its declining currency, the U.S. has a host of multinationals which operate all over the world; they are thus insulated against their domestic economy; diversified  by being in diverse markets. The  bull market in U.S. stocks contains internal inconsistencies, such as can be found by comparing P/E ratios for companies such as Apple and Microsoft, where one trades at just over half the value as the other. Tim Cook has made clear that a 35% federal and a 5% state corp income tax on funds returned from outside the U.S. (for Apple it's over 62% of sales) is a non starter; yet this is the status quo for all multinationals, which hold over a trillion USD that could in part be repatriated at a more reasonable rate, as Mr Trump has indicated. Plus the corp tax is too high. Bring that money back and the U.S. economy could boom, and this is on the horizon whilst the prophets of doom foresee the end of the bull.

Of course Hillary never said such a thing.  Second, there's no such thing as an abortion in the 9th month. As many people noted here at the time, if a baby is removed from the womb in the 9th month the procedure is a C-section. Or, in some late-term pregnancies that experience complications, labor will be induced.  Hillary then made some very moving comments about the agony women go through who are confronted with serious problems late in pregnancy. For God's sake, try some empathy.  Since over 90% of abortions occur in the first trimester I consider them with no more alarm than spontaneous abortions (""""miscarriages""""). Actually miscarriages are much sadder, because very often these are pregnancies women greatly desire to bring to term.

He has neither grounds nor any reason to WANT to keep things secret (even temporarily until the investigation concludes).  And the testimony so far... has included him confirming that Trump asked him to drop the Flynn investigation -and that he was subsequently investigating Trump himself for obstruction.

Not at the whim of Trump, like he does with anything and everything,  he just wants to make it look like he's responsible for everything under the sun.

Apart from the 'national' part of the socialism, I saw little to distinguish between Communism and Nazism (which is what people here usually think of if mentioning fascism)  when those two political ideologies raged in Europe.  Being authoritarian, boorish and contemptuous of opposing views are not good character traits. But while Trump has all those character traits and is the U.S. president, this does not him a fascist make. And he's unlikely to turn his nation into a fascist state either.

0,"Currently, opinion articles in the R-G online edition have the following authors:  DANA MILBANK (liberal) THOMAS FRIEDMAN (liberal) DAVID BROOKS (conservative, kinda sort-of) CATHERINE RAMPELL (liberal) GARRISON KEILLOR (liberal) E.J. DIONNE (liberal) GEORGE WILL (conservative) TIMOTHY EGAN (liberal) NICHOLAS KRISTOF (liberal)  This is typical, and the count is 7 liberal and 2 conservative opinion columnists. Clearly, a balance would be 5 and 4, but we never see that and the liberals are often of the flaming sort (Rampell and Dionne for instance) while the conservatives (like David Brooks) tend to be of the moderate sort and lately have even been of the anti-Trump variety (like George Will and Jonah Goldberg). The R-G idea of balance is token representation of conservative thought mixed with 3 to 4 times as many liberal viewpoints. As the Opinion pages go, so goes the reporting and editing. I would switch to a more conservative local news source immediately if one existed.

Trump has done more to create jobs in one week than Obama did in 8 years and Trudeau has done in 2 years.  Right now, Trump is clearly the best leader on the planet.  With Putin a close second.

As it is, to find the illusions stripped from the self-righteous Christians that rule in the Church and in the world is wisdom worth many times its proverbial weight in gold.

One thing on their mind since election day - impeach Trump, business of the country be da**ed. I'd have at least SOME smidgen of respect for them if they let the special council, something they whined about appointing incessantly, do their job and wait for the results. My tax dollars at rest.

The GOP in the 21th century is little more than a white identity death cult. Don't take my word for it. Ask David Duke, a grand wizard of the KKK. He was thrilled when Trump won.

The EPA """"standards"""" that Obama and his minions tried to enforce were egregious; not just for farmers and ranchers, but for individuals, even renters, and would have raised prices of owning property or even renting it ridiculously.

Even Maunalua ahupua'a, fishpond and mauka ahupua'a and Maunawili ahupua'a with its twin wetlands can be restored with minimal impact. There are even ahupua'a in Honolulu that can be restored with a net beneficial effect on makai downstream water, which is presently a polluted ocean outfall, that can be cleaned of pollutants by restoring the natural wetlands that act as a filter, returning clean water to the ocean.  There are many ahupua'a on the other, less populated, islands which can easily be restored as ahupua'a with minimal impact. Food sovereignty trumps community redesign.

Liberal democracy has left behind a large swatch of the population - mostly in suburban and rural areas.  In the end, the vote of a high-school educated out-of-work manufacturing employee is worth exactly the same as a university educated professor.  Donald Trump's win merely reflects that there were more of the former and less of the latter.  The media needs to step out of their echo chamber and get their heads around what happened south of the border.  In Canada, a perfect storm is brewing:  Just Trudeau's focus on identity politics, Global Warming and wasteful spending  is precisely the same path that Obama focused on.

Obama leads to Hillary, so Republicans can now spend the next four years doing what Republicans love best: Four more years of congressional Republicans investigating Hillary Clinton so they can condemn her and pillory her some more. And their base just eats it up. Never mind putting together a plan to beef up the election process. Never mind trying to prevent Russia from doing it again. Nope. Hillary must be investigated!

I read 30 years ago what Orwell wrote about it. It's clear most revising and whitewashing of history (and ignoring the more egregious parts) is done by the right wing (e.g, imperialists, monarchists, conservatives), The right wing has always written history, including Canadian history, because the right wing has been the victors of history (e.g.,chroniclers of the British Empire and American hegemony). The politically correct cannot change history and have no reason to revise it. But women, Jews, ethnic minorities, gays, First Nations, certainly have a right to point out examples of Canada's history that have been less than glorious. Obviously, in light of where we want to be now (growing democracy, world peace, social equality, economic progress for all), history falls way short.

0,"This is the kind of logic that drives me nuts.  Trump has used executive orders for the exact same reason Obama used them.  Neither president can get any legislation passed through this mess of a congress totally controlled by a GOP that can't get it's own act together and never will.  Trump himself has signed a number of Executive orders which have not been totally legal or moved beyond the scope of the presidency which is why so many of them wind up in court.  Trump can continue his weaponization of Executive Orders to force Congress to act, but he won't be any more successful than Obama because Congressional Republicans don't want to govern.  They want to be re elected.

0,"Quite scary how many people down voted you and clearly don't believe in free speech. The underlying sentiment of course is that _other_ people will not be as smart as the down-voters and will be duped if they are allowed to listen to just anyone... so best to let the down-voters decide what people are allowed to hear. And that's not authoritarian, oh no. Exactly one of the attitudes that got Trump elected.

1,"I think Trump just reflects the general disdain for women that is held by most members of the GOP and many Democrats too. How else to explain that in 2017 the USA has not one single day of paid federally mandated maternity leave. The GOP is anti abortion but by golly when you birth that little sucker it's back to work tomorrow lady!

0,"The main problem with Comey's letter is that it fails to make clear enough that there had NOT been a smoking gun, or any evidence whatsoever discovered yet.  The FBI was embarking on nothing more than a protracted fishing expedition, yet GOP leaders, include Trump are characterizing the reopening of the e-mail probe as a """"bombshell"""", a """"smoking gun"""", and even """"the biggest case of corruption since Watergate"""", when in fact NOTHING has yet been found except the mere presence of more emails that the FBI wants to fish through.  If the FBI wanted to notify congress that it is embarking on this probe, it is obligated to make clear the fact that it is merely fishing.

Trump is a mistake, so is Bannon, and this ill-conceived pro-Russian position of theirs is hype and spin that will fail after the two Big Men preen a while. Canada can go its own way if it wants to. Sovereign nation. We didn't die as a result of any trade punishment for our position in 2003 and we won't now.  There is such a thing as principle. Putin is a dictator.

0,"The second debate was the public asking questions from the audience. Not from the press. Did you enjoy Donald creeping up behind  Clinton all night? Did you hear him answer one single question on what he would do? He is unhinged and it's scary how that doesn't bother his followers. Is there a conspiracy out there that trumpateers wouldn't buy? Apparently, no.  After all that billion of dollars of free publicity, suddenly the same press is rigging this election? No.  It didn't stop Melania from going on CNN yesterday. What they're doing, finally, is letting the country hear what comes out of this con man's mouth. His own words (and actions!) are bringing him down.

0,"The fake news media feel free to put out slanted and sometimes outright fake news under the guise of freedom of the press.  But when Trump wants to run an ad they become so offended and outraged when they feel his standard of """"The Truth"""" doesn't jive with theirs.  The elite press claim to be the last bastion of a free society, but they really look down on the everyday people they claim to be protecting.  That's why they are still outraged that a dummy like Trump could survive and win after they bombarded him with hundreds of millions of dollars in negative attack ads and articles.  How dare he challenge the press...and win!  Nobody has done that before.  The time of coddling the press and bowing to their power is over.  Trump has turned the tables and if he does nothing else for the next 4 years, he will have done this country a great favor.  President Trump is going at Mach One with his hair on fire and the pitiful press and the Dems are left with calling him names and protesting.

0,"The only civil rights you posses as a matter of law are in the Constitution.  The Constitution is a law which was proposed by an assembly and adopted by elective processes.  As a matter of fact, not hopeful suppositions, civil rights ARE contingent upon the whims of a tyrannical majority and decided by a vote - in the case of constitutional amendments a supermajority.  You are correct the the Federal judiciary has decided it is empowered to """"interpret for each new generation"""", which of course itself is not constitutional.  Two major decisions which were being considered by the electorate pursuant to their constitutional rights to legislate were trumped by a majority of a nine person panel based on whimsical notions of what they considered to be good ideas - abortion and same sex marriage.  That tendency to legislate can be reined in not just by appointments but by amendment.  Interestingly the very thing which does protect civil rights without the Constitution are natural rights.

Rupert Murdoch saw an opening to make $$ by being the only mainstream news network with right and center-right commentary, but purely a smart monetary move, not because he's politically on the right. Just watch FOX TV network to see very non-conservative dumpster of entertainment. Journalism is dead. There's very little concern with honesty and reporting of FACTS that haven't been distilled and filtered through the political ideologies of the individual reporters and editors. I go back to my original statement that the media is now in the business of creating the narrative and manipulating the reporting of events to match that narrative. Same reason why the news keeps using the left's narrative that Trump's immigration order is a """"Muslim Ban"""" when it's clearly not. Only 1 of the top 8 highest Muslim pop countries in the world even made the list and that was Obama's friends in Iran. The order leaves out 2/3 of the Muslim world but is a """"Muslim Ban""""?

0,"MSW is omitting a salient fact. Professor Barrett had a paper she co-authored in 1998 with John Garvey, who is now president of Catholic University of America. Senator Feinstein suggested that the position Barrett took in her 1998 paper is tantamount to proposing that, for someone sitting on a court bench, religious faith should trump law when the two appear to be in conflict.  This attitude should certainly be questioned, since I would say that a judge's first allegiance should be to the law. His or her religious beliefs should certainly inform the judge's thinking, but the law should take precedence.  I would ask the conservatives who are likely to huff and puff about my belief a question. Suppose a Muslim became a judge. How would you feel if this judge applied Sharia to his or her rulings? What is the difference?

Specifically, it requires them to go from saying, “These accusations are false; it never happened” to saying, “Sure, it happened, but there’s nothing wrong with it.”  That is where Republicans now find themselves, and there’s a deep irony at work. Donald Trump rode into office on the widespread belief that politics is corrupt and only an outsider like him could clean it up. Now, it looks like his all-purpose excuse for his own misdeeds and those of his family and advisers will be, “Hey, don’t blame me — we all know politics is corrupt!”

Obviously, this is not hyperbole; just look at who supports and follows him, Christians are right there, lock step, and weeping with joy that their voice and deepest desires are manifest in Trump. C'mon Rapture! If the world ever needed Christians to go to heaven, this is the time! Trump at the right hand of G-d, a vision for eternity! Sing praise and Hallelujah!

0,"These stories have nothing to do with Trump, but everything to do with the Russians and with Trump's crooked staff people like his former Chairman Manafort, his attorney Cohen, and his former national security advisor Flynn-- and in some cases Donald Jr. and his son-in-law Kushner (and in the case of just two projects Ivanka with her Youtube Video on the project and her pictures for the SOHO project). There is no hoax about what the facts show about what the Russians did and what Manafort and Flynn did. Even more information is coming out about the Russians since Facebook has agreed to provide records of the fake news ads that the Russians were buying and there are still more turning up everyday. Hey Trump it is not you, just stay cool instead of trying to interfere and speak out in ways that make you look like you are trying to stop the investigation. Like always you are making things worst for yourself-- any smart person would just keep their mouths shut.

I don't support any of the protestors that resort to physical intimidation and I'm anti-Trump and stated so for some time now.  I'm one of millions who feel the same way.  To the flip side, and maybe this was your intent.   It's stupid to say Trumps school yard taunts deserve the kind of response he's getting from Democratic political operatives. (Lliccardo is all politics, he's not an average American citizen).   The hissy throwing protestors do not represent very many people.  They'd be better off letting him talk - maybe ask if he could complete a sentence once and awhile.  Trumps total lack of any experience or. skill set, just becomes more obvious the more he talks.

It's a given that Kim of North Korea is impossible to reckon with.   But it is the idiot in the White House who uttered - on television no less - the confounding threat to launch an attack """"of fire and fury"""" against North Korea the likes of which the world has never seen.  Talk about ratcheting up the tension.  Mark Grant is either so enamoured of Trump that he can't see past his nose or he, like Trump, has no clue about the importance of quiet diplomacy at a time like this.  Behind the scenes world diplomats are working all out to defuse this crisis - no thanks to Trump's impulsive outburst that reportedly not one single Trump advisor had a hint was coming.

0,"Trump Economics 101  One thing that we can all agree to; is that globalization has brought westerners a greater number of products at cheaper prices.  Moving production back to the US will increase prices, so if Americans want to maintain the same standard of living, they will have to pay more for the same; but in theory, increased prices will be offset by lower taxes.  So the US is the most indebted country in the world, and if taxes are cut in half, and military spending doubles, what will that do to the US debt?

0,"I think Trump supporters make a mistake by reading coherence and competence into an improbable result, which Trump's win clearly was. Certainly a large chunk of the American electorate reached for a large and smelly lump with which to beat the establishment. That doesn't necessarily make their cause righteous, the result inevitable or their instrument of choice a paragon. Indeed, Clinton won the popular vote by a substantial margin and would have won the presidency but for the vagaries of the electoral college, which currently privileges the votes of rural red states over the votes from urban blue states.

I am certain you are, but you are again on the hunt to create upset and be noticed.  You could be far more effective if you left the snippy  commentary characteristic of your posts out of providing useful links and information.  No one on here thinks all of those with college educations voted for Clinton, and if you want to discuss the issue of voting bases, then I await your discussion of how white college-educated women let themselves vote for someone like Trump.  Actually, don't bother....it has been roundly discussed by white female political specialists (all of whom are college-educated) already, and with proven insight.  BTW - thanks for the links re: electoral college.  The more education about our political system the better off we all are!  Did you get your new stove?
"
0,"Donald J Trump is responsible for opening the flood gates and making hate, racism and sexism fashionable and acceptable within a certain segment of American society. This is his legacy. Regretfully, that self confidence among the Far Right under its many banners (KKK, Tea Party Activists, Supremacists, Christian Conservatives to name a few) has spread like a cancer to other countries; Canada included. After all, if it is acceptable coming from the Instigator in Chief then it must be good.
"
0,"Using the first link, just look at the structure of the entire article. Clearly the author is well versed in persuasive writing. For example, the 3rd and 5th paragraphs use the local incident to support a broad generalization of all Trump supporters as if it is fact, straight from Clinton's campaign. Then the 6th paragraph sets the stage for the 15th paragraph, which attempts to blur or dissolve the line between contemporary reality and what existed 50 years ago. Specifically, after reminding the audience of the 60s era strife early on in the article, it is then easy to dismiss the residents claims made in the 16th paragraph.  The closing paragraph shows the real agenda, that race relations are so bad that it is beyond repair. The problem I see is that the media themselves are the ones stoking the fire, by #1 taking many of Trump's words out of  context to drive up ratings, and #2 ignoring the real racism that HRC was part of domestically and overseas.
"
0,"I find it disconcerting that Trump would come out very publicly to disagree with a CIA report about Russian interference when, maybe, he hasn't read the report, and then goes on to trash an agency that is tasked with spying on the rest of the world and giving the information to the President. Then says he'll only listen to them when he feels they have something 'important' to say.  D'yah think the CIA is going to note this and in future just submit reports that just contain the information that Donald Trump wants to see?  Are you old enough to remember George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq and the quite deliberate tweaking of intelligence to support that move?  But I guess we'll see, won't we.

0,"Trump's actions are just one example of why I find it so irritating when people insist that immigration law ought to be enforced as strictly as possible.  So many laws are unenforced or only partially enforced.  We can start from the very obvious -- speed limits to the more esoteric -- companies that do business with foreign governments, where bribery and other corruption is involved.  We have everything in between -- the unenforcement of the tax code, or the Organic Foods Production Act, etc, etc. Given the resources that exist, there is no way to enforce every law on the books. BTW -- Sally Yates was fired for disagreeing with him, as was Comey.  I wish that there were a way to know what really happened re Rosenstein.
"
0,"From a Game Theory standpoint, Trump is saying the right things. By putting the One China policy on the table he puts pressure on the Chinese to play ball on trade and currency matters. Maybe he's serious about Taiwan and maybe he isn't, but he now he has a lever where before he had none. I doubt if Middle America is hating him for it.  Likewise with Russia. Obama's policy on Russia was old school, Cold War politics. Trump on the other hand is being pragmatic. (Seriously, do Americans care that Crimea left Ukraine and became part of Russia?) At the same time, Trump is inviting Russia back from its shift to closer ties with China, while offering the possibility of cooperation on their mutual problem with Islamic State. Again, other than those with a Cold War mentality, what's for the American people to dislike?

LaPointe says: """"...white people railing against feminism and “political correctness,” just as in the case of Bissonnette, one hears not the authentic cry of the have-nots, but rather the ugly resentment of those who already have, but want still more.""""  LaPointe feels the first-world version of Mishra's """"anger"""" is unearned, and that's unfair. Directionless disenfranchisement resulting in Mishra's """"active anarchism"""" is an equal opportunity affliction. If the """"privileged"""" white middle class can feel the same anarchic nihilism as any third world proto-tribal nationalist movement (from Trump-to-ISIS) Mishra's core message is all the more pertinent.  Isn't it more constructive to listen to the disenfranchised than to wag a judgmental finger with today's vogue academic charges of """"racism/sexism"""", before the sadness turns into Mishra's (& Bissonnette's) nihilistic rage?  More peace, love and understanding. Less judgement, please.

The opposition is about what has been written about EXTENSIVELY on these threads and in all forms of the secular media.  It is politics of division, insult, and bullying.  It is about the horribly reactive, and arrogant positions of the Trump advisors and those both on the transition team and those being appointed to various positions or who will be nominated; about the campaign promises Trump made and his advisors echoed; and on and on and on.  The threat to our democracy comes mainly from (a) those who flagrantly choose to ignore constitutional laws such as divisions (and limits) of power, and (b) one-party rule of all branches of the Federal government (executive, legislative, and judicial) which is close to being 100% complete.  So you may well agree with someone like Woodmax, but it doesn't mean that you are any clearer in your views than he is.  No way.

0,"I find strange that the globe and mail basically wrote its article on trumps claims verbatim to a news release by the ny times, which it often does. That ny times article was written by a few writers Michael Schmidt being one of them. He offers no evidence whether trump was or was not witetapped however in Jan of this year he wrote another article which shows wiretapping used to find a link between trump aides and Russia. Is that not simply trashing both articles. It's apparent trumps aides were all wiretapped by the FBI and CIA. Why wouldn't they wiretap trump as well. It's either terrible reporting or terrible investigating but my assumption is both.

1,"It seems clear to me since Donald Trump's election that a defining element of being a leftist or rightist (as opposed to liberal or conservative) is the absence of any capacity to reason soundly. But at least we can post our rants and rambles to the Interwebs and feel it matters, because we have legions of cretins just as deranged as we are.

0,"I don't particularly see how this failed test can be measured on a scale of optimal outcomes. A failed test means North Korea has test feedback, and will improve the missile so the next one is successful. A successful test means that North Korea is already at that point. The difference in time between the two states of having a proven missile and having one that is close to proven but needs some bug fixing is likely much shorter than any possible military action towards North Korea - which likely would be disastrous, regardless of whether North Korea had this missile working or not. There needs to be a solution, but I don't see how that could ever be a military one, here. And the impact of this missile test's result is plausibly negligible - I don't think that Trump has to consider any different a scenario because this missile failed.

To sum: states which spend more than the national average per medicaid recipient are penalized under the Senate bill by having medicaid funding cut. This oh so coincidentally affects mostly blue northeastern states which voted against Trump. This provision is meant to directly punish people in these states through the loss of access to medical care. But wait, you say, doesn't Alaska have the highest medical costs in the nation, including for medicaid patients? Why yes, but look here, there's an exemption for """"sparsely populated"""" states, mostly red, including Alaska. This exemption was included specifically to try and win over Murkowski. Maybe this addresses her concern about """"preserving medicaid"""" but it does nothing to improve the other things she discussed such as lowering premiums and stabilizing the Alaskan market.

So far he has not hesitated in throwing under the bus anyone around him who sees things differently and dares to say so.

You might want to check out a backstory from the meeting in Malta last Feb from the Financial Times. Italy is in the EU. Google Trump investments Italy   Important to remember that Italy is not Rome, and so Italy may fit a Brexit agenda that is more important to the Trumpet than tea with the Pope. Its the photo op! OReilly was in a generic  crowd shot so the Trumpet wants a sit down photo! maybe even a selfie with family flanking the Pope. It isn't the conversation it is how Trump leverages everything into something for his own advantage -- or the Trump Empire. Or brand ok for Ivanka's clothing line.  And... there is the super tariff Trump wants to place on Italian products.

Sexual abuse is a manifestation of the abuse of power and is perfectly consistent with Mr. Trump's personal and business history.  There is absolutely no reason to disbelieve his own boasting of such behavior and no reason to doubt the several women who have stepped forward to validate his claims.

Trump and his Republican hacks, in their desperation to remove Obama from history, will slit the throats of the poor stiffs who voted them in -- and those same stiffs, not being too bright, will keep cheering them on (at least till they need their health coverage and find it gone).

0,"Trump is absurd. He receives talking points with full confidence from certified loons Alex Jones and #1 cheerleader Sean Hannity, while disregarding the fact-based findings of the FBI, CIA and others.  Assange is no better: a tinpot manipulator with a get-out-of-jail-free agenda of his own. Why did he never release any revelations from the RNC? Who were his sources? He'll never tell.  Meanwhile, Russia holds all the cards – their stooge now firmly implanted in the whiter than white-house. And they are already exonerated by Trump for unprecedented electoral interference.  It's only about who wins. Not whose throats were slit, to put him there.

0,"About Donald Trump, Meryl Streep said  “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence invites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose.”  That would be fine, but earlier in her speech, she said (earning laughs):  """"So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick them all out you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.""""  Apparently Meryl Streep, a powerful public figure on a public platform, can mock and malign a group of people with no apparent sense of irony.  I certainly won't defend Donald Trump and his mocking of others, but then why would I support or defend Ms. Streep's own hypocrisy in mocking others.

He will use judicial activism and all those who support it as a political pinata to rally his support as the economy and immigration were the very issues that got him to the White House. So, celebrate, but don't cry come mid -terms.

For thirty years we have seen the rise of a right wing media dead set on misinforming and disinforming the American audience to the point that viewers/listeners cannot separate the truth from the lies anymore. We have trump because of the dishonesty of the entire spectrum of right wing media. Shame on us as a nation for giving up the search for truth for the sake of garbage reporting that reinforces prejudices, hatreds and fears. We are better people.

Not for the first time are you allowing blind partisanship and unbridled hatred for Trump to affect your judgement.  In the absence of any concrete, relevant and cogent evidence to support your assertion about Craft's appointment compared with others, let us simply agree to disagree.

In fact if it's publicized too much it could backfire 'big league '.  As they say : """"All politics is local"""". The real power in the United States is not with the President but with Congress. A lot of Republicans in Congress despise Trump and his associates. Trudeau has managed to anger a lot of powerful Republicans in Congress with Trudeau's ridiculous statements. For example Trudeau's effusive and bizarre statement admiring the brutal military dictatorship of Cuba and Castro """"el comodante"""" angered powerful US Republican Senators Rubio and Cruz. Do you honestly think US Congress will give special exemptions to Canada? No! To be fair US will impose any import taxes on all countries.

Trump has made exactly zero policy changes in Iraq, yet his supporters credit him with defeating ISIS.  Trump has made exactly zero policy changes on the domestic economy, yet his supporters say he reduced unemployment and boosted the economy. At this point, it wouldn't surprise me if Trump gets credit for the upcoming eclipse.  Unquestionably, there has been a lot of noise and activity surrounding President Trump, but in terms of government policy, there have been very few changes from the previous administration.  The only notable thing Trump has done is begin the process to effectively gut the staff at several government agencies, and we aren't likely to see the impact of that for several years.  Trump hasn't, in my opinion, done anything particularly bad.  In fact, he hasn't done anything at all.  He's a failure as a leader.

Everyone (excepts psychopaths) has a conscience and has the ability to discern truth from falsehood. The question may be posed whether Trump has a personality disorder. But when it came to telling the truth, where was Bernard Law? In the movie SPOTLIGHT he gave a copy of the Catechism to the editor of the Boston Globe after his interview with him.

0,"Oregon has over regulated the  legal cannabis market fearing a crackdown from Trump. The problem is that the idea that """"seed to sale tracking"""" will stop the black market is ridiculous. It will do the opposite. Tracking is very complicated and very expensive. We now have thousands of pages of ever changing rules  no one understands. Over regulation has driven family farms and mom and pop businesses out replacing them with businesses owned by wealthy investors. But these bigger businesses are not more compliant, they are just more sophisticated at breaking rules. The result is higher prices at legal stores so lots of people return to the underground market, which is now bigger than ever. The answer is to have a simple system where everyone can participate. This will result in the least black market and the most tax revenue. The only way to stop diversion to other states is to end federal prohibition. Trump could fix this by letting states impose lean effective regulation,  but he won't.

Trump point blank said he gives money to candidates like Hillary (who was a guest at his wedding) to get legislation passed in his favor. The heads of all these giant companies on Wall Street are friends with trump. You think for a second he's going to pass legislation that benefits the everyday american? Think again...he's going to keep the system exactly the way it is, and will find ways to benefit him and his friends. Republican and Democrat are two sides of the same card, the Wall Street card.

Circuit issued an order to stay  the administration’s appeal of the district court decision in U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, a case challenging Cost-Sharing Reduction (“CSR”) payments to health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) Section 1402. The district court decision found that the House of Representatives had standing to sue the executive branch, that reimbursements to health insurance issuers for CSR requires an appropriation by Congress, and that the Obama Administration’s reimbursements to issuers of CSR without an annual appropriation was illegal. The D.C.

0,"That's simply not true. Fusion GPS did oppo research for a Republican, but the Steele dossier was funded by Clinton, the DNC, and the FBI. The dossier was leveraged not just by the DNC, but allegedly by the FBI and NSA to conduct wiretaps on Trump which people in the Obama administration then used to leak to the press info on Trump (after possibly illegally unmasking names in the wiretaps).  Until yesterday, the Clinton adminstration, including the lawyer who contracted out the work for them, denied all knowledge of the origins of the dossier. The deception on the part of the DNC and Clinton campaign is pretty incredible, especially since their charges of a Trump-Russia connection was based primarily on this dossier!

0,"More nonsense. The purported reason for the 90-day country-based ban and the 120-day refugee ban was to allow the government time to come up with a list of countries that weren’t providing the US with enough information, and ban entries from those countries indefinitely. The 90 and 120 days are long gone since Trump signed his executive order. Meanwhile, Trump shot himself in the foot a few weeks ago by depicting Qatar as a terrorist-supporting country, then a few days later selling them $12 billion in weapons. How could the Supreme Court judges realistically impose a travel when today a country is being depicted as terrorist and tomorrow the message is the complete opposite? What a circus!

The whole """"Trump not under investigation"""" thing is just right wing media spin to confuse the low informed.  It has NEVER been about Trump himself being under investigation for something specific he did.  The investigation was always about looking into the Trump campaign and its apparent, and constant, ties to Russia.  The investigation at the time Comey testified was looking into the Trump campaign in general, and not Trump specifically.  However, and this might come as a shock to you, Trump himself was part of his own campaign - which encapsulated him within the Trump campaign investigation.

There is no conflict of interest from Mueller -- if there was, the Republican Rosenstein would not have appointed him, also a Republican.  Mueller discontinuing his membership in a Trump property over a minor dues issue isn't enough.

No context, timeframe or source were provided for this quoted word, but it clearly was not part of his previous comment about firing Comey.  Is it now considered ethical journalism at the Register-Guard to manufacture an inflammatory compounded headline posing as a quote, when in fact no such thing was actually spoken? Is the Register-Guard so desperate to generate clicks that they are willing to sacrifice journalistic integrity? I understand some liberty is taken in constructing headlines, but there is no need to make up sensational quotes that headline-only readers will repeat as if they are true.

0,"I do not see the Supreme Court’s ruling as a major set-back for Trump’s travel ban.  The relationships of people to be allowed to enter the US is still not perfectly clear, but that does not matter. What matters is those wanting to enter proving the relationships.  How will that be done? We simply cannot take their words that they are related to someone in the US, and records to prove relationships may not exist in the six countries mentioned in the ban.  I believe most people wanting to enter will not be able to positively establish the relationships and will not be allowed in.  By the time AG Chin realizes this is happening, the Supreme Court most likely will have rule in Trump’s favor.

A first step, a necessary first step, is that he must fire Steve Bannon and the cabal of neo-Nazis Bannon has brought to the White House. If Trump had been remotely serious about healthcare, he would have had legislation ready on Inauguration Day, and a congressperson lined up to introduce it, that would have at least resembled his campaign promises. Instead, he embraced legislation that was antithetical to his promises -- because he never had a clue about healthcare policy. He recently pronounced himself surprised by how complicated it is!

Were wage and price controls a Conservative idea? In Canada the 1974 election was fought on wage and price controls and the (Progressive) Conservatives supported the policy introduced by their American cousins. Trudeau opposed it.* He changed his mind. I suppose to some people it all make sense if you apply the right label. We may convince ourselves we know what a politician will do but that is a belief and not a certainty. To be uncertain about Trump is perhaps a better approach to politics than the certainty provided by partisanship (?).  *I think elections have always been fought on emotion and not fact. Fake news and alt-fact have always been true for the partisan. Nothing new here.

Look back to 1993 at the language he used when he went after Native American Indians who competed with him for casino markets. Same Same methodology. It keeps working for him. The Emperor hasn't worn clothes for a long time, and people continue to applaud his tailor. Consider how few eligible voters actually vote. Consider the efforts applied to 'controlling the vote' by limiting in whatever way possible the number of people who turn out to vote. If you know exactly how 2,000 people will vote, you don't want more to vote, period.

Sure, he's a narcissist:  His followers have been trained that that's a good thing, especially in a consumer society; and they're all good consumers:  These are people who would rather have someone tell them what to do than take any kind of responsibility for their lives, let alone their choices:  They wouldn't even vote unless they were sure their vote meant they wouldn't have to follow through on that civic duty anymore.  Donald Trump's fake personality speaks to their disengagement, validates their apathy in a way no one else can, and reassures them that the democracy they fear is the real enemy.

The Fake News loves Trudeau because Trudeau is destroying jobs, incomes and living standards and turning Canada into a high unemployment, low wage wasteland.

Both parties love it when they can spin the narrative and it should be the reporters job to not contribute to cult of personality type candidates that know how to use the press.  Trump is the result of today's journalism as all forms of press gave him so much free, unpaid time on air that he ended up spending less than half the money as Hillary on his campaign.

Gabby noted that most of those sent to Afghanistan are low-income white men and women who die without being noticed.  None of the general public has to sacrifice in any way and most do not even notice the lives and treasure wasted in the sands of Afghanistan.  Shameful!

0,"Regarding the banning of immigrants from the US, we have heard  Trump say numerous times that they need to find out what is going on. He should spend more time trying to figure out what is going on with American born citizens. While he is at it, denouncing the NRA would be a good start but that would cut into his base support.
"
0,"Obviously many commentators do not understand/are  dismissive of the inclusion of gender, climate change and aboriginal issues. However if not included then those issues will be ignored and used as a future lever against trade partners. While Trump whines about Mexico's so called trade advantage, if the previous NAFTA negotiators had put STRONG labor rules into the deal maybe we would not have had major US and Canadian companies going to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labor. Trump can complain all he likes but much of the Mexican trade imbalance is through his own US companies taking advantage of weak labor, environmental provisions. If they had been strong, included in the main part of the treaty, maybe things would be different now. Same with climate change; either we all take action or the one that does not has an advantage. Same with gender and aboriginal issues.

That system eventually could change dramatically as at least two companies are rushing to get robotic fruit-picking machines to market.

Neither was he supported by """"the majority"""" of voters, as has been asserted elsewhere in this comment thread.  There is no doubt he won the electoral college. (Once again, I will likely profit personally from this outcome.)  Pretending his victory is representative of the will of voting America is false - and it contributes to a bankrupt storyline that some are perpetuating where it's somehow the media/establishment vs. the majority of American voters. This is inaccurate.  And it would be similarly inaccurate if Clinton had won the electoral college, lost the popular vote by millions, and her supporters made the same assertion.

He is lassoing groups to keep protests at bay as he chips away at the constitution and thwarts the laws and precedents of this country.  He is setting up an autocratic situation slowly but surely and poising himself to mingle his business with government without anyone daring to stop him lest he pull the privilege rug he carefully laid out from under them.  I used to think he was dumb, now I think he is oily and patient, carefully laying the groundwork for himself to be tightly supported and he needs to be called out.  He doesn't care about any of us.

The Tea Party was largely maligned by the mainstream press but it set the foundation for the dismantling of the democratic party. This occupy townhall movement will be praised by the media as a resistance movement but may suffer a similar fate as the Occupy movement, which by embracing a more extreme position undermines its ability to be sustainable.

But this was still a case of a mature person in a position of power taking advantage of a weaker, less mature person. That may not be quite assault, but it isn't exactly noble behavior either.

That makes his conduct more pertinent and more newsworthy.  The problem with the """"Clinton did it too"""" argument is that it deflects scrutiny from Trump. It makes it sound as if you're arguing that Trump should get a pass because he's not the only one who's (allegedly) guilty.  There's a hierarchy of urgency here. Clinton may or may not be guilty, but Trump is the president and that makes him the subject of greater concern.

He simply reacts to whatever immediate stimulus that he encounters which distracts him from his normally constant state of dwelling upon his own self-imagined greatness.

Believe it or not, it takes little intelligence to recognize that the battery compartment of PC's makes an excellent bomb carrier.

On Sunday, in front of millions of viewers of 60 Minutes, the Trump children were asked if they would serve in their father's administration.  They all said no, they would concentrate on running the Trump business empire.

0,"I don't believe anyone in the House or Senate Intelligence committees buy into Trump's assertion that Comey was too hard on Hillary. These committees will continue their work. Unfortunately their slow pace may mean that Trump will nearly have finished his term before impeachment proceedings can begin (if evidence suggests he colluded with the Russians).  The firing of Comey has backfired for Trump. It just heaps more suspicion on him. The sad thing is that the wheels of justice turn slow.

0,"I like chatting with you. I think that the tax system needs to be simplified, as in no more (or certainly far less) 'write offs.' I have thought that for years. But to do that means it includes the very wealthy. I am okay with that. I figure they pay most of the taxes, and we need their tax money. I figure we do not need as much 'write-offs' as we now have.  Like you, I am nowhere close to the 1% ers. So won't impact me one way or the other either.  But last. I read a lot on Trump/behaviors in years past. I did with President Obama too but I always do with all! I want to know who they are as people, long before they are cast in the political arena. What I learned about President Trump is his inherent kindness to total strangers. That he took what he was given in his dad's fortune & rather than squander it, he grew it- """"Hugely"""" lol! That he is a good dad. And he has always followed God and not just to woo voters. *Speaking for me only* that's what I look for in personal attributes.

Hillary has the support of radically progressive people and Democrats are smart enough not to eat each other alive publicly. They just do it behind the scenes and occasionally get caught, poor Berinie!  Republicans are cannibalistic. Their loyalty is to their belief and sometimes principles which overrides their loyalty to party.  If Hillary gets elected the Democrats will give her their full support and even change rules to get her policies through Congress.  If Trump gets elected, even the Republicans can't stand him so Trump will actually pull the two parties together to stop him when he goes over the top.  Trump may be our only hope for saving this country and not because he is the best candidate. It may be because he is disliked by both sides!

Manners also dictate a tolerance of others - even including the Trump - and looking for the good rather than focusing on the bad.  It is the current time that is without manners as they do require respect for others as in their opinions and viewpoints.  Today one must be politically correct and conform to the sanctioned views.

Then you throw out a bare straw man argument about Bill Clinton and infidelity. Mr. Trump is on his 3rd marriage, of which he proudly admits he cheated on his now wives and with other mistresses.  He makes tasteless sexual remarks about his own daughters.  He shows no respect to the women in his life that he should show ultimate respect to.  Mrs. Clinton made her decision regarding her marriage infidelity and for whatever reason chose to keep her marriage intact.  The Clinton's raised a daughter who is a college graduate and a successful working woman.  These are not insignificant issues when comparing a person's integrity and emotional ability to lead this nation.

On improving the economy, according to Bloomberg, rating the 12 postwar Presidents economic growth, Obama's economy rated ahead of George W Bush, Jimmy Carter, George HW Bush, & Tricky Dick Nixon which is not bad considering he took over George W Bush's economy, which was the 2nd worse economy in our nations history, only the great depression of the 1930's saw a worse economy. Regarding SNAP, George W Bush added 14.7 million SNAP users during his 2 terms and Obama added 13.4 million. Regarding the stock market, during Obama's first 100 days the stock market rose 8.4% compared to Trumps 5.5%. When Obama took office the DJIA was 7,949 and when he left it was 19,887 and on one day, August 14, 2017, all three major stock market indexes set records. Under Obama the unemployment rate went from 10% when he took office to 4.8% when Trump took office. So maybe you should do some homework before you post nonsense.....

Your buddy Trump probably has paid very little in tax in the last 20 years.  He's refused to release any tax returns, unlike any other nominee for decades. One that was supposedly """"leaked,"""" was probably released surreptitiously by him (was it 2005?), I presume because that was the one year he actually paid taxes.  One of the biggest items for the """"R""""s is eliminating payment of any estate taxes, which Frank Luntz had them retitling as """"death taxes.""""  They've had the % to be paid on them cut endlessly, and the first $5.49 million are exempted entirely.  So if someone built up a fortune in equity, and then died, it will transfer to their heirs, most of whom won't have to pay anything on the appreciation of assets before being passed on.  35 states have no estate tax. 44 have no inheritance tax.

I took the question Mr. Manion posed, """"Why praise a women's movement..."""" as an example of such elision. Hence my answer.  Some other items on women's agendas are: equity in work and wages, access to health care, societal support for the rearing and education of children, civil justice across ethnic and economic lines, and freedom from sexual insult and battery.  The women I know who attended the women's march, (the example of a """"Women's Movement"""" offered for discussion) were animated by a wide range of concerns. An objective observer might guess that Trump's """"locker-room talk,"""" and subsequent victory,  taken as indicative of a widespread attitude of disrespectful liberty towards women and their persons, was the galvanic force that made the march as big as it was. The recent """"#Me Too"""" uproar supports that view.

What you're not understanding is that the """"detainer request"""" for a 48-hour hold is a request to continue incarcerating people whose release time has been reached. It has nothing to do with simply notifying ICE of an upcoming release. Trump and Sessions want cities to refuse to release people who've made bail or finished their sentences for up to 48 additional hours.  Cities have been sued and lost for doing this in the past. THAT is why it is unconstitutional. Already decided, slam dunk.

The left simplistically has redefined the term to mean it is when massive numbers of voters support a conservative cause supported by the right and opposed by the left. Some of the official definitions of “fascist” say that it is a “right-wing” politician. So if you oppose racial quotas or gun control, you are a fascist. If you support traditional marriage, you are a fascist. If you want to cut welfare benefits, you are a fascist. If you support Donald Trump, you are a fascist. By this definition liberals can’t be fascists because theirs is a righteous cause, Without Barack Obama’s full slate of failures and his eight years of polarizing politics, there could be no Donald Trump.

0,"Trump held  three campaign rallies in different cites and even different states every day, and two on Saturday, for 3 months leading up to the election. Every rally had overflow attendance, in some cases as many thousands outside watching on jumbo-trons as inside. It barely registered with the general news media that he was making public appearances at all.  Hillary actually cancelled appearances in Oakland for lack of  attendance. One Hillary rally in Miami, at a soccer field, attracted less than 200 people.

Today he announces that he is again, not seeking re-election, and that he is indeed leaving early, June 30th to be exact, and considering possibly running for governor, (which leaving early to start campaigning for governor would be expected) and this all of a sudden raises doubts about the Trump probe?

0,"MisterAl:  I'm not quite sure whom you're addressing.  However,  one of my points addressed the impact of the Presidential candidate on down-ballot candidates.  Many voters do NOT simply vote """"party line"""", but do look at the candidates, and a strong leader on the ballot sets a supportive tone for down-ballot voting.  It helps to be associated with a """"good"""" candidate and hurts to be associated with a """"bad"""" one.  GOP candidates are realizing just how """"bad"""" a candidate Trump is and, fearing the damage from being associated with him, are distancing themselves.....and wisely so.  There's a real chance that Trump's candidacy may lose the GOP both the House and the Senate.  It's very difficult to lose the Presidency in a """"landslide"""" w/o negatively impacting those down-ballot races..and, at the rate he's going, Trump is headed for a landslide loss.

Anyone who has traveled to third world can understand what daily existence is there and why they'd want to flee.  But... as those of us who work full time and struggle pay check to pay check, we know how hard it is to maintain a decent lifestyle. When these Sudanese came, did they think that there would be certain benefits given to them or that they would be welcomed with open arms? This is a much different country than it was 100+ years ago when the Europeans fled to come here and right now there aren't that many of us with the energy to embrace the horde that is coming this way. In that way I think Trump is right. We need to make America great again (so that we can make room for those who will come.) If we open the gates now, it could very well bring us down.

You leave out completely the part the US has played in not supporting the economies/governments south of our border (we are paying a price for that pattern).

Two wrongs simply don't make a right. Our senators finally seem to have understood that, sometimes it's more important to put your country before your own party.

That sentence is fine in an opinion piece, but objectively, for a news report, it is nonsense and it is inappropriate.

Look around you at the many Christians you may know. Does this ring true? Are they all -- or are any of them -- racist?

0,"Understanding that Todd Stern was a Clinton appointee explains his motivation, but the drama presented by him and many others regarding the president's opting out of the Accord is beyond the pale. Even Obama did not take the agreement seriously. If he had, he would have taken it to the senate for ratification, but he did not because he knew the vote would fail. The point is, the president is in favor of good environmental policies, but is opposed to agreements of any kind, whether it be climate or trade, that are unfair and harmful to this country. Let's be honest, all of the commotion over the president's opting out of the Accord is not because an unenforceable, trillion dollar, non-binding, boondoggle idea has been scrapped, but because the liberal cause has seized upon it as an excellent opportunity to promote more anti-Trump vitriol.

The big problem with teaching Kim a lesson by attacking is that the U.S. has 26,000 or so American troops in S.Korea within U.S. Army and Air Force bases.  If Kim retaliates by attacking S.Korea, many of our GI's will die.  That will lead us to annihilate Pyongyang and we will be called the aggressor. The only practical way is to strike from within North Korea, with internal """"kill Kim"""" assassins.  Money, a great deal, talks.  Do to Kim like he did to his half-brother.

That said, it’s a dead cert that it is happening, and playing ostrich ain’t gonna fix it.  But it’s about more than carbon anyhow.  Coal is a filthy way to generate power, and creating a market for Appalachian dirt just can’t be good.  And I don’t think Trump has any respect for the environment --  CO2 is only one in a long list of worries.  I just can’t see the man embracing water conservation, meaning the aquifers that make Kansas fertile and the Colorado river are that much closer to drying up.  I agree that climate change accords have largely been ineffective, and you are probably right that falling emissions had more to do with a tanking economy than anything else.  But using that as an excuse to do nothing at all is juvenile and short sighted.

Polls shows that journalism is one of the least respected professions in the country, and with Trump calling out media organizations for their bias, widespread slanted reporting is bound to reinforce this point — and to backfire.

0,"To be expected.  Unlike President Obama, President Trump will not make speeches in which he telegraphs to the evil doers our intentions and time schedule for doing them. He will not do some """"if you cross this line you'll be in big trouble"""" nonsense. If he decides to take action it will be swift and decisive.

I am not condoning Trump's approach or some of his antics, but he is doing EXACTLY what he promised in his campaign, and the US electorate voted him in.  At the end of the day, he is likely better for us Canadians as Obama was no friend of Canadian industry and jobs.  And for those that forget, our schools, hospitals do need to be funded from somewhere. As much as we appreciate your apology, don't bother as it is not necessary.

0,"This is trump's way of distancing himself from this train wreck, of setting others up to take the heat.  What happened to his campaign promises of a great health plan, a plan in which more people, not fewer, would have much better--and less expensive--insurance coverage.  Let's remember that republicans had 7+ years to develop a replacement for the ACA. After 8 years of ruling, the party now finds itself unable to govern. The simple solution is to provide every American coverage at least as good as the president and those in congress have.

Generals tell him that won't work and advisors say that means leaving it to Russia (which he said more than once). But  Russia is part of a lot of the atrocities. Should we fight on in Syria and let Muslim extremists or Russians takeover? Trump is advocating going to the sidelines and leaving it to whoever, so Assad can unlease gas attack.

0,"The wiretapping issue is far more than a distraction.  It is clear that the president is willing to make unsubstantiated claims to involve Congress in his absurd tweeting.  We now see Congress wasting time investigating Donald's tweet.  Congress truly had no choice as they either had to investigate or appears to support Trump by letting his claim stand unchallenged.  Too some that might not matter but to the many, including myself, I see this as how Trump will do the same thing in the future when he wants to distract citizens and ties Congress into wasting more time than the already do on non-issues. In-the-end I hope this leads Congress to focus on Trump and his never ending disruptions to our legislative processes.  Politics is a unique blend of personality and credibility. Trump is slowly trying to discredit everyone's credibility. He is forcing a wide swath of long term Congressional delegates, media personalities, and others to take positions that are career makers or breakers.

Also, there were hack of phones of foreign leaders friends and foes. Including German Chancellor, president of Brazil, Spanish and French leaders. All leaked by Wikileaks. Obama apologized, but the damage severe. Germany overhauled intelligence, while Brazil president cancelled WH visit and purchase of Boeing fighter jets. His denial has no credibility.

To my American friends, I say with all sincerity; too bad about the incipient fascism (the leader fixation, the mixing of private and public business in both cabinet and the Oval Office, the authoritarian tone, the pro-business corporatist approach to policy) the hand over of the levers of government to the religious right and the inclusion of all the conspiracy theorists, false news believers/propagators and climate change deniers into prominent positions in the new administration.  And let's not forget the racism, Trump's in-yer-face style of lying and his tendency to announce new policy directions as if issuing decrees.

If you want what's best for America, it's Clinton. If you want what's best for you, it's Clinton. We as a nation can more readily survive a four-year extension of Obama's administration than we can actual literal fascism.
"
0,"I am sure you're right - for now. It took almost 2 years after the conclusion of the watergate investigations before Nixon resigned. Clinton managed to complete his term without being impeached because the process is so drawn out. Even if the democrats managed to get articles of impeachment drawn up and get enough republicans to sign on (this is becoming ever more possible) there is no chance it will not be an equally slow and drawn out process. More likely the republicans will keep running interference for Trump to cash in on their devil's bargain with him to get rich people to pay even less taxes. So in reality, it's likely actual impeachment won't get started unless the democrats can take at least one house in 2018 - that is extremely likely and getting moreso by the day. Liberals in America have never been better organised or energised or effective. But by then - the best it's likely to do is deprive him a second term. I hate that, but it's the reality.

It's, in my opinion rather imoral for such """"stars"""" to take advantage of such women, but, then I'm a bit of a prig on such matters.  Trump's behavior, as chronicled in his famous boasting, and as alleged in the cases of the ten or so women who have come forward, is very different.

What I hope is that many of his statements are similar to say a labor negotiator that starts with absurd request for benefits in hoping that they might get half of what they wanted and that would look like compromise.  I haven 't read the art of the deal, but I did have a good friend who worked briefly as a arbitrator in labor disputes.    Much of what Pres. Trump does is very calculated.

There were never thousands of violent liberals as the conservative blogs sphere would like to have us believe. Besides, what is important is the messages Trump has brought that certain, formerly inappropriate activities are somehow now acceptable.

0,"No, he didn't abuse his power, they did.  They ratified it to a degree that he can't veto it.  So he signed it.  It was all political, which was my point and still is.  It was a show-vote and Trump is a pragmatist.  So he signed it for show too.  Just like failing obamacare is a show vote for McCain the traitor, and Trump said """"OK...you own it!""""  Don't worry, Trump is going to keep moving forward. Congress is doing the opposite and will ultimately pay the price.  No big thing, Trump will just go around the rocks whenever he feels like it.  And you are wrong about your assertion that Congress is in charge of foreign affairs...they aren't.  Ratifiying treaties and foreign aid is not anywhere near the powers that the POTUS has.  He can appoint Ambassadors, invade countries, start wars within limits, and end them. He can also  reccomend and veto legislation and negotiate treaties.  Congress has to confirm these things of course, but they are not on the front line of the negotiations.

This kind of Catholic Americhristianity is in fact unChristian and certainly also unAmerican.  Pope Francis may indeed have to intervene with an Encyclical addressing first and foremost the Church in the US, yet of course the universal church as well.

At the moment, many election models predict a Trump victory over any currently known candidate for the next presidential election. The idea that the electorate can or will coalesce around someone who can beat Trump was tested in 2015-16, and failed repeatedly. The will of the majority right now seems to be swayed by pop culture, not by Catholic social teaching and values. If the course of history is going to change, we need to do more than point out the failures of our elected officials. We need to identify and support candidates who can win. At the moment, I don't see anyone on the horizon, and the models are reflecting that. (Remember that models are not polls.) A lot can happen between now and then, but the idea that a decent, intelligent, experienced politician will emerge and win the day -- may be more a dream than an aspiration.

Post-national societies are a dreamworld of disconnected idealists in academia and professional activists. Trump was elected on campaign promises that represent an unapologetic contempt for progressive idealism - Trump rejects the idea that there is no such thing as illegal immigrants and is going to enforce strong borders. This policy is especially unfair to Iraqi interpreters who risked their lives to work for the US but time will tell if they will allow exceptions (it is a temporary ban). Europe has shown what happens when laissez-faire political impotence and good intentions define immigration policy - countries end up with segregated boroughs hostile to a common culture (Rotherham, Molenbeek, Paris, Malmo, etc.).

On the other hand, I am completely consistent in my views. What he did to Hillary's campaign was wrong. Obama should have fired him. Creating and leaking a memo about Trump was wrong. Both actions were politically motivated, self-serving, and grandstanding.  If he worked for me I would have fired him too. The FBI Director is supposed to be non-political and simply serve as the administrative head of the agency.  He is not supposed to be a publicity-seeking, arrogant politician. I'm glad he's gone.

There are two ways (at least) in which denial can get in our way as we go forward: 1.) We can't deny the fact that this man has been elected. For sure, we need to study the election and understand what happened. But we have to accept the outcome. 2.) We can't deny or minimize how dangerously incompetent the president-elect is. We can't indulge a thought that begins with """"Maybe it won't be so bad."""" We need to trust our Constitution and our democratic institutions, believing that they are sturdy enough to restrain and contain the worst impulses of this reckless, dangerous man.

0,"Trump's actions towards immigrants and particularly refugees are disgraceful. So-called Christian evangelical hypocrites that turned a blind eye on his disgusting behaviour towards everyone imaginable are gleefully smacking their lips.  In the end, America will become more hated than it already is now.  Canada has shown the world how to treat refugees.  We have a long history of humanitarian support for people who are disenfranchised.  Vietnamese boat people who came to Canada have made Canada their home and have risen up to support this great country. American conscientious objectors who came to Canada have contributed greatly to Canada.  Every waking hour, there are millions of Canadians old and new like myself who silently pray and thank God for being Canadians. Thank God I don't live in the United States soon, """"The Land of the Flee"""". (poetic licence)

0,"Mr. Trump hasn't changed over the years.  His personal, business and entertainment history is well-documented.  I really think his Presidential candidacy was a """"lark"""" run-amok.  His """"screw 'um all"""" persona  struck a respondent chord with a sizeable faction of disaffected right-wing Americans and now he's the GOP Presidential candidate.  He refuses to """"ratchet it down"""" and ignores the pleas from Republicans (many of them down-ballot GOP candidates) to be at least a little less offensive.  Those pleas are wasted. Those down-ballot candidates are distancing themselves from Trump as gracefully as possible.  I'm always reminded of the story of the frog and the scorpion.... The GOP knew what Trump was when they nominated him.  He certainly hasn't tried to """"misrepresent"""" himself.  What you see is what you get...truth in packaging..

0,"U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister May seem concerned with security and terrorism issues. They could lessen these issues considerably by following the common sense of the latest attacker - on Manchester. He is quoted as saying that he was acting because Britain had attacked Libya, Syria and other Muslims. Revenge.  It makes sense. One country attacks another and citizens and friends of the country that was attacked can be expected to strike back. All the countries which have been attacked, including US, France, Germany, Britain, Canada have troops fighting in the Middle East area. So it should have been no surprise that they were attacked.  Thus if countries took their troops out of the area, revenge strikes should decrease. No western nation has an obvious interest in that area, so little would be lost, and a lot of lives saved.  May and Trump could spend their time healing their very fractured countries, caused by Brexit and Trump.

0,"We don't need unskilled immigration anymore (farmers, factory workers). We have lots of unskilled labour here already. Robots will replaced all the unskilled labour (see mcdonalds, truckdrivers).  Low skilled immigration creates a false economy, companies don't need to increase wages because refugees will work for less than min wage (see Mexicans in USA).  Companies should be forced to increase wages until the labour supply for the job = demand (see meat rendering plants).  When wages are suppressed, inflation kept low, profits up, average income down, quality of life down, CEO pay way, way up.  Look up productivity gains vs wage gains, decoupled in 74(ish), productivity up 241%, wages up 112%, who pockets the gap, CEO's of course (otherwise, no gap). http://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/  Instead of spending billions on refugees, spend billions on retraining - why do you think Trump got elected...

0,"Given the size of Trump's companies, the likelihood than any of his tax position would be considered criminal is highly unlikely. He is likely under audit as his CPA's have advised him to take certain tax positions that the IRS is trying to evaluate. Even if the IRS determines he can't substantiate the tax position, these are gray areas and would be far from criminal.  What we know is criminal is sending emails with classified information outside of the secured network. Recklessness (or disregard to national security) is a bigger issue than looking at Trump's tax returns. Trump isn't required to submit it, so don't submit it. It is his choice.  At this point, with the media and dems attacking """"everything"""", why would he release them and open himself up for more scrutiny. Besides, given the corporate structuring he has, his tax returns wouldn't show an accurate picture of his businesses anyways. Tax returns only show annual income, not wealth. Wealth = assets minus debts, not income

He called our free press the enemy of the American people, and he wants to force everyone to say """"Merry Christmas."""" He is opposed to the First Amendment and everything it says.  So don't lecture me on on supporting the First Amendment if you support Trump. You've already made your stance perfectly clear.

0,"Just to be clear, I don't believe a word that comes out of Trump's mouth... so the content of his speech is irrelevant to me.  It is the actions he takes that will determine his impact as President.  That being said, it is HILARIOUS to watch all of Canada's poorly educated immigration hawks stumble all over themselves when they come to the realization that the model Canada follows is actually envied by other countries.  Most of these hawks see people sneaking across the border and they confuse immigrants with refugees.  Their knowledge is largely superficial and based on biased viewpoints like Rebel.  Canada's immigration policy delivers us great contributors to our society.  Further, our sponsored refugee policy is also admired around the world for doing a great job of helping refugees integrate into our society. I think it's time Canada's immigration hawks set aside their petty biases and learn what's going on instead of just complaining about it.

Maybe the real press will remember the roots of their profession and expose  the crimes of partisianship and purchased influence.    President Trump might even support that philosophically.

Although a Republican campaign May have first engaged Fusion GPS to conduct op research against Trump during the primary, Steele was not brought to do the dossier focused on Russia until Hillary and the DNC took over. The trash that the report produced is now the basis of at least 5 libel or defamation suits on two continents against Steele, Fusion GPS, and/or BuzzFeed. In the British suit, Steele, under oath, ran away from his own findings saying they were all unverified and should. never have been released by Fusion GPS. According to recent reports, Mueller's investigation is now focused on Manafort's and Podesta's fraudulent Russia work that has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.

The ruling in 1972 said abortion in the first 12 weeks is Constitutionally protected .  After 12 weeks states could impose regulations. To overturn the right to an abortion in the first 12 weeks should require an Amendment.  That is why progressive liberals who want to protect abortion should stop fussing about President-elect Trump and more about the fact they are losing control of the state legislatures.  Since 2008 when President Obama was inaugurated there have been 910 state legislative seats that switched from Dem to Rep.  There are only 13 states with Democratically controlled legislatures (26%).  Lose one more, and assuming that 100% of the Republican legislators vote for it, there is a good chance of right to life Constitutional  amendment.

0,"Call it family values, Christian values, personal integrity or whatever you like. I consider myself to lucky to have be taught that when one is wrong one should admit it as opposed to lying in an attempt to cover it up. Then the correct course is to apologize to those who were wronged. Not taking step two is what most people would call a half hearted or disingenuous apology. Do this and things always go better for both parties involved and there is some closure. Mr. Trump seems to have never learned these two basic things. He is surrounded by yes men and women who fear him enough to never be critical and never say a mistake might have been made or an apology might be warranted. I suppose you can run a business empire that way and fire those who do not agree with you but this is where business and politics differ. Politicians, being elected to pubic not private office, need to act differently. I doubt Trump will ever learn what most people already know. A habitual offender. Next case...

Pavone is a right-wing nut-job, financed by wealthy right-wing nut jobs, and thus the bishops are intimidated by him.

The stunt itself may have made the bishop squirm a little bit, but there seems little doubt that many American bishops, probably most of them, endorsed Pavone's endorsement of Trump. It's a shame that so many Trump voters claimed the """"pro-life"""" tag in support of the most militantly anti-life, pro-death president in history. It was and is an Orwellian abuse of language. Meanwhile, the bishops' approach to LGBT persons, families and issues is -- with some individual exceptions -- also anti-life, tragically so.

But for nearly 8 million families -- including a majority of single-parent households -- the opposite would occur: They'd pay more.  Most married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found. And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, they'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America's richest 1 percent.  The tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status. These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income.

Ivanka Trump said: """"There’s no policy on Hillary Clinton’s website pertaining to any of these issues, childcare, eldercare, or maternity leave or paternity leave for that matter” Donald said, Clinton “has no child care plan” and “never will.” But these plans have been on Clinton's website for over a year.  The Trump's statements are facts and Clinton's details on these issues have been posted.  That the fact checkers reporting this are biased, is probably true, but has no relevance to this issue. It's a red herring. This works both ways. I may believe Fox News is biased, but they are capable of telling the truth. Fact checkers just bring us the details. And the details showed the Trump's lied.

0,"As the election booklet shows, there are many other candidates besides Hillary and Trump.   Johnson, the most experienced fiscally conservative governor (Gov. Veto) along with his running mate, fiscally conservative Bill Weld, both two-term governors, are the people that I would hire to do the job.   Yes, they were left out of the pamphlet.   If it wasn't for Johnson's two gaffes, you would have never even heard of Johnson; that's how scared the two major parties are!   If he's such an ignoramus, why is he not in the Presidential Debates?   Surely, Hillary and Trump would have nothing to fear by his appearance.   (But, like the Pauls, if he was in the debates the commentators would try to embarrass him.)   Get a clue, people.

0,"This article is an excellent example of the collision of two worlds of facts.   The legal facts presented by the author from the world of a social elite and the almost never mentioned facts from the world at large.  The facts in this world relate to lower job quality, higher debt, poorer prospects for young people, higher housing costs, lower quality of life, plummeting equality levels and losses on every environmental front.  Globalism, a broken financial system, and mass immigration are the major drivers of these metrics of decline.  The elites feel they simply have to explain their position more clearly or come down harder on concern and activism (now smeared as """"populism"""") to facilitate conformity and compliance.  There  is simply no comprehension of the structural problems their law making and enlightened approach will not heal.  They don't realize they are railing against the symptoms.

They actually HAD multiple meetings, and Trump campaign/administration officials lied about them. 4. Some people in the Trump campaign telegraphed the content of emails before the Russians released them, and Trump helped the Russians by publicizing them. 5. The Russians ran a widespread and sophisticated propaganda operation on us in social media, and Trump again helped publicize their propaganda in his tweets and stump speeches.

Ideally the 60k workers would become just that rather than a lot of warm bodies.

While the released media, gives air to the words of Trump, the words in the emails of  Clinton & team are most disturbing. Especially in the method of undermining the Catholic Church, that she claims to have such high respect for.  Time has shown that planting the seeds of disunity in the Church, especially to cause division between clergy & laity, was carefully orchestrated for political & personal gain. A cold blooded, carefully thought out plan, to divide the Church & marginalize it so as to reduce any opposition to the political end game.  I can tolerate Trump's hot air, far more then the methodical plan the opposition party had in play before Trump came on the scene.

This is a sure sign that Trump is looking for a place and an excuse to wage war -- that has been John Bolton's main function in government service.  Trump lied (everyone knows that he lied: it's preserved on tape)  when he said that he had opposed the invasion of Iraq.  More important, he lied when he said that he would not lead the United States into another similar war.  Trump’s fragile adolescent male ego requires a war; more than that, he knows that he needs a war to distract the media and the public from the massive transfer of wealth, resources and opportunities from the bottom 98% to the top 2% which will be occurring on his watch. Reporting today suggests that Bolton may not be nominated, or may not be confirmed if he is nominated. Still, Trump's interest in Bolton tips his hand.

They are salacious and are meant to sell the news and also chip away and Trump's credibility.  In Canada and Britain, and most Western democracies they would be considered illegal (cabinet secrecy) or grounds for dismissal (leaks from intelligence officials).  They have to be dealt with...and truth be told, the media cannot decide who will be President.  That is what they have elections for.

As for the contraception issue, most married (presumably) Catholics  use artificial contraception, so whose religious liberties are at stake here? Not all Christian ministers are taken in by Trump's rhetoric. The issue is whether the religious liberties of clergy are to be given the right to dominate the public square to the exclusion of others who may have a better claim to moral integrity. It is helpful to have access to secular media such as NPR, where one will find another take on what Protestant clergy have had to say about Trump's view of religious liberty and the relationship between Church and State. It was the New York Times that informed me that Steve Bannon is a right-wing Catholic, not the NCR. Were it not for Pope Francis I would say Church is going to hell in a hand basket.

Makes you wonder why the U.S. government spends hundreds of millions a year preparing the very best information and advice for the president when, at the end of the day, he tweets out decisions from the Oval Office based on last night's CNN line-up.  No doubt senior advisors are still trying to convince Trump the White House Situation Room is better than Wolf Blitzer's.

There are no near term prospects of things getting much better either, not until major budgetary outlays can be conjured up to massively expand law enforcement resources in the UK.  Those who seek to blame all this on our PRESIDENT are merely confessing to have succumbed to TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) and should seek psychiatric intervention.

They recognize that you can't have a jobless transition.  Trump is not against clean energy development, he's just planning to lower taxes and let the market decide what it wants to build.

Some say Putin has between $40-$60 billion. Some say it's closer to $200 billion. He can afford to do almost anything. AG Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is now a suspect in the muddy waters of the Trump-Russia connection because he lied during his confirmation hearing when he said he did not have contact with Russian agents. Sessions met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Russia's top spy recruiter. He may be on Putin's payroll. He could be a Russian spy.  We also need to look at Trump's tax returns since the 1990s to see if there's been any Russian money involved in Trump's 30-year global business experience and interests. Indeed his son has already admitted the Trump Organization gets a significant pile of money from Russia. The Russia-Putin-Trump deal is about tons of money. So is Session's lie.

The popular vote was Clinton 65,844,954 (48.2%) to Trump 62,979,879 (46.1%).  But of course its the electoral college that matters.  Trump barely edged out Clinton in three swing states (10,704 votes in Michigan, 22,177 in Wisconsin and 67,416 votes in Pennsylvania) to win the electoral college.  Those margins of votes total less than a tenth of one percentage point of everyone who voted across the nation.  My point is not to belittle Trump's win in the electoral college but rather point out that hackers would need to only effect some elections in key swing states.

He's not just a side show, he's the whole circus: clowns, elephants and balloons.  Pence wouldn't be like that.  Republicans would love to see a Pence presidency.  Anyway the articles for impeachment would have to start in the House.  The same House that just passed his healthcare ban.  That ain't going nowhere.

When Bush dropped out, and Trump won the Republican nomination, Fusion GPS then shopped their investigation around and ended up with an attorney with connections to both the DNC and the HRC campaign picking up the tab.  HOWEVER, there is almost NO indication that either the DNC or the HRC campaign ever saw the materials developed by Fusion GPS.  In fact, the HRC campaign chairman said a few months ago that he WISHED they had had access to the information found in the dossier during the campaign.

Interspersed with some things that make sense, there is a lot that makes little or no sense, and seems to be in the legislation because of successful lobbying efforts by specific constituencies to serve their own interests.  Essentially, congressional representatives  saying, """"I'll vote for this if you give me that thing I want.""""

More, if they have a home office as millions today spend part of the week working from home with the employers' blessings. Their Schedule A will now be reduced to $24,000 and they will also lose their exemption deduction of $8,100. All this means roughly $24,000 of their income will now be exposed to taxation (and it is not at the present time). That's about $6,000 more in taxes, or $6,000 less in tax refunds.

1,"The crux of all these protests is this: Predominantly black athletes providing an escape from reality to a predominantly white audience indifferent to police brutality suffered by the black community. When unarmed African-Americans repeatedly get killed by white police officers, who largely go unpunished by the justice system, at some point the black community (including professional athletes) starts to interpret the evidence as """"state-sponsored"""" police brutality. The flag is a potent symbol of the political system. Aside from 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick, most black athletes swallowed hard and remained silent, then President Trump went to Alabama, of all places, and called athletes who kneel during the national anthem """"sons of bitches"""" (sic) and called for their """"firing."""" How can predominantly black athletes continue to provide their predominantly white audience an escape from Trump's polluted reality show by worshipping the flag he represents?

Of course, there is the production of CO2 from  but heck, who believes the earth is warming, or even that it is human caused? There is always the option to move to coal states to save money if one does not like the rates here. And one could get a job mining coal as Trump is creating these jobs.

Obama based his order on identifying terrorists and potential terrorists no matter whether they came from the six countries Trump listed or some other country. It was more important under the Obama order to see where a person went than where he was from. For example, someone could be from Canada, but if they visited Syria multiple times they would be flagged as a potential terrorist who may have attended terrorist training camps. No constitutional issues-- Trump stop being stubborn and be smart.

Dourson would also be in a position to make decisions affecting chlorpyrifos, another pesticide he’s been paid to research, which can cause memory, intelligence, attention, and motor problems in children.   The EPA proposed banning chlorpyrifos in 2016.  In research paid for by Dow, the manufacturer of chlorpyrifos, Dourson came up with a safety threshold that was some 5,000 times less protective than what the EPA recommended for children between the ages of one and two.

As for financial contributions, the US is the hegemonic power in this relationship, and as such, is expected to front the lions share of the costs in exchange for Canada giving up some of its sovereignty and letting the US take a leadership role in North American defense and in identifying perceived threats abroad.

I have no desire to demonize him, but I cannot figure out for the life of me why he is insisting upon dividing our church along these lines. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, and praying father forgive them for they know not what they do, my first reaction was somewhat akin to yours concerning your political opponents.

0,"Trump is not a big thinker. He seems to make decisions on impulse rather than careful thought.  I don't know what he will do with this one. Do you antagonize Turkey, a NATO partner with a strategic geographic location or support Kurdish fighters who have done the bulk of the fighting in Iraq and Syria?  I don't know who I trust least Trump or Erdogan. I just know that Putin will come out smelling like roses and """"the enemy of my enemy are my friends (i.e. Kurds)"""".

0,"Trump and many on his associates operated as international business people of decades. These individuals didn't necessarily document each and every meeting with foreign official. Documenting each meeting, who was at that meeting and what was discussed, was not something they normally did. When I was working oversea I had numerous meeting and social events with Chinese officials, and I would be hard pressed to recall everyone at each meeting and what was discussed by each person. Take the  CEO in any company and ask them to recall each meeting and social event they had, who was there, who did they talk to and what was discussed. That is exactly what happen with the individuals you mentioned.

1,"I would talk about the lies you spread about Hillary, but I really need to talk about something else.  You personally were against trans using the same bathrooms as women because they might be groped. You are now excusing someone who is in court for the rape of a 13 year old and openly stated he groped women.  Christianity Today, the largest evangelical mag, dropped Trump due to him being very non-Christ like.  You are literally advocating for someone that is talking about sexual assault.  Let me spell it out. Saying """"She has a nice ass"""" is different that 'Grab them by the p***y...they can't say no cause your are rich and powerful.  Until you understand the difference please step aside and let real honorable men have a conversation about how women should be treated.  I as a man refuse to be lumped into the category as those that abuse women.  Learn what consent is.

0,"Bill Clinton  treated women in a disgusting and exploitive way. When Bill Clinton was running for President Hillary ran a “war room” to crack down on  “bimbo eruptions.” There were many accusations of sexual assaults committed by Bill Clinton over the years including the Monica Lewinsky episode of oral sex under the Presidential Desk.  Hillary attacked and humiliated every one of Bill's accusers.  She called them every insulting name including trailer park trash,  right wing conspirators, liars and crazy.  Hillary and Bill ruined the lives of dozens of women.  Bill Clinton was forced to surrender his law license for lying under oath.  Cigars and it all depends on the meaning of """"Is"""".

And the country Trump is inheriting is in a heck of a lot better shape that what Obama inherited, so I have no idea of what you mean by """"the country might have a chance now"""". At any rate, people's support of Trump seems more based on belief and hope rather than what he is actually doing. I just don't see how people can ignore the guy's behavior and some of the things that come out of his mouth. Saying things contradicted by the facts and that are simply not true; blaming others and saying derogatory things about any who criticize him; and going on about how how he has been the most persecuted president in history - it's embarrassing and not true. I have never seen a president consistently behave and talk in such an immature manner. I don't respect or have faith in him.

Like the Islamic terrorists who are radicalized by I.S.I.S. in mosques all over the world, those people who I have mentioned above that hate President Trump to such an extreme, are certainly responsible for radicalizing the gunman, James T.

Pierre inherited an Armed forces of 101,000 people with an Aircraft Carrier, 24 Destroyers and destroyer escorts, three tankers, and an Army of 4 Full Brigade groups with over 400 fast Jet combat aircraft. He left office with 20 very old ships,an Army cut in half  and 138 New F-188 Hornets to replace the 400 older jets.  Harper INCREASED Strategic and tactical airlift ,The Leopard Tanks, while rebuilding the LAV fleet and Halifax class. Harper left the forces in relatively good shape and the Liberals agreed with him as they deferred 3.4 Billion in funds thereby confirming that they felt the tools in the box were sufficient. The Election of Trump has changed that calculation.

0,"Just because Trump has been opposed to trade deals doesn't mean he knows that much about them. Angela Merkel was forced to explain the “fundamentals” of EU trade to Donald Trump 11 times after he repeatedly asked to do a deal directly with Germany, a senior German official claimed. The US President reportedly exposed """"very basic misunderstandings"""" of how EU trade works during a meeting with the German chancellor, the official said. And from Globe editorial: """"We ... don’t know yet to what degree Mr. Trump even understands the stakes in the game he is playing. He is a practised television showman, and he has developed some real estate, but he has never been involved with manufacturing or had to navigate the intricacies of international trade."""" Multiple bankruptcies in casinos and real estate doesn't mean he knows anything about international trade.

"
0,"You are not thinking rationally.  The NYT does not know Trump's position on Iraq all those years ago.  T hey simply do not.  When there is a lack of conclusive evidence, you don't say somebody lied.  If you do, you are the liar.  The crowd stuff is more media BS.  Trump said the crowd was massive.  This is a non-statement in that it is not quantitative, i.e. it is a matter of opinion.  Regarding total audience, he may have been talking about the true total audience, i.e. including media distributed coverage.  Only a partisan hack would assert that non-quantitative and ambiguous comments are lies.  The sad thing in addition is that it doesn't matter.  The media made a non-issue an issue.  Pathetic.  And a person who is wrong is not a liar unless they know they are wrong.  Trump speaks off the cuff quite a bit and he is not particularly precise which the media tortures into lies.  But in the end, except for partisans like you, the media makes itself look bad for the pettiness.

0,"Maybe I've lived a less sheltered life than Mr. Pope.  I've had occasion over the years to hear at least a dozen male conversations similar to the one in question.  Maybe half were when I was in Vietnam, where most of the described action was with prostitutes. (Query: is it OK for men to talk about prostitutes that way?)  But the others were in Anchorage; one involved some significant business and professional people.  Another was on a fishing charter out of Homer.  No, these conversations weren't exactly like Trump's.  Except for one story involving a prostitute, they didn't describe assaults.  And nobody claimed to be a star who could grab women at will.  But they all involved graphic sexual boasts. Aside from prostitutes, these men were describing sex with wives and girlfriends, past and present.  Completely apart from men boasting, who do you think is supporting a porn industry that takes in between $10 and $20 billion per year--for a product that is very often degrading to women?

0,"Everyone ridiculing, insulting and guilt-tripping those on the fence about voting for Hillary Clinton are not helping the cause to defeat Donald Trump. This blaming, fear tactic was used during the 2000 & 2004 elections and helped get us two terms of George W. Bush. Respect people's personal political views and give them reasons to vote for Hillary Clinton and/or work for the defeat of Donald Trump.  Insults and threats will only push people away and make it more likely that Donald Trump ends up as president (shudder). While it might make you feel good to condemn these folks, you are being counter-productive. Think about the people that have supported Bernie Sanders, they are anti-establishment folks that aren't going to react well to insults and threats. Stay respectful and provide plenty of reasons to support HRC and we will find that a vast majority of Bernie supporters will end up voting for Clinton and help us keep the dangerous, racist demagogue out of the White House.

Should be pretty clear Kushner carries no greetings from the US Congress  Talks managed or involving high level professional US, Israeli and relvant Palestinian diplomats and officials are stalled.  Sending in Ivanka's husband is nothing more than a photo opp. for all involved.  This is a PR move to burnish Kushner's reputation as someone who has """"served"""" the US, and played an important governmental role or purpose.  When the facts start coming aout about Kushner's 30 something responses to the shiny things Russian was dangling in front of him (and then, the cover up/obstruction efforts), the PR will help at least Trump's base accept the pardon.  Grandpa will have something to spin to the grandkids about how their father was just about to cause Middle East peace but was treated unfairly by the fake media.
"
1,"I wasn't alive during JFK's presidency, but was during Clinton's. A big difference I see between them and Trump is that their proclivities weren't known before they got elected; Trump has five children from three marriages, is an admitted adulterer, and has bragged that it's okay to """"grab women by the pussy"""" without their consent, all BEFORE getting elected. He has also said his government will repeal the Affordable Care Act - which will leave many women without access to birth control because they don't have health insurance and can't afford it - and has said he is anti-abortion, hopes to get Roe vs. Wade repealed, and plans to defund Planned Parenthood. This isn't women whining about vicitimisation; this is women fearing hard-won rights will be taken away from them.
"
0,"It's the guns vs butter approach in growing an economy. The American Navy is currently at 272 ships. Under the current 30-year shipbuilding plan, it's expected to reach 308 ships but that would require $4.5 billion dollars additional spending in annual shipbuilding than has been budgeted for.  Donald Trump has pledged to increase the US Navy to 350 ships. That would mean another additional $4 billion dollars in annual shipbuilding costs. Building these ships will cost at least $10 billion dollars more every year and it has to come from somewhere.  Clearly Donald Trump believes that building more warships will increase blue collar jobs in navy shipyards. As to their purpose of more warships, it's to intimidate the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, etc. We're likely to see a carrier task force continually maintained in the South China Sea or the Black Sea.

0,"Here's how you stop a Trump: per capita economic growth and greater relative economic equality. Western leaders at the end of World War II understood this, perhaps because the experience of fascism and communism was still close and they understood what made for their appeal. Without growth and greater equality  people will tend to see society as a zero sum game of conflicting interest groups rather than as a cooperative venture of mutual benefit.  Our elites, both left and right have lost sight of this recently.

0,"Orally, one judge suggested the Administration could slow processing of Visas while updating the program for security. He questioned why the Visa Program evaluation report was not completed because it was already due under the first Executive Order.  In 2011, the Obama Administration updated the vetting for Iraqi refugees, slowing entry from 18,251 in 2010 to 6,339 in 2011. Judge Watson's ruling that the Order is not discriminatory on its face, but is invalid due to implied intention has unintended consequences. Can the courts now halt drone attacks in the Mideast based on Trump's implied ill will towards Muslims? Is Trump hostile towards Muslims? He said at the National Prayer meeting, """"We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered, and oppressed by ISIS killers."""" He said his tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture “was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.”

0,"Incorrect. 1) You know those sanctions that Obama placed on Russia in December (you know...the ones Trump is likely to reverse)?  What do you think those were for? 2) Trump was saying that if he lost the election, it was because it was rigged.  If Obama came out in September or October and told the American public that Russia was trying to meddle in the election in favor of Trump, how would have you and your fellow Trump devotees reacted?  Be honest. 3) Russian hackers targeted state voting systems in (I think) 21 states, and yet weren't able to change results.  Seems to me that Obama DID do something.....unless you think we should have sent over SEAL Team 6 to kidnap the hackers.

What Trump did not do was to place the responsibility of starting the violence on those neo-Nazis and white supremacists who traveled from different parts of the country to Charlottesville for the express purpose of defending white Nationalism.  What Trump did not do was to exclude the peaceful protesters from that responsibility of starting the violence. Their reaction to the neo-Nazis could only be considered """"violent"""" if you deny them the right of self-protection. Everyone knows this.

I heard a interview yesterday on a radio program of three people from a small western Pennsylvania town and they all vote either for Trump or against Hillary but one of the guys ended the interview with saying that he hopes that Trump doesn't cut off his health insurance from the ACA.   You have to wonder how many millions of others are border line stupid like that guy.

Moreover, I suggest you try a test on progressive control of the media.  Log in to the RGs website and look at the last 10-20 or 100 opinion pieces published regarding Trump.  Tally those with positive things to say in one column and negative things to say in another column.  If your count ends up like mine, you will have about 90 percent of the opinion pieces with an anti-Trump message.  Such a lopsided opposition to Trump does not represent the feeling of American citizens who are much more evenly divided.  It does not matter who owns the media.  It matters only who works there and their political feelings.  As long as the """"news"""" organization makes money selling its progressive message, its owners will be totally happy.

Perhaps Alaskans who are Trump supporters- and those who definitely do not support him- can tell us what they think about Lisa Murkowski being unwilling to tell you if she endorses/supports Donald Trump, and whether she will vote for him?

If it was about business, then there was nothing to lie about. If it was about national security matters, then having businessmen and slimy Russian go-betweens (and keeping these meetings secret from American intel) as the only participants hardly is logical.

This can be confirmed by the stream of media recording Trump's appearances and utterances, by reading background on Steven Bannon and the Breitbart site itself, and by the rhetoric and agitprop of their more demonstrative supporters, which tends to take the form of swastikas and racist slurs.

0,"Mike, you should pick up a copy of """"Nixonland"""" by Rick Perlstein.  You will learn some history.  The Nixon that you describe as a grandfatherly figure was a shameless opportunist who forged what became the modern Republican Party by drawing in the John Birch Society element and the white Southern Democrats who couldn't forgive a Democratic president for the Civil Rights Act, and coupling them with Movement Conservatives, who actually had some good ideas and who accomplished some of them by ignoring the people they were depending on for votes.  Nixon created a coalition that dominated national politics for decades, but in doing so he planted the seeds that are now destroying the very party he empowered.  Donald Trump isn't the result of the Tea Party or of the evangelicals (who Reagan brought in and who, while they have their failings, aren't generally racist).  What you are seeing is Nixon's Republican Party coming to full term.  The Devil has come back to collect his due.

A bit of reading of recent history reveals how much wealthy Americans, British and Canadians admired, supported and encouraged Hitler and the Nazis in the 30's and 40's. And they like them so much, they welcomed Nazi war criminals into their countries in the 50's. That's the great thing about Trump\s fascism - if one scratches the surface of the establishment's relentless scapegoating of Donald Trump, one discovers he is only saying blatantly what A, B and C have been doing since the 1920 days of Mussolini. Oh, yeah, the rich and powerful are supposed to be so compassionate, multicultural, and anti-racist now, but Nazism and white supremacy are still very effective for the same purposes they were in the 1930's.

Close the so-called “Charleston Loophole.” Ban semi-automatic “assault weapons.” Clinton has said her gun proposals are “consistent with constitutional rights,” acknowledging that gun owners have a constitutional right to own guns.

0,"I'm not sure you understand how the United States government works. The President doesn't wield unyielding power. In fact, the Executive Office is supposed to work in conjunction with Congress and the Supreme Court to ensure a system of checks and balances. Yes the President can issue Executive Orders but they are done so in the fashion of directing a part of the Executive Branch on how to operate. Now Congress and especially the Supreme Court can declare orders unconstitutional or override them with new laws, and Executive Orders cannot override laws enacted by Congress.  So in any case the government operates by way of a system of checks and balances, with each branch having different types of power, all holding each other in check. What Trump has done, however, is impose his will by way of ousting opposition in the Executive Office and surrounding himself with his cronies. He's running close to a dictatorship, and that is awfully scary.

1,"Trump's first bluff with China was his blunder over the One China policy, and he folded like a house of cards, causing the Chinese to laughingly proclaim him a paper tiger. The armada bluff was similarly disastrous. You have to be as naive as Trump to think that the Chinese don't know where US aircraft carriers are at all times — and that they don't share that information with North Korea. Calling the armada story a bluff is giving Trump too much credit; more likely it was a spontaneous lie that left the White House staff scrambling to provide cover for him. When the inevitable happened — Trump's lie was exposed — Trump just looked like a fool, again.

0,"Why then, instead of accusing me of """"hyperventilating"""" and in need of a paper bag, did you not bother to check up to confirm that during his campaign, Trump promised to raise tariffs to bring back American jobs: 35% on Mexico and 45% on China. http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/22/investing/trump-stock-market-rally-ignores-promises/ So, I am merely repeating Trump's promises. I'm surprised you don't remember them, they made a big international impact, and they galvanized his ignorant base.

0,"The Economist, in a leader, felt it was important for the USA to indicate where its red lines with North Korea were drawn.  Trump's rope-a-dope technique is certainly different as you don't know what he's thinking, or even if he's thinking.  To me, that makes the situation scary because Jong Un may believe he can get away with more than he can get away with.  And the fact is, that if Jong Un shoots down a bomber, there's not much the USA can do without endangering South Korea and 300,000 of their own citizens.  Better to have tried to prevent that happening in the first place through diplomacy, which you can never assume won't work.

It's one of the good things that will come out of his win  I don't care for his personality but I'll take action over flip flopping on ideas like Hilary and Trudeau any day.  Trudeau can't decide on whether he supports the TPP although I'm sure he would if there wasn't so much public backlash.  This deal was formed behind closed doors and mostly without Canada's input so why the heck should we ratify it?  Trudeau should have said from the beginning that it wouldn't be ratified and we would look to doing our own deals with Japan. We already have deals with many of the countries that are part of the TPP so there were only downsides for Canada just so the US (I mean Obama) could impose their rules on us.  I just hope Trump sticks to his word and shoves the TPP in the garbage where it belongs and hopefully that will be the end of it.

0,"Somewhere around 1/3 of all that Canadians consume is imported, from refined hydrocarbons to food products to medicine to building materials  etc.  Almost all of it is priced in US$ at the transaction level. A weakening dollar represents an erosion in real income for all Canadians. A weak $CDN means Canadian manufacturing companies cannot import vital components and equipment to improve productivity in their processes. So, a low loonie simply disguises declining productivity leading to a crushing of competitiveness even while their export product attractiveness improves as the dollar falls. This is a road to nowhere.  As for oil prices, the $CDN value for better or worse is intimately linked to the price of oil, even though petroleum industry is only about 9% of GDP.   There is a strong correlation between oil price and $CDN.  The main reason the $CDN is not below $0.70 is from oil being above $50.00.  That and Trump being a nut makes the $CDN a hedge.

The working poor are slaves, while middle class, and uniformed half of the upper middle class have to pay the taxes for government. The wealthy lord over us with trickery and self interest. Health care, infrastructure, and education fail because the Ultra-wealthy don't pay their share, and take subsidies, tax breaks, no tariff's, gravy contracts, and natural resources handed to them for virtually nothing. Their corporate money buys our government. Corporations paying huge dividends, but no taxes ???   HMMMMM., It's a pseudo-fascist (corporatist, nationalist) paradigm.

The court said that laws forcing Native Americans off their lands were unconstitutional. Jackson is supposed to have said, """"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!"""" Whether or not Jackson did say that, it defines his attitude.  Jackson's support of the unconstitutional Indian Removal Act led directly to one of the most shameful episodes in US history, the Trail of Tears.

Put it together, vote on it, approve it, Trump signs the bill into law and this group is taken care of.  Pretty simple.  Going forward at a later date they need to agree on some kind of border security and comprehensive reform to include a path for anyone else who might deserve it (i.e. those with children who are citizens by birth), tighter border security and work place control going forward.  Without controlling who businesses hire it will fail.  A more transparent system of legal immigration and asylum would be good too.

Philosophically speaking I see the country on the road to same-think, to political correctness at the level of destroying cherished freedom.  Opponents to Trump do not strike me as issue driven at all.  They do not like the man who dares to be different, who will not conform to the PC mores they have come to expect.  In the endless, Trump bashing that goes on, I rarely hear about issues.  I hear over and over again about how """"unfit"""" he is for the Presidency not on the basis of issues but rather personality and style.  Trump's opponents are even willing to go to the point of alienating and antagonizing Russia the only country with the ability to literally destroy the US, in order to motivate their irrational hatred of what Trump represents, i.e. a successful man who does not share their worldview.

It basically says what Zieve said hear: the state never demonstrated and the company conceded to clear wrong-doing, but Electroimpact wanted to get out of the spotlight, and the state wasn't going to risk actually pressing the case and let them settle for a slap on the wrist.

He feels the need to immediately lash out and attack anyone questioning or seemingly slighting him. Carefully worded and measured responses are required from someone wanting to be the leader of the greatest and most powerful country in the world. Personally, I choose the Ice Lady over the Hothead for this job. Hillary is a study in control and discipline, so much so she is criticized. And while a polished politician, always applying spin, I find her more honest and trustworthy than most. Nearly all politicians sometimes stretch the truth. Trump seems to make a regular habit of it and often in a very clumsy way, Hillary only occasionally and much more artfully(check the nonpartisan fact checker sites). Self control to me is a more serious issue, something Trump is clearly lacking.

0,"I appreciate your careful response to what I wrote. Neither Trump's position on abortion nor Clinton's has much, if any, impact on abortion. Even the appointments to the Supreme Court would not make much difference. In the unlikely event that Roe is reversed, the issue simply moves to the states and abortions will continue or even accelerate. What does make a difference in the number and rate of abortions is access to quality, affordable health care; especially to pre-natal and post-natal care; as well as access to safe housing, adequate nutrition, and appropriate child care. Historically, the rate and number of abortions go up when Republican economic and social policies prevail; under Democratic administrations, the rate and number of abortions tend to go down, or to rise more slowly than under Republican policies. If Trump nominates 'pro-life' judges, doing so will not prevent one abortion. But if he repeals the Affordable Care Act, the number of abortions will go up. For sure.

Then there is the comment from the conservative which goes something like: If oil industry workers get laid off then all state workers should have their pay cut or loose their jobs altogether because I hate government employees and want them to suffer. Real classy those conservatives are.  If the conservative thinks government employment is so lucrative, he or she had ample opportunity to obtain one of those """"high paying, awesome benefits"""" jobs. The fact they never did is their problem. Instead the rag-a-colic conservative does the bidding of the 1%ers by attacking other middle class Americans and thus demonstrating they are too ignorant to know who they should be mad at. The result is Donald Trump.

Think about its repulsive legacy.      Large segments of the American electorate couldn’t handle the truth about Trump’s basement-low regard for women, and the policy implications thereof.      Large segments of the American electorate cared more about Clinton’s e-mails than they cared about Trump’s egregious misogyny..and because they didn’t care, the hand that Trump once used to grope women was the same hand he placed on the Bible to take the Oath of Office on January 20.

1,"I agree with your larger point but it's silly to blame """"academia"""" rather than larger cultural characteristics of American culture. Many of the articles I have read about the white lower middle class is they do not view themselves objectively from a class point of view so much as they feel an emotional affinity with their racial or gender group.  Frequently, they don't see themselves as poor even when they actually are. Rather they view themselves as temporarily """"down on their luck"""" and look up to the rich (Trump-like figures) as role models even though in reality they have almost no chance of emulating them, their lifestyles or wealth especially in the absence of an education. The white lower middle class men (especially) seem to view educated women (like Hillary Clinton or professional women) with disdain. Class isn't as cogent in America not because of elitism in academia (which of course exists) but rather because Americans eschew class comparisons and the very idea of equality.

Conversely, Mr Clapper’s misdeeds in Europe are fully on the record, in the Irish High Court and the European Court of Justice where one of his agencies, the National Security Agency, was “convicted” or found to have engaged in “mass indiscriminate surveillance” of European and UK users of the internet.  """"The accusations Mr Clapper and his cohorts are making against Russia are a mirror image of the unlawful activity he and his agencies were convicted of in Europe over the last two years.

0,"Obamacare needs to be repealed right now without delay. Trump promised to this this and that in part got him elected . Far too may people have their hands out wanting something for nothing . They want someone else to pay for what they want.  When they make a new plan covering those with existing conditions is the right thing to do. Allowing full grown adults to stay on mommies and daddy's plan until age 26 is beyond insane. Everything adds to the cost and keeping adults on the plan must be ended.  The big joke is democrats want young people who don't need medical care to pay for it or pay a fine to the IRS----at the same time wanting some young people to mooch off their parents plans paying nothing.  End Obamacare without delay. When liberals friends and supporters scream how bad it is---democratic legislators will work with republicans on a new health care plan. Obama mocked plans on medical tort reform saying 60 billion in savings was a drop in the bucket . That drop looks good now .

How about his speeches to businessmen 20 years ago?” “What if he said sorry every day for a year? Would that do it for you?”  What these judges ignore is the fact that, since his inauguration, Trump and administration officials have repeatedly and consistently bragged that his administration intends to keep ALL his campaign promises. When asked what his policies are, they have repeatedly said to look at his campaign speeches, """"It's all there.""""  In determining Trump's intent, the key fact is that he has repeatedly insisted, as POTUS, that all campaign promises remain his policy. Trump has not said that he was wrong during the campaign or that he disavows his stated intent to keep out Muslims.  Hopefully AG Chin will point out these facts to the court if Trump now asks them to ignore his campaign statements and promises.

0,"I am not in any way denying that Trump was elected as President.  There is NO QUESTION that Russia interfered in our election and that they were doing so on the side of Trump (unless you disagree with all 15 our various intelligence agencies, but they know more than you and I do...).  What remains to be seen is to what extent they succeeded.  Thus far there is no evidence that any actual votes were changed in devices (and I'm guessing that did not happen - but who knows).  But what IS known is that voter registration rosters were penetrated and that it is very possible that legitimate voters were purged before the election.  That would be a very serious crime, indeed and it wouldn't have taken much of that in the right places to have swung the election for Trump.  But I'll await evidence before claiming that Russian interference directly led to Trump's election. Nobody I know of is putting numbers to anything at this point but feel free to try to do so.

0,"Usurp is exactly the right word, Gary. When the Constitution gives specific authority over immigration to the Congress, and Congress writes specific laws delegating that authority to the President, and multiple presidents have exercised that very power without judicial interference until now, the Judicial branch is usurping that power by asserting their right of review and nullification of the President's action until such time as they slow-walk their way through that review. Mr. Trump's action was not overreach, but the court's action certainly was. This is likely to continue throughout Mr. Trump's presidency, as the Democrats have no power available to them except for this, and they don't like it. So when the duly elected President and Congress are thwarted by the Judiciary which is supposed to uphold existing law, not question it with out end, """"usurp"""" is exactly the right word. Think more clearly about the Constitutional role of each branch, rather than about a specific outcome.

The Electoral College is much hated by the left because it will not allow the 2 most populous coasts to dictate how the center of the country must be governed. Trump ran the table on the states that Hillary assumed were in the pockets of her pant suit.  The Blue Wall was cracked by Trump in 2016 and because he is keeping his word to those much maligned and abused former middle class people; he may tear down your blue wall next time.  You are paying attention to the wrong wall.

(This is assuming Janet comes thru on her promise.)  I've recently had the perverse privilege of seeing my income drop by 65% over five years. It was an industry blackout. We're on the upswing again but the experience taught me a lot about wealth and luxury. I don't see too many religious people signing on to austerity. I do see young people deeply involved in ecology eschewing cars and large homes. It will be interesting to evaluate Trump's cabinet of billionaires down the road.

0,"Interesting that David Shribman would latch onto the the catchy quote of Lord Durham regarding French-English relationships in Lower Canada for his analogy, but ignore the real reason for the commissioning of Report on the Affairs of British North America - the 1837 rebellions in both Lower and Upper Canada.  The rebellions were, of course, populist uprisings against elite rule. Upper Canada ruled by the Family Compact, Lower Canada ruled by the Chateau Clique. Essentially, farmers and small businessmen were trying, by force of arms, to 'drain the swamp'.  And the erratic behaviour of Donald Trump really isn't all that far from the fiery temper of the man in a red wing who was well known for outrageous commentary via the media of the day,  William Lyon Mackenzie.  But perhaps the outcome of present  U.S. chaos and confusion will be the modern equivalent emergence of calm, reflective men like Robert Baldwin to bring true reform to a broken political system and unfair society.

Fortunately however, Trump only sees the masses as a backdrop for his speaking events.

As a result Trump's followers will never be organized into Brownshirts, Tea Partiers or even Keystone Kops. They will remain the surly locals sitting on the porches in Deliverance.  Menacing. mindless and maniacal, they will be the backdrop of an ongoing dystopian drama directed by Tweets before dawn. .

The constant pandering to a liberal audience, the contradictory news opposing anything conservative, and the 'news' masquerading as legitimate articles when in truth they are editorials.  If the press wants respect then they should act with respect and not vultures waiting to insight controversy.  The country is sick and tired of twisted interpretations of actions by even the most innocent of people.  One most recent example is two women whom started a business, became successful, and were admonished by a black journalist for being white and serving Hispanic food.  They subsequently closed the doors of the business.  Social Justice?  No.  Bias journalism heavily peppered with racism.

It is disingenuous to pull out one of two incidents when The Religion Of Peace™ commits multiple atrocities daily. I note that one of the latest ones, the bombing in Lahore, barely rates a mention in the press. Presumably because a) it's either so commonplace it isn't considered newsworthy or b) it doesn't fit with the liberal narrative. 13 dead, 60 wounded, ho hum, just another day.  The sheer scale of the horrific acts committed in the name of Allah makes a mockery of attempts to compare to any other religion or movement. Here's just 2017, so far.  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=2017  Notwithstanding that, the post-election violence referred to by sheeperst is that perpetrated by the anti-Trump demonstrators, which has been demonstrably proven.

0,"Apparently your learning of geography did not include looking at voting results.  Go look at that map of the recent US election: All the big cities in Ohio, including Cincinnati, rejected Trump en masse.  He got the rural and small town vote in Ohio. You know, kind of like Harper got the rural and small town vote in many places in Canada?  And so I repeat my question: Why the hate against Cincinnati? The creation museum has nothing to do with Cincinnati. You might as well post on and on about how GM Center in Detroit and the Detroit Art Museum are integral and defining parts of Windsor Ontario.  Seriously, did somebody in Cincinnati run over your cat or something?

0,"Our system is confused & corrupted, but an even greater disabling factor is the lack of attention paid to the whole mess by the voters.  I can no longer advocate voting for Trump, but we must vote for our country. Hilary promises more BO policies, including ObamaCare, open borders, globalist trade agreements which result in fewer jobs & worse economy for the USA. She advocates more unvetted muslim immigrants, tolerance of Iran's nuclear & terrorist ambitions & actions, acceptance of impropriety & illegal actions by herself & other government officials.  She wants a larger, more oppressive government. Every election is critical to the future of our country ... but this one is the most important to date. I hope that the debate will turn to policies & steer away from personalities. A vote for anyone but Trump will accelerate the plunge of our country into the deepening liberal dystopia in which we already find ourselves.

0,"CMD:  The details of this case are readily available.  The Court's findings are readily available.  The Bakery was found to have discriminated in violation of Statutes regarding protected class status and refusal of accomodations/services.  The case will likely go clear to the Supreme Court regarding the Bakers' contention that their First Amendment Rights include the right to refuse service to a gay couple, based on their religious beliefs trumping the anti-discrimination law.  I have absolutely no knowledge of what kind of Christian your Grandmother was.  However, I do criticize Christians who use their religion as a tool to justify discriminating against LGBT individuals.  I feel we should allow others to live their own lives w/o our interference so long as they aren't hurting anyone else.  IMO, individuals in consensual gay relationships are hurting no one.  Indeed, I will continue to criticize discrimination against such couples.  I make no apologies for that.  Gary Crum

There was no evidence of collusion with Russia; even many liberal commentators (though not in NYT or on CNN) agree.   Comey admitted leaking information to a friend, prompting me to wonder how many other friends he leaked to.  While Comey serves as at the pleasure of the president and can be fired for cause or no cause, he works for the American people.  As head of FBI, he is supposed to be the top law enforcement officer, yet he admitted he had no courage when speaking to the president.  If he can't speak truth to power, I am led to think he just wants to keep his job.  Now fired, I am led to think he's looking to keep certain information secret to reveal in his multimillion-dollar-advance book.  I could go on.

(ii) We should not confuse title with power or responsibility, I suspect he believes ha can have much more power than the position itself suggests (and by keeping himself close to the Trump family he may be right).

And what we’re seeing  now is that he has formed an administration in his own image: cruel, ignorant, dishonest and dangerous.  The Apprentice President to be sure.

Out there in Alberta, Trumpites (that's what they are) are organizing to spoil Canada forever. Their agenda includes splitting up Canada if Canada doesn't get ruled again by petroleum companies. Back in Quebec, the Parti quebecois just announced a propaganda campaign to specifically attack the 150th anniversary of Canada. No Globe, you have no right to promote complacency.

Does anyone doubt that thousands of lives would be lost in a politically motivated war? There is nothing morally or legally inappropriate or improper about the prospect of using impeachment as a means to remove an objectively wayward President from office before that objectively wayward President takes an action that ends mass numbers of lives. Impeachment and removal from office is the only way to stop this nightmare from becoming reality. It’s the only way to contain the spread of this virus.

While Trump makes me more than a little uneasy, I can't quite bring myself to call him a fascist  He is a little too cozy with big business, overly obsessed with the cult of personality, and anxious to find scapegoats.......but his transgressions thus far have been quite trivial when compared with Hitler, Mussolini, or Franco.  I find that writers like Kendzior do their own causes célèbres more harm than good due to hyperbole.  Detractors become more polarized, and centrists are unlikely to be won over by purple prose and exaggeration.  Because I would like nothing better than to see the so-called alt-right go down, I wish she and her ilk would tone down the hysterics, and, if this isn't possible, confine their writing to avowed political organs rather than national newspapers.

The FISA Court said the illegal searches were “widespread” and “created a serious Fourth Amendment issue.” What this says is basically, Obama authorized the spying on American citizens. I would guess many are in the Trump campaign or administration not to mention Bernie Sanders as well. The weenies concerned about Russian interference with our elections should be outraged. We are doing to ourselves what the Russians, in their wildest dreams, couldn’t do. They must be laughing their a$$es off.

Should someone be consequently told, as well as others they mislead, that person is telling a lie? Censorship also comes from the public. What about Griffn holing a de-cap'd head of President Trump? Think she should had been able to go on without some Civil Enterprise of public discourse to pull her off the air?  But in truth, censorship can be used for good, or for ill. If Censorship is used in correction and admonition, then it is a good thing, if in fact it is for a moral and common good. Something that does not threaten liberty nor life. Socialists tried to Censor the Pope through each Major War. Modern Progressives try to Censor parts of what Pope's have said, or say today. Humane Vitae as an example. In fact, Socialists as in Germany, the USSR, and the Occult Imperialists of Japan in WWII, did Censor with Death.

0,"I totally agree. However should Catholic bishops, because they are against abortion and contraception, favor the Rebublican candidate because of this one issue. The Republican Party is Pro-Life, but work very hard to cut back on programs that help poor people. In my mind, Trump would not have been elected without the Catholic vote and the evangelical Christian vote. I believe in a more progressive tax system. The top 1% make much, much, more than the average worker. I'm pretty sure that a lot of Republicans vote Pro-life but are supporting programs that hurt the poor. I think it's a grave sin that in a country as rich as ours, children are going hungry. I think that abortion should be legal. I also believe that contraception should be readily available so that abortions are not necessary. During the time of St. Augustine, the baby wasn't considered a person until ensoulment (when the mother could feel life. I think that late term apportions should be for very serious reasons.

It isn't only Trump's demeanor towards and contempt for women, but his infatuation with foreign dictators and their methods, which should send us running away from him.  V.

It's unfortunate Mr. Trump wasn't confronted about his crude, crass misogynistic  behavior decades ago.....apparently, he wasn't and now, at 70 years old, he's still emotionally an adolescent.  He's actually rather pathetic.  Like many other wealthy and powerful individuals (frequently politicians,entertainers and atheletes) he feels he's so far above the rest of us that he can do """"what he pleases.""""

On the one hand, the massive demographic disruption that China experienced - resulting in a doubling of the urban population over the last generation to more than 500 million at present - has not been a free ride.  It has represented a mixed blessing that boosted hundreds of millions out of desperate poverty and created serious social and economic problems, one of which is the air pollution problem that Yakabuski cites.  I suspect that Yakabuski's sneering at the Chinese for responding to """"public outrage over air pollution"""" instead of having true """"climate consciousness"""" has a common source with Yakabuski's sneering at the Ontario Liberal government for it's 'bankrupt' policies favouring natural gas and renewable sources (Yakabuski, Jan. 12).

Jane Fonda has always been a first class politically conscious person and the tired 'GOM' responses on this thread show how pathetic 'Alburntah' has truly become, for any meaningful dialogue.

0,"No surprise coming from these two Obama clones, Gabbard and Schalz in their criticism of President Donald Trump quick action on the Syrian military base that launch that nerve chemical gas against his own people.  Was it last year or two, former President Barack Hussein Obama  wanted to strike the same Syrian military base, but first ask Congress for persmission.  Congress never took up the matter because of opposition by Obama's own political party. Well now, President Donald Trump is more action than cheap talk. Remember when Obama warned the Assad regime that if they cross that """"red line"""" they will receive some consequences. Syria's Assad cross that red line, and Obama retreated. . .

The bigger debate should be what types of medical services should be provided in an enlisted's health care package.  As far as transgender people serving, these are patriots risking their lives for our country and deserve the same respect as any other service member.

1,"Donald Trump set out to deliberately con the emotionally crippled, the intellectually challenged and the economically disenfranchised into giving him a job for which his own twisted psyche and intellectual paucity render him unfit. The last time the American electorate suckered to such a man we got George W. Bush and the Bush League Administration which prompted Osama bin Laden to spin around 3 times and click his heels with glee before launching his terrorist attacks on U. S. soil knowing that he'd get the self-destructive reaction which mired us in two unwinnable wars and driving us to shred constitutional freedoms and national ideals in a vain pursuit of safety. A hypocrite betrays ideals for whatever reason.  Trump has no ideals to betray.  He is a con artist, a criminal deserving the prosecution and punishment appropriate for the crime of defrauding the American people.

That's what white privilege looks like; you simply don't have to think about your racial identity, because being white seems normal and natural, as do the social, economic and cultural advantages that accrue to whiteness.  When civil rights movement, and Black Lives Matter manage to make an impression on these folks--which is more and more frequently--they begin to realize that white privilege is NOT, in fact, invulnerable, natural, or normal at all. Trump spoke to this discomfort, although he addressed it in the language of nationalism and economics not race.  The important thing to note is that the white nationalists in Charlottesville are addressing this discomfort too, and in fact couldn't exist unless they were.  This is Trump's conundrum. This is the reason for his hideous equivocation.

0,"We are not at a stalemate in Afghanistan now that Trump has taken over, ISIS is now being crushed but you don't hear that with our media. We had the war well in hand when the democrats in congress put politics before country (or the lives of our soldiers) and started their subversion of the war. We have no problems winning wars when not undermined by traitors. When the communists saw how easily they could subvert our efforts in Vietnam by creating chaos from within our populace they continued. Althou the USSR is gone those  provocateurs are still very active as they now represent the democratic party. Read the Verona papers if you don't believe me
"
0,"Smaller U.S. states get a slightly disproportionately high representation in the House of Representatives and vastly higher representation by pop in the Senate since each state has an equal number of Senators, so it doesn't seem to me that using a straight percentage of popular vote for President would grant control of the entire country to a few large states.  In any case, Trump will be officially elected as President today, as is correct based on the system people voted under in November.  That system should absolutely not be changed retroactively, though perhaps it is worth a discussion for future elections.

He's in bed with our arch-enemy Russia and he needs to pay for his treason. #LockHimUp!

0,"The SPLC  is not a credible source and such claims of increased numbers of hate groups, as a result of Trumps election and rhetoric can not be proven. Actually, there is a direct correlation between the Obama presidency and the deterioration of race relations in America. Hate for whites increased among immigrants and other groups.  As far civility and reasoned debate are concerned the Liberal dominated media and liberal politicians and their """"field"""" representatives are the ones responsible for the degradation of political, expression, or expression itself, in America. Did you see the women's march after Trump's election. The same goes for the overall decline in civility. Trump has had nothing to do with these matters. In fact compared to the media demons and the hate filled politicians he has been dealing with, Trump has been the perfect gentlemen.
"
0,"Not sure I can agree with the not rational part. This is the sharp end of America First- and only America: crush the opposition by whatever means to maintain absolute dominance in the market and expectations of fair play are naive with this bunch. That is how bullies operate and anyone who thought the new administration would allow anything else was dreaming. Somehow it seems they figure they do not need us or any of their other friends, and since you can't tell these guys anything, they are probably going to have to learn otherwise the hard way. That of course assumes we have the guts to look for and focus on others for whom fairness trumps instilling subservient obedience. Given the extent, and probably dominance, of American money in so much of our economy, that is a daunting leap, but we do as a Nation have the policy tools to reverse that dominance over time. It will no doubt be painful for us as well but sometimes you just gotta do what has to be done.

In that light, you rose above the """"don't go away mad, just go away"""" level, and I understand that your invite was reasonable.  As to your persistent quibbling, what Comey said was that he saw no reason to prosecute, that is, file charges based on probable cause. He repeated that belatedly after the Weiner eruption, but conveniently after the obvious damage was done. He influenced the election with innuendo, and he did it deliberately. You claim innuendo as evidence, but it is not. You have presented no proof of Clinton wrongdoing, while insisting that innuendo is proof.  You have advanced no argument pro, nor have you advanced your understanding re facts vs. rumor.  If you haven't seen the light by now, I hold out little hope that you will. However, I admire your sincerity, your honesty (within its limits), and writing skill.

Reasonable people can also disagree with the statutes remaining there and they can lawfully act to have them removed. See N.O.  What Trump objected to additionally and what does not bother you is the unlawful actions of leftists and the unfair coverage in the MSM.  What will probably bring the Republicans down is their utter inability to pass healthcare and tax reform.

Add to that the collapse of Trump Russian deals now under investigation by the FBI which is exposing how much contact Trump and his family had with corrupt Russian Oligarch's and mobsters tied to Putin. Felix Sater, a former employee and partner of Trump, and a convicted felon with connections to the Russian mob is a witness in these cases. Forbes, Fox, and the WSJ cover these corruption stories.

Your hope that a person's reaction to their fears or validations will not directly affect you will not play out that way all of the time, just because you believe that you are protected. I will never advocate violence. Yet, even the most experienced arsonists get burned eventually.  Do the job as it was intended, not how Trump wants to shape it.

Trump is really interested in balancing, or perhaps, reversing the trade imbalance.   The beneficiaries of the historical imbalance has not only been the Chinese, but also American and American-controlled multinational corporations and American consumers.    If China actually started respecting and enforcing international patents and copyrights it may help stem the tide, otherwise, import duties and other punitive measures will hurt all aforementioned, not only the Chinese.

Trudeau says anyone concerned about the escalating border crossings by illegals crossing the US border to Canada illegally to illegally game the system here as phony refugees for years (11 years is not uncommon which contrasts with the government's goal of 72 hours), posing a criminal and security threat inasmuch as a high % (up to 50%) already have serious criminal convictions, costing us as taxpayers tens if not hundreds of millions of unnecessary tax dollars and making Canada a world laughing stock is a vicious, nasty, deplorable fringe element racist.

1,"As reported by CNN, the New York Police Department’s Counterterrorism chief has evidence that the many threatening phone calls to Jewish community centers originate from a single individual located overseas.  One extra-territorial person using spoofing technology does not a rise in U.S. anti-Jewish sentiment make. OTOH, NYPD’s evidence is not inconsistent with the thesis that this rash of threat calls is foreign, state-sponsored terrorism. Stahl, Sr., asks “Which state?” and suggests Israel has the means, motive, and opportunity.  The community center threats have been reported since late January, after Trump’s inauguration. I can’t think of a more existential threat to Israel than an isolationist, nationalist, America-First President who wants to cut foreign aid. Sprinkle in some spicy speculation that Trump is a Russian tool, and Israel may think it faces the perfect political shit storm. Drastic times would require drastic, but hardly unprecedented for the Mossad, measures.

However, he could possibly win because Canadians are every bit as angry about political elites who haven't a clue what to do now that the economy is barely turning over. So, like Trump, there's the possibility of a sizable 'spite' vote ie. """"voting for anyone but the establishment"""". All political parties need to tune-in to the timbre of the times: if you don't come up with some real solutions quickly, you'll be 'one and done'. Trudeau is wandering around the country as we speak because he is starting to hear the rumblings of discontent that could see him become a once promising one-termer who assumed he had lots of time and no need to produce, when in reality most have become very impatient.

In that alternative universe Assad would have been emboldened to use chemical weapons again, knowing that no one in the world would stop him.  The Russians would have seen the Trump administration as weak and ineffective, just like the previous administration.  And after the opposition had eventually been defeated the world would navel gaze and wonder why a repeat of Rwanda occurred.  Accidentally killing a few Russian military isn't all that important to the Russians.  What did they do when Turkey shot down their pilot?   What would they do if the USA shot a few up on the ground?

0,"As a highly intelligent economist focused on keeping Canada a competitive and prosperous country, Stephen Harper always made it clear that Canada on this file would follow America's lead in terms of climate change policies and revenue schemes such as carbon taxes.  To do otherwise would put Canadian businesses at a serious disadvantage in export business to the US as well as encouraging Canadian businesses to move and/or set up expansion operations south of the border.  Regretfully, our sunshine, lollipops and rainbows PM born into silk and with the drama training somehow believes that he can impress foreign leaders and influence foreign governments to follow Canada's lead in terms of oppressive carbon taxes on their businesses and federal expressing billions of dollars to the UN to be turned over to the tender mercies of Third World Dictators supposedly to fight climate change but mainly to line their already deep pockets.

Of course, Trump’s embrace of Treason in Defense of Slavery memorials is perhaps the most important in terms of domestic politics.  That Trump can’t help but contradict himself constantly is amusing in terms of black humor.  Trump approved of the mass murder of Muslims thanks to a falsified story of religious and racist terrorism by occupying U.S. troops crushing an independence movement.  I mean, if this is what Trump supports, he might as well just cite the genocidal campaigns against Native Americans.  It’s not like he wouldn’t approve of Wounded Knee.

However, I believe those same folks would be disheartened if Pres. Trump changed his demeanor and became just another Washington pol.

When people voted for Trump they voted for a McCarthyistic view of the world and a man who blatently empliys the tactics Roy Cohn used during the McCarthy era.  All  while blatently displaying his racism, bigotry, misogyny, sexism, and a whole host of despicable human traits, then lying about it.

0,"Be careful what you read in the liberal media. There are lots of lies about Trump being spread from people that don't understand the world by which he comes. No other candidate has ever had a business background like Trump. When someone is in business and has hundreds and thousands of legal businesses, especially those in real estate development, bankruptcy is part of doing business. In the condo development arena, litigation attorneys run rampant at defect litigation. There are few laws that prevent them from filing lawsuits and freezing money for 5+ years. Sometimes, they win, which causes the legal company to go bankrupt. This is the business of RE development.  What you have to understand is every business venture is a new company and just because he made 4 bad investments doesn't mean he is a business failure. It means he made a bad investment. Just like the lawsuit claims they made. Almost every condo development gets sued. That is the cost of doing business in that industry.

0,"Mr. Broaderick:  I think you and I have both worked with sociopaths in our professional lives. The behaviors of Mr. Trump you note  are among the those behaviors which would lead to a clinical diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder.   Here's a definition from WikiHow:    """"A sociopath can be defined as a person who has Antisocial Personality Disorder. This disorder is characterized by a disregard for the feelings of others, a lack of remorse or shame, manipulative behavior, unchecked egocentricity, and the ability to lie in order to achieve one's goals. """"   In my layperson's opinion, it's likely a clinical assessment would diagnose Mr. Trump as a sociopath.....    If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck..........

The composition of the Supreme Court - whether it is one Justice or one hundred Justices - is Congress' decision.  There is no legal requirement that the Senate consider a nominee within a particular period of time, or holding hearings at all.  In 1824 John Quincy Adams was elected but Andrew Jackson won the popular vote AND the electoral vote.  In 1876 Rutherford B. Hayes won by one electoral vote but lost the popular vote by more than 250,000.  In 1888 Benjamin Harrison won but lost the popular vote by more than 90,000 votes.  In 2000 George W. Bush didn’t win the popular vote.  The election was a couple of months ago and it's time to put on our big girl and boy pants and get over it.

The most important thing about this election to me is the number of people who weren't taken in by Trump's act but voted for him anyway. They know he's a moral train wreck and a complete BS artist, but so strong is their level of dissatisfaction with politics as usual that they preferred to roll the dice with Trump rather than go with the more competent Clinton.  We may not like what these people are telling us, but we need to pay attention to it.

0,"IRV/rank choice voting doesn't fix the problems. What we need is Score Voting (https://electology.org/score-voting). Consider:  Rank choice FAILS to eliminate the spoiler effect, it just moves it. Consider that IRV claims it to be okay for Bernie to run as Green (as he was offered by Jill Stein) without spoiler. Well, let's say 45% top choice Trump, 35% top choice Bernie, 20% top choice Hillary. Hillary gets eliminated, because her voters are centrists, her 20% is split 6% 2nd choice Trump, 14% 2nd choice Bernie. Boom, Trump wins even if all the Bernie voters had Hillary as their 2nd choice. The claim that it was safe for all the Bernie voters to vote for Bernie because they would get their votes moved to their 2nd choice otherwise is a LIE. You only get your votes moved to your 2nd choice in IRV if you do not come in 2nd place overall. If your candidate comes in 2nd, your votes are worthless.

0,"Yes, there were grounds to fire Comey - he should have been fired on January 21st the day after Trump took office.  But timing MATTERS. Trump didn't fire him when he saw him as an ally and an enemy of Clinton. Trump fired him just one day after Comey requested additional resources for the Russia investigation. You must be utterly blind to think that was NOT why he did it.  Timing matters. When you do something is much more valid in discerning why you did it than whatever you have to SAY about why you did it.  Oh and that 'further erosion of trust in the media' is really not a risk. Media trust is the highest it's been in years. The one good thing that Trump actually did - was to make people choose real jouirnalism over facebook again. Since his election every major newspaper from the NYT to the Guardian have reported massive spikes in subscriptions - they're selling better than they were in the 1990s before internet news !

The disgrace to the office of president was Bill Clinton. He is who trailblazed for Trump. Everyone gave Clinton honors and awards, so why wouldn't they vote for a Trump ? Clinton was and is a vile perpetrator of sexual harassment and sexual assault on numerous women. Hillary made sure that the victim's of Bill were drug through the mud and called them trailer park trash and looney toons. So, in the long run, the Democrats are going to have a tough time coming up with anyone except Bernie ! Run Joe Biden and see not only the way he vilified Anita Hill but the way he treated a black man. Not so good. Maybe the Democrats will run Governor Moonbeam ! How about Vicente Fox ? Better be Bernie !

0,"Although it will be vehemently denied, hysteria, emotionalism, exaggeration and violence are not unusual traits for liberals and Democrats. I find it hard to imagine a God fearing Mennonite, a conservative judge, a tea party member or senior citizen (who actually received a good education a long time ago) rioting in the streets, looting, weeping, promising vengeance and adding insulting,horrendously evil thoughts and intents to mere words that were spoken,wisely or unwisely. You can't even talk politics with most liberals. Like a brick wall, they don't listen. They might insult you or worse, and they're seldom able think ahead to the consequences of their beloved liberal policies or any flaws in their chosen candidates. Their vocabulary is limited to """"racist, homophobic, greedy wealthy capitalists,"""" etc. Consequently, many Trump supporters refused to tell them or pollsters their choice. Since more Democrats than Republicans were polled, deliberately, the polls failed. Truth failed.

Now 45 is trying to engineer a tax cut for himself, his family, and his businesses, while bankrupting the Country.  So when we finally DO hear from our elected representative, it is to defend Trumps reprehensible behavior and claim both that congress is too busy to be bothered with 45's duplicity and tax avoidance strategies, as well as concerns about the POTUS' right to privacy.  Dave Reichert continues to be a mouthpiece and a water carrier for the big money behind the GOP, proving time after time he serves at the pleasure of donors and not working Americans.  The fact he is far more concerned about enabling the GOP to plunder the US treasury and pander to the .01% while destroying the economy, the environment, and any shred of decency or ethical behavior that may have survived the last election.

The article forgot to mention that corporate rates would fall to 20% while small business to 25% (I as a small business owner was  burdened by taxes and paying both sides of social security - which does not go away). Corporations now sit on  cash and are not creating jobs or increasing wages.  What happened to the Republicans howling about the deficit and the debt?  Do they even know the difference?  Regardless - this budget would INCREASE the budget deficit by a minimum  of $2.2 trillion and perhaps up to $5.8 trillion and all to give even more money to the rich and allow Ivanka and the tRump goons to inherit their dad's money and estate tax free!  Doubling the deduction for us little people who are not wildly rich means very little in terms of tax relief.  Personally I think government revenues need to be increased, therefore taxes need to be raised,   the rich and corporations should pay and the estate tax should stay.

The only meaning that makes sense is that he was trying to type  """"coverage"""", so the only question that makes sense is,  """"Why did he not succeed in writing that? Does he get drunk at night?

At first I thought it was juvenile, stupid and unpresidential. But it has its upside. At least we all know what's on his mind - as opposed to, say, Stephen Harper. In my view, the juveniles are greedy middle class liberals who don't want to spread the wealth around, don't want to upset the !%, are afraid of their corporate employer, and refuse to admit any responsibility for all America's ills. They need to repent and change their evil ways. They should don sack cloth and ashes and parade down main street flagellating themselves with birch tree twigs.

I know this, I've seen this, I know both parents and teachers who will reaffirm this.  Another way to devalue the admission is though 'legacy' or if not available, large donations.   A perfect example is President Trump.

I believe an examination of conscience is in order for those who could have been duped by  a con artist and someone who pandered to the worst in us-greed, egotism, self-righteousness and culpable ignorance.

0,"So the conversation between President-elect Trump and President Obama went something like this, """"I'll show you my birth certificate if you'll show me the receipt for that awesome head of hair"""" and """"I'll release my tax returns if you'll identify your true religion"""".  I also hear one was challenged to a game of basketball and the other was challenged to a game of Monopoly,  Side bets were fast and furious from the other elected officials standing around with their hands in our pockets.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.""""  The White Supremacists/White Nationalists are, IMO, the personification of evil.

0,"I think a 70% federal tax rate is way too high.  That encourages offshore money laundering. Mr. Trump does not know how to manage his money.  He has declared bankruptcy several times. You talk about pricing renters out of the market.  This is happening everywhere.  We live on an island that has a tourist economy.  We can't have it both ways.  We need to move away from tourism towards exporting more local crops and things like macadamia nuts, coffee, chocolate, etc.  When we encourage people to come enjoy paradise, don't be surprised when they want to live here.  The ones with a lot of money will continue to buy up houses for their second homes or buy just to rent them out because the rental market will continue to grow.

0,"Trump, in a letter to Comey dated Tuesday, contended that the director had told him """"three times"""" that he was not personally under investigation. McCabe said it is not standard FBI practice to tell someone he or she is or isn't under investigation. -- It seems like Trump had vivid dreams of the """"three times"""" incidences and after awakening, believed it had happened in real life.  It appears the White House lied. Like, this is not spin or misleading the public. Clearly Trump believes this nonsense and no one is willing to tell him otherwise or THEY all actually believe this alternative universe.  Come on. When are we invoking the 25th Amendment? This was a horrible, dreadful mistake and it's long past time to admit that he's a failure.

There are volume's of studies available for reference.  Trump prefer's tweets.  He can't handle complexity.  I'd be good for a change if this President would acknowledge that over 70% of American adults did not vote for him.  (That's fine, it would have been about the same for Clinton.)  He's a miserable Leader who panders only to his sycophant followers, not the general public concerns.

I simply want the option at the next election to check a box on the registration form to opt out of the release  of my information absent for a very restricted purpose and feel I am totally within my rights to demand that option.

Will those services be provided and, if so, who picks up the tab for those services?  2.  If large numbers of young and healthy people drop insurance, won't those who maintain insurance see their premiums increase?  3.  If everyone can deduct premiums for income tax purposes (not just those covered by employer sponsored plans), why should employers offer healthcare as an employee benefit?  4.

To add insult to injury, the corporation moved to Ireland to avoid paying income taxes on the windfall profits.

0,"I guess that depends on the definition of racism.  In Canada for example, it's morphed so much under a liberal regime, that being opposed to illegal immigration means you're a racist.  Being opposed to some of the more radical tenants of Islam, means you're a racist.  Believing in free speech as a sacrosanct charter right, means you're a racist. Opposed to M-103, you guessed it, you're a racist.  Being conservative?  Well, Jeff Foxworthy is writing a new comedy bit as we speak.  Believing that Catherine McKenna is terrible at her job, well of course that means you're a misogynist.  Oops, sorry, that's a topic for another article.  Trump, much like the police, have inherent biases and prejudices many of which are towards race.   But racist is a term that should not be used lightly to try and shame opposing political points of view like we are currently experiencing in Canada.

There is no hidden agenda. that is so easy to deal with because it is what it is.  Personally i think he may have a slight case of Turrets syndrome that is un diagnosed.

0,"Trump can not stop the clean energy momentum. For example, no company in their right minds will touch coal. Car companies are moving as fast as they can away from gas powered automobiles. Oil companies are diverting capital to clean energy sources. Big investors like Buffet are buying into energy storage companies.  Check out Tony Seba's Clean Disruption or Bill Gates alternative forms of energy e.g. 4th gen reactors. Trump's ideology is irrelevant. The Paris Accord is irrelevant. You can't stop progress. Have you tried to buy a light bulb lately? They were replaced by LEDs in just a few years. Maybe people should learn about what's really going on in the world instead of blowing smoke.

0,"Pointing out what is unacceptable behavior to my kids as they grew up they learned what is and is not socially acceptable behavior. And they learned to stand up for against bullies and defend themselves from unwanted sexual advances. That the American people(the 25% who voted for trump anyway) are okay with the vileness of trump is beyond comprehension for them and hundreds of millions of other Americans who were raised with the same standards of decency. Calling reprehensible behavior just that is what I would expect from my fellow Americans before this election happened. We are in very strange and dangerous territory now that sexual assault is overlooked for the sake of electing the man representing the tribe you obviously belong to. My daughters were shocked to tears by the incomprehensible ability of Americans to overlook trumps words and deeds towards not just women but virtually every minority demographic in America.

0,"Sorry, I probably have no business on this thread of comments but I did want to point out one thing: your absolute lack of logic. Nowhere did icon666 state that dealing with 20,000 refugees would be bad. The comment stated dealing with 20,000 refugees would be BETTER than 20,000 Trump followers. Nowhere in that thought is an implication that dealing with refugees is bad, and if you see it as such that exposes how narrow-minded your stance truly is.  And speaking of intolerance, what icon666 is not is intolerant. They simply want, as most liberals do, the world to be an inclusive place BECAUSE WE ARE ALL ONE SPECIES. Only bigots and those who don't want to forward humanity as a whole want to close-off from the rest of the world. Inclusion of others is all about evolution and progress. Humanity has not -- and will never -- settle just to be comfortable. We consistently adapt and evolve, something Trump supporters don't want to do.

Ivanka is successful because her products are made by what is essentially slave labor.  Trump abandoned two wives and his children to satisfy his desire for serial adultery with strangers.

If a country, ANY country, cannot properly vet those that wish to enter said country, than those that wish entry should not be given entry, especially within the current times.  My own feeling has always been thus.  Streamline, and make legal immigration more efficient, and make illegal immigration nigh impossible, both with secured borders, and the arrest and incarceration of any individual or company that knowingly hires an illegal immigrant.  Once that is done, and cheap labour is no longer available unto those that choose near slave labour, jobs shall no longer be the draw to said illegal immigrants.  Of course, it would help should our bloody Government not offer support to those that are here illegally, also.

These same lobbyists wanted Canada to join the Iraq War in 2003, and they will be at it again. Former prime minister Brian Mulroney is already lauding Mr. Trump as a “very nice guy.” *** In our celebration of Canada's 150 year anniversary of nationhood, the government might want to take into account our 150 years of peaceful relations with the U.S.  A mutually beneficial and respectful relationship.

If you know of a provision in the Constitution that says otherwise, please share it with me and others.  Incidentally, the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, signed into law by President Nixon in 1974, established 55 MPH as the maximum speed limit, later changed to 65 MPH, and required sates to comply as a condition for receiving federal highway funds.  Nothing unconstitutional about it.   The national speed limit was repealed by Congress in 1995.

In testing, they have not been 100% accurate.  Worse, what if a THAAD is used and misses?  South Korea is already divided over the presence and installation of THAAD batteries in SK.  If one misses, then fear AND philosophical objections rise, and have major legs.  Two huge problems.  And, in my view, we're confronted with them because Trump stupidly went big body.

Both Presidents Jack Kennedy and Bill Clinton were known womanizers - both had long history of doing so  Kennedy had his lovers escorted into the White House late at night while Clinton had a young woman intern give him oral sex right in the Oval office  ONLY difference was that Kennedy and Clinton were Democrats while Trump is a Republican  At the core of the protest is that Trump won the 2016 election in KEY states and the Democrats could not get their vote out in the KEY states  Moore, Garry R - Solutions Inc

0,"Outsider:  """"personal style""""..........""""fine-tuned machine""""........""""out of control media""""........  """"elite liberals""""......... Please sir, the criticisms of Trump from across the political spectrum embody far more than trivial concerns with his """"personal style.""""  Surely, you realize the man is seriously out of his depth.  It was, I think, unfair to put him in office.  He lacks the knowledge, the understanding, the temperment and the emotional stability to execute the office of President of the United States.  In sum,  THE MAN IS A WALKING DISASTER.  I admire your loyalty.. However, sir, at some point you, KellyAnn and Sean need to all realize you're defending the indefensible.  Let's face it.  We're seeing the exact Trump we've seen over his entire lifetime......self-centered, bullying, angry, tempermental, vindictive, uncaring...rather unattractive traits in a friend or acquaintance, let alone a President.  Again, I admire your loyalty.  You remind me of Captain Edward Smith... regards

0,"http://www.politicususa.com/2016/07/30/mccain-advisor-clinton-economic-plans-create-10-million-jobs.html According to a report released Friday by Moody’s Analytics, Hillary Clinton’s economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections.  The analysis shows that, if implemented, the Democratic nominee’s agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent.  It found that Trump’s policies would substantially hurt the economy and lead to a downturn worse than the Great Recession. Unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million Americans would be put out of work.  Republicans, of course, are quick to question the legitimacy of any analysis that doesn’t comport with their pre-existing worldview. However, the lead author of these reports, Mark Zandi, was an economic adviser to John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign.

0,"Of course if the  Catholic Church's norms for other things (like abortion or contraception) apply to non-Catholics, logically the rules about marriage and divorce would apply as well.  Jesus was talking about all marriages when He said if you marry when divorced you are comitting adultery. Maybe Jewish ones, specifically, since that was who He was talking to.  Many argue that if Jesus said something, it is universal. Makes no difference whether  """"Trump is not a member of any church, sect, or denomination which has a problem with divorce and remarriage."""" The argument should be whether Jesus has a problem with it.  Same with treatment of foreigners and immigrants. May not be against Trump's 'Religion', but question is whether it is against the religion of Jesus -- and ours.

We see that in his personal insults and attacks on reporters who ask """"unwelcome"""" questions and we're now seeing it with his exclusion of those media outlets who have been most critical of his performance and have asked those most difficult questions.  We're seeing a blatant effort to control the media as no American President has attempted over my lifetime.

0,"The initial response by the American public to the Trump speech according to polls taken immediately after the speech was 75-80% favourable.  It was hopeful and thoughtful and put the people first and recommitted to keeping the promises that president Trump made during the election campaign.   Most people were clearly and righty impressed.  The CNN pundits appeared stunned as they gave grudging praise to Trump while trying to figure out a way to subtly discredit a fine speech, perhaps the most remarkable one ever given by a 70 year old with less than two years in politics.  Predictably, the overwhelmingly liberal, Democrat loving and Trump hating  bicoastal and Beltway elites mounted a swift counterattack within hours to let the people now how they """"should"""" think about and assess the speech. and the president.  His supercilious, condescending, damning with faint praise column indicates that Andrew Cohen is a loyal charter member of this increasingly out of touch group.  Disappointing,

Then they threw their puppet, the Shah, under the bus when he started to show some backbone via a secret deal with the Saudis to supply the US with oil and to insist that all future oil sales to end users to be paid in US dollars (cementing the hegemony of the currency and US financial power).  The ME is tribal. Has been for thousands of years. Strongman rule is in their culture.  Well, America made its bed through their inference in the region. It now has to lie in it. Doesn't matter what Trump will do, it will be a festering pus boil that will be permanent. They have made an enemy for life. These attacks will continue under a Trump administration no matter what draconian measures he brings in.  China will be waiting on the sidelines discreetly, strategically enabling enemies of the US to do their bidding with each Trump move against them.

She put an unknown number of American secrets out there for a high schooler with a laptop to hack and somehow she's more qualified because Trump """"insulted"""" a Muslim American?

1,"Complete arrogant nonsense. You are deliberately twisting my words. It is not black and white, but a matter of degree, and of evolution. Germany changed gradually from the late 20s to 1939. Hitler gradually turned Germany into a fascist country over more than 10 years. Chile, Argentina, Italy, some of the Balkan countries, all were fascist at different times, to different degrees. Various civil rights always existed, although often perverted.  As I have said repeatedly and for some reason you are determined to ignore, there are obvious parallels between Trump and fascist leaders, and the way Trump is changing the politics in the US, aided by the Repubs, is in a fascist direction. If you deny that you are either completely ignorant, or deliberately blind. But probably you are a Trumpist.

The Trump family will constitutionally use his position to enrich themselves, often by taking payment from foreign powers. His cabinet officials will do the same, although Ben Carson may choose to not participate. Taxes on the wealthy will fall. Programs that benefit ordinary Americans will be gutted (Social Security, Medicare, the ACA, environmental protection, labor law enforcement, subsidized housing, Planned Parenthood, Medicaid, and labor law enforcement).  Fun times ahead. I'll watch in wonder as so-called white working class folks have to contort in every direction to lay the blame on someone other than their racist leaders. Of course, we're likely to be given some wonderful distractions that will be blamed on some non-white """"other"""" to feed the hatred that uneducated white people are so full of.

0,"Like Frau Clinton?  I don't think so, Jack.  Trump is not racist. He is not dishonest and he sure as hell has more principals  than to throw all his supporters under a bus, like Frau Clinton does in her latest book.

In fact, I (caucasion) had a black doll in the 1950s. My parents encouraged me to play with the (few) black children in my school. They believed in equality.  I am not racist.  I do notice the color of skin and celebrate differences that can enrich us as a society.  I also think immigrants are good for this country and dilute the hate and entitlement from white people.  Immigrants start businesses too while white people who voted for tRump think America should save them.  You accuse Ozy of """"intolerance and hatred"""".  What I have noticed in you and your illegitimate President is that when someone throws out accusations - they are really the guilty ones.  tRump accuses the real media of fake news and lying when he is the perpetrator.  You accuse Ozy of hate and intolerance and racism when you are the one who appears to be that.

0,"Trump says """"X."""" Media says, """"That's false because you can't prove it!""""  The media is wrong, both logically and in the journalistic sense. Assuming he actually said the words anonymously attributed to him by a Democratic aide, Trump may be right. We don't know otherwise, because there's no evidence to confirm or refute his statement. Therefore, an honest journalist won't say that Trump's statement is false, she will say only that the statement can't be verified.  What the public seem blind to is that since journalism began, reporters have dutifully parroted the words of politicians and government officials, Only rarely does the media question or verify what's been said. Instead, they seize on an easy trope like, """"The Russians hacked the election!"""",  with little examination. Only now that so much of the media hates Trump have journalists remembered that they should doubt every word that comes from a politician's mouth. But you can see how little practice they've had.

In fact, it's used so loosely that it simply means anyone who disagrees with neoliberalism and globalization.  Since I think that neoliberal policies and globalization were really set up to benefit global finance, 'populism' means anything that disagrees that the interests of global finance are the interests of the majority.  It's a dismissive term that fails any analytical test: populism simply means political movements that put 'the people' at the centre of analysis.  I ask myself: would Roosevelt's New Deal be considered part of a populist movement by today's supposed political establishment?  Would any political organization or movement that tried to help 'the people' be considered populist?  If so, then I'm a populist, although my politics are very different than that of Trump.

0,"I think that Putin was in more of an anti-Hillary mode than a pro-Trump mode.  If you look at her hawkish positions in the Middle East going all the way back to Bill Clinton's cruise missile attacks and regarding several regime-change initiatives between then and now and then add in her backing President Obama on sending US troops and missiles to Poland, that seems more important to me than some oil guy's personal resume'.  Putin is trying to restore Russia to USSR status; which of the two, Clinton or Trump is more likely to be the most aggressive in deterring that concept?
"
0,"Disagree. I think the primary motivating force for most people who voted for Trump is they don't want the government to give them anything; they want to earn it. They don't want welfare. They want to sacrifice life and limb and health and comfort and leisure and earn their own way so they can be proud of what they have and be respected for having earned it.

0,"Politicizing the Supreme Court is never a good thing. But since we are all humans, it is impossible to say that every appointment is always a good one made. In my mind, Justice Thomas proves this over and over again. Polls are not good for ruling on laws but polls can be a good tool in proposing and/or advancing legislation. Polling can be manipulated easily. Here is one longer term poll regarding the ACA.  http://kff.org/interactive/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&aRange=twoYear  IMO, a single payer universal catastrophic coverage program should have been where congress began, instead of what we have now.

0,"Not true.  Presidential pardon authority is very broad, and can be issued before conviction or even before charges are filed (i.e. he could pardon Snowden if he wanted to).  The catch with the Clintons is I don't think a presidential pardon is blanket enough to be """"pass on everything someone did from date A to date B.""""  With the Clintons, Trump could hypothetically pardon them for everything we know or suspect they've done and another scandal would just bubble up to the surface to show some new way they broke or skirted the law.
"
0,"It's pretty simple really. Trump is targeting Al Qaeda, ISIS and Islamic extremism in general. The Saudis are in conflict with Al Qaeda and ISIS. Along with Qatar, it is also a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council which views Hezbollah, Al Qaeda and  ISIS as terrorist organizations. Ditto Pakistan and Indonesia. The US and the GCC's antagonism towards Iran is well known  I wouldn't be surprised if Trump likely has in mind a counter terrorism group that includes moderate Arab States, Pakistan, Israel, Russia and Turkey.

0,"Too often this is a life or death matter for gay teens.  Last I checked the suicide and homelessness rate for religious teens wasn't even close to the same numbers for as it for gay teens.  When that much pain is involved in an issue, compromise with the forces causing the pain is more akin to betrayal than anything else.  However, I doubt the LGBTQ community is going to isolate itself as a special case from other communities which will come under attack during the Trump administration.  There will be a coalescing of groups who join together to protect everyone's rights....even Islamic religious rights.  The gay community is in some respects uniquely positioned to provide leadership in this joint effort.  This is now a time to stick together, not necessarily stick out.

0,"Right. Disposable income increase is a rounding error so is the increase to personal savings. The fact is that the wages are stagnant and the personal debt levels are staggering.

0,"A faux scandal. The Liberals started to outraise the Conservatives. Heard a Conservative pundit suggest todsy that everyone except the Liberal PM and Ministers should be allowed to have fundraisers. Never heard that suggestion when Conservatives were in power. Call a fundraiser cash-for-access often enough and those not paying close attention assume a scandal exists. That's the thinking, I guess. Chris Alexander had a $3,000 a plate fundraiser in spring 2015. Recently there was a story about NDP raising $10,000 per for an event (per table? Per plate?) In the U.S. fundraising ticket prices for Trumps was $500,000. Kind of puts our pettiness in perspective Business people being being interviwed by reporters the last couple of days  said they were approached but turned down the Liberal invitations   because there is no opportunity at these events to gain any kind of traction or influence. It's just a meet and greet. So much for the argument that these are scandalous cash for access event.

0,"Agreed. But don't exaggerate the power and danger of the extremist right wing groups. They don't have a lot of support from the moderate right or ordinary Republicans, except in getting their votes to win elections. That in itself is egregious. But let's keep some perspective on reality - the harm these racist right wing groups do is minimal. On the other hand, racism is always worst in bad economic times. Governments use them to distract from growing income disparities as the rich corporations get richer. If Trump's millions of supporters are not accommodated with decent jobs, they could fall under the influence of these marginal racist groups. Meanwhile, however, these groups are mostly a lot of hot air being fueled by the media. The real hate problem in North America is hatred of the poor. Neo-liberal ideology and scapegoatism have pushed the poor deeper and deeper into impoverishment and homelessness, minimum wage workers subsist, millions are one cheque from homelessness.
