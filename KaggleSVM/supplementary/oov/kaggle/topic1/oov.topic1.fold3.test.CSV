1,"Ah Tim, is this the latest strategy to for Republican's to be competitive in Oregon?  Try and convince us with poor logic and  selective data that the party of Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Carson, etc. isn't really the bumbling fools they appear to be?  And how about the unfounded idealism that the pure free market is the best system, that low taxes are a panacea for all that ails, and that businesses are perfectly capable of regulating themselves without negative consequences.  While liberalism, like any large group, will have it's fair share of those that misbehave, your arguments are either disingenuous, or incompetent.  Take your pick.

0,"The Democrats had the presidency for 8 years. What did they do with it? Why do they deserve it again?  I'm no fan of Bernie Sanders, or socialism, but I'd have backed him to the hilt against Clinton. That Sanders is out is no reason to slavishly fall in line behind the unfolding criminal enterprise of Clinton.  The Republicans kept going under Obama. It's not like the Democrats won't keep going under Trump.

0,"It's difficult for a reasonable person to dispute with the Trumpy the Clown worshipers because Hillory the Blood Cuntess is even a worse nightmare than Trump.  She represents the interests of the Zionist entity, and ONLY its interests.  Anyone who thinks those are compatible is encouraged to read """"The Assault on the USS Liberty"""" by former Navy Lt. James Innes, who was duty officer on the day of the attack.  Or consider the Zionists' deliberate irradiation of 100,000 of its own JEWISH citizens because they weren't the right """"race"""", then tell me they'd hesitate to do the same to us given the opportunity.  Hillory will drag us into a nuclear war for the sake of her Zionist masters.  We don't have a viable choice--fascism is here.

0,"“I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”  Here's my assessment:  “I pledge allegiance”.  Must I pledge allegiance ALWAYS? Are there any circumstances that I shouldn't support the deeds of America?  Nationalism begets stupidity. Like in the Olympics, who cares if America is a winner? Am I as an American citizen beholden to the winner only, or can I respect the prowess of other teams?  “one Nation”. We are more divided now than ever in my lifetime, made visible and enflamed by the narcissism of Trump and the untrustworthiness of Clinton.  “under God”. Believing in a god diminishes reason and reason is the only basis for solid decision making.  “indivisible”. We aren’t.  “liberty and justice for all” is 100% against the evidence.  So why have this anachronism in our culture at all?

0,"This mean-spirited bill deserves to be unceremoniously vetoed.  It's based upon zero proof of Russian election interference, has nothing to do with saving Ukraine or Syria, and everything to do with destroying Trump's Presidency.

1,"Though I would never support Trump for president for many reasons, I am thankful that his actions have spurred this discussion. As a woman, I have to say I am surprised that men, good men, are oblivious to the ubiquitous  harassment faced by women. I, too, have felt compelled to tell my husband about two incidents in my past that I have been silent about; I guess I assumed that we as women just keep our heads down and get on with life in spite of what are really horrendous, yet everyday events. No, when I was groped almost daily on public transportation I never stopped the train to report it. Perhaps now I would act differently.  I know I have backup. This has nothing to do with politics.  I would never vote for Trump because he is a childish, proudly uninformed, waffling, dishonest, pathological narcissist. But I do welcome the outrage and ensuing discussion that he has triggered.

"
0,"I really can't find enough info in this article to be able to draw much from as far as how each candidate might actually behave once in office, as opposed to what they say on the campaign trail. Let's face it, they'll both take money from wherever it might come from for whatever reason it's given  (like Carpinito's doubling down). From what I can surmise, they're basically sides of the same coin and will do the bidding of developers, the police departments, banks, and business owners while going through the motions of supporting programs that actually impact the social problems that affect us all in the community. No one has offered up any imaginative ideas/details as part of their platforms or in their appearances - pretty vanilla candidates. Nothing central to their campaigns that you could get excited about. Neither one will make difference in the direction Kent has been going in (while they've been council reps). It's like picking Clinton vice Trump - really no choice at all.
"
0,"To those of us who appreciate Trump, CNN could still be obsessed and report on the positive and funny aspects of his presidency.  His off-the cuff plain talk is refreshing and oftentimes hilarious in a role that is traditionally handled with much formalism and carefully chosen words.  Instead, the reporting is conspiratorial, tabloid-like, as if they are teasing us with the promise of a  revelation that only they know that will bring down the Trump administration.  It's pretty biased in that respect, but it's primarily about ratings.

0,"When all is said and done, what will be remembered?  Trump becoming President or a lot of women and a few anarchists protesting with a message as clear as the Occupy movement?  Time to go home and deal with the reality of defeat.  It is also quite amusing that most of the media preys on Trump's inaccuracies when it is they who made the greatest inaccuracy in American political history- a Clinton victory.  Which inaccuracy will be remembered?  lol.

0,"In my opinion, perhaps one of the positive outcomes of Trump winning the election, is that Canada will finally grow up as an independent and sovereign nation and starting spending more money on defence....this is not a bad thing.  Sending 450 soldiers to Latvia or 600 troops on UN """"peacekeeping"""" does not cut it for a nation that wants to be taken seriously as a """"G7 nation.""""  Canada has not spent its """"fair share"""" on Western defence since Diefenbaker in the late 1950s, despite the political spin.  It's time to ante up and invest in increasing our defence self sufficiency rather than sponging off the US, regardless of who has been in power.  Obama in his last visit to Canada was also rightfully pushing for Canada to assume some adult responsibility for defence.

0,"[Partisan blah, blah, blah... it is a political process.] Baloney.  The next step is laid out in the Constitution.  You know what the next step is and refuse to answer the question.  It is the impeachment process.  You know full well what you push is a lie with your """"if they cannot overturn"""" line. You sir, with all due respect, are a worthless partisan liar.  You, like Trump, care nothing for the rule of law and put party above nation, truth, or anything else.  That much is clear by how you spent 90% of your response attacking your political target and five words responding (I wouldn't call that an answer) to the question.

0,"The NFL IS the players. These are athletes that are the best of the best. Ownership knows it's hard enough finding the talent necessary to fill out a team so they can't fire players without the quality of there product dropping dramatically, so yea it's all business for ownership.  The players on the other hand are doing this for a cause. They have a platform and it is great that they can use this platform to protest the systemic racism and injustice that still permeates our legal system and our culture. This is a conversation we must have and a cause that we all need to take up so that this country can live up to the ideals set forth in the constitution. The players should be commended not condemned. They are actual working to make our country great - for everyone. Trump, on the other hand, is divisive. His """"great country"""" is exclusive and exclusionary. There is a reason Trump rallies are 99.9% white.
"
0,"Can the Globe writers be any more intellectually dishonest? Why does everyone frame this as a """"Trump Muslim Ban""""? Trump expressed stopping immigration of people from Islamic countries until they could ensure that a system is in place to properly vet the influx of people. Why are people so quick to forget that Jimmy Carter also had a ban placed on Islamic countries...where were all the democrats shouting 'xenophobia' back then!?!.
"
0,"Everybody needs an ego boost sometimes.  The problem is that trump is so insecure, he needs his ego stroked constantly.  This is what we see when he meets with world leaders.  Unfortunately, the world leaders also see this and understand that trump can be taken advantage of if he does not listen to his advisors.

0,"Despite the largely military audience immediately standing to show the proper respect for the lowering of the flag, Commander in Briefs Trump did not stand and show respect for the flag or for the military tradition. He surrounds himself with actual military men, he boasts of 'doing the military so well your head will spin', but through his own actions and inactions, he disrespects the American flag and cherished military tradition while on base acting as Commander of the Armed Forces. Wait for the outrage. (…there won't be any, …there isn't a black target to point to here, ...just Trump, and he can murder America in the street and his followers won't care.)

0,"Urasis Dragon asks: """"I wonder what the CIA is trying so hard to keep from the public?"""" Sometimes revealing information unavoidably betrays the source of that information...or destroys the reputation of a group or informant or some individual who played an innocent role, not knowing at the time. There are, perhaps, still intelligence gathering lines, deeply covert, that provide insights into other governments' motives and directions.  It isn't so much that the American People need to be kept in the dark, It's information our adversaries don't need to know, or have access to.  Trump seems to be fishing for another diverting scandal.  They've recreated the """"Clinton/Obama/Russian """"uranium deal"""" scandal over the last couple of days.

0,"This is the first smart thing Trump has done. He's making Congress do their jobs and make a decision on this situation one way or another, the way it should be. This is a great opportunity to give the DACA folks some clarity on their situaion as well as implement stronger immigration policies that are long overdue. Win-Win.
"
0,"Trump is now considered a racist because he correctly chastised both groups as both groups were responsible for the violence.  I for one am tired of an """"apology"""" President.

I think Assad did it. But just interesting on fake news is generated-- my thought is that the Russians and Syria generated this false news. In this case it is being spread by Trump supporters who do not want us to intervene in Syria.

0,"The New York Times this evening reports that leaders of foreign allied nations have been trying to contact Trump without success, to discuss his plans. Trump is clueless as to how to proceed as the leader of the free world, which encompasses many nations who seek his guidance.  Trump is adrift. He is an ignorant man without any training in statecraft, and at this point, he has no competent guidance within his inner circle. This is a bad situation. rumors are adrift that, should Trump seriously founder, the electoral college might endorse Hillary Clinton, who has won the popular vote by an unassailable margin.  We may be facing a Constitutional crisis.

0,"It’s doubtful that playing the blithe morning ingenue is what Kelly “wants,” but it’s an established (albeit indirect) route to the anchor desk she may covet. My sense is that NBC didn’t want Kelly – she isn’t really, despite her anti-Trump musings, 'one of them.' What it wanted was to strip their ratings (& ideological) arch-rival (FOX) of its leading lady, and were willing to invest some years and millions in achieving this.  And now, after an agonizing dénouement, consisting of a series of ratings disappointments and scathing critical humiliations (already in progress), exacerbated by the network tragically miscasting Kelly, NBC can ‘sadly’ announce that its contractual relationship with her just hasn’t worked to their mutual benefit.

0,"You seem  unaware that today`s G 7  - the US,  Germany, Japan, the UK, France,  Italy and Canada  - is not claiming to be the  world`s seven largest economies.  Today`s G 7 is the group of countries sharing western liberal democratic values that are the most prosperous and populous and influential of such countries..  It used to be the G 8 including Russia but after Putin`s invasion and occupation of Crimea, our PM Harper took the lead to get Russia expelled from this group and to emphasize the common democratic values and interests that help unite the rest of the group.  One of so many Harper accomplishments of which most Canadians are utterly ignorant.  And somehow achieved without a single selfie!  Yes, by GDP we are probably 13th in the world.  With The Clown Prince at the helm, expect us to go even lower unless Trump saves Trudeau`s sorry a$$  by juicing the US economy which will then need to buy more from us.

0,"Megalomaniacs and tyrants don't budge. They don't have to. They don't have a moral compass to compel them, and nor do they have to acknowledge or respond to those beneath them.  And as far as Trump is concerned, despite all that talk about giving the government back to the people, the common person is far far beneath his gilded tower.
"
0,"Good points, Mr. Gerson.  Our country is beginning to look like gang warfare.  Pres. Trump's bluster and late-night tweeting style has reduced political discourse to playground name-calling, his 'alternate facts' and constant push for more power have too many feeling ignored and afraid.  They feel they've lost their voice when their protests are labeled as 'hate speech' or 'whining', when conservatives, like bullies, taunt 'we won, we'll do what we want' instead of paying attention to legitimate concerns.

If you read the comments section, you would have noted that I highlighted and outlined/linked to the CARA study over a week ago in response to some *trad* commenters who were quoting incorrect and out of date catholic voting patterns in 2016.

0,"Just googled up """"General Election Polls"""". First hit on page is Real Clear Politics which aggregates ten or so polls. They show Clinton beating Trump by 12% while Sanders beats Trump by around 16%. That is after Clinton has been vilified and attacked ruthlessly and relentlessly for thirty years while Bernie hasn't even had to face the right wing GOP smear machine yet.

0,"From what I have gathered, they say RT News constitutes interference in the US elections. Because RT seemed to favour Trump over Clinton. That's ridiculous. As if western media, such as BBC and CNN don't take sides when it comes to Russian elections. Also, as far as I know, the whole Panama Papers thing was an orchestrated attempt to undermine Putin's party before Russian elections.  There are many things wrong with US democracy, such as Electoral College, massive voter suppression (especially minorities and poor), big money and low voter turnout. These have nothing to do with Russia.

0,"My point is that we need to think, and be vigilant of our rights:  We need to wake up, and not be played by the puppet masters jerking our strings through the TV.  A nation of TV watchers elected Trump, and trust him to run the country for them while they're busy playing video games and buying more stuff---But he didn't plan on winning and doesn't really have any idea how to govern now that he's won.  I'm sure Trump looked at the election, even if he did win, as the most important popularity contest in the world, and so it is; now that he's won, he's relying on the people around him to flesh out a government, and they're doing it in a predictable fashion.  We can't be merely responders to media stimuli anymore; reactionaries, subjects---We have to take the reins of our destiny into our own hands for a change.  Trump's a good thing in this sense:  Leave the driving to him?  Huh uh.

0,"The US Tax Gap has steadily increased from ~$400B to $450B today. This loss of revenue is not due to wealthy tax evaders, but due to non-compliance and the average Joe trying to cheat the taxman a few hundred dollars here, and a few hundred there.

0,"My sympathies on the rotator cuff issues, AAJ. I've been there so I know what you're going through.  Trump's refusal to acknowledge Russia's role in influencing the election is typical of the man. As always, he places his own needs -- in this case, the need to be seen as having been legitimately elected -- above all else. To hell with national security, as long as his ego doesn't get bruised.  We've had arrogant presidents before, God knows. We've also had self-centered presidents, presidents who couldn't control their tempers, dangerously stubborn presidents, and presidents with serious deficiencies in diplomacy and administration. But I can't recall ever, in the history of this nation, a president with such a complete combination of those qualities.  Buckle up.

Only I can fix it,"""" etc. He claims to be the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac: """"When I see them I just can't help myself... when you're famous they just let you do it""""  The more general meaning of """"maniac"""" is someone who engages in wild, reckless, dangerous behaviour, like a maniac driver. China is a significant adversary, yet within days Trump unnecessarily pokes the Chinese on a matter of great sensitivity to them, Taiwan. The US needs support from the people of Iraq yet he has said repeatedly that the US should have taken the oil before leaving and if the opportunity should arise, the should not miss the opportunity to do so.  It is not uncivil to call a spade a spade when there is abundant evidence.

What Trump wanted is to keep Bernie voters from supporting Clinton.  And he enlisted the help of business associates in the Russian oligarchy.   That would be the 'business' way to  get deals done.  Trump's moral compass is to win and get what you want.   Losers drool.

We aren't talking about that ... that Obama jumped to a conclusion about the source of the gas and wanted to take us to war for it. Who gave him the false intelligence that claimed Assad did it? The same administrative state that told George W Bush that Saddam was seeking yellow-cake uranium.  Now Trump has fallen for the same fake news from the administrative state.  Maybe the problem isn't the politicians, but the bureaucracy that stays in place from one administration to the next and does not want to lose its power, so manipulates the politicians to do what the real rulers want.

So what's he gong to do? Put the bite on all those voters, or trump (the """"t"""" could be either lower or upper case and still be correct) up some sort of misconduct charge and get those Senators removed from office?  Another possibility is that Trump has read the Constitution but didn't get it. By any chance, has there been a study regarding whether narcissistic sociopathic tendencies trump (definitely a lower-case """"t"""" this time) reading comprehension skills?

0,"Actually, it shows that you don't know anything about health insurance, Obamacare, Trumpcare and the reality of trying to run a business in Hawaii.  Try paying $1,200 per month per employee for HMSA.  In reality the Kabuki play the Democrats in Congress are playing is rather wonderful as they cry crocodile tears for Comey and the Obamacare repeal legislation.  In reality, they are rejoicing both.  Within the last year, practically every Democrat has blamed Comey for working for Hillary's defeat, so now they champion him?  With Trumpcare the Democrats want its passage because it gets rid of the """"Cadillac Tax"""" that hurts union health care benefits.  If Trumpcare doesn't pass, the GOP should just implement the """"Cadillac Tax"""" immediately (since Dems have deferred it for 4 years now) in order to pay for the Obamacare cost and watch the Democrats try to tell all the union members that it is not their fault Obama imposed a 40% tax on their health benefits to pay for Obamacare.

1,"You are welcome to join the 21st century. I'm quite sure, we black folks know our history better than you. We know who the murderers were. That is why we know most of the racists in the in the 21st century endorse Trump. That makes the Republicans in the 21st century a white identity party. Don't take my word for it. Check out the Storm Front website. Klansman, David Duke, is on record endorsing Trump. The only thing the GOP has for black folks are police bullets. At least the Democrats will let us vote. The GOP is doing everything they can to prevent black folks from voting. The Democrats are just the lesser of 2 evils.

0,"Then, based on this comment of yours, I don't understand what your point really is.  You present with a mixed-up jumble of thought and anxiety that I don't think many follow.  I understand your wish for protection - that is shared by all of us and is nothing unique to a few.  And I have some real faith in our Homeland Security to protect us from other 9/11's and we have the proof they have done that for 15 years now.  And when I think about how determined those terrorists from ISIL and the other groups that would do us harm, and those in the US who sympathize with them, I am amazed at how few incidents we have really had.  So, I am certain that far more has and is being done than perhaps you can give credit for.  We will never be 100% safe from it - we never have been!  But I caution against the widespread fear that people like Trump are sowing for our collective consciousness, and which you are unfortunately showing some signs of.  We have the 2nd Amendment: no threat to gun owners.

0,"I'm afraid the """"blurring"""" is really between how the corporate 1% and their control over politics and the media blur reality. Entertainment is a mere distraction and is a basic need of human nature. Trump's victory over the entrenched bureaucratic neo-cons, and the CIA attempted coup is the real political narrative. The wealthy power elite will still remain in control with Trump, despite Trump dressing himself up in a working man's baseball hat. With Trump, we will remain captive to commerce without morality, politics without principals, and a media without the essential clarity of the problems that face us. I do hope that Ms. Downey, in her new position can focus, without a blur, on what is important in these interesting times.

0,"Trump's notoriety in intimidating his business opponents are well documented. He had an enormous war chest that usually overwhelmed his enemies. He steamrolled all of them the past 30 years. Not anymore. Trump has now run into a brick wall. It's called the FBI and the entire IC (Intelligence Community) who he mistakenly declared open warfare a few days into his presidency. Trump is now paying the price. After the ill-advised firing of FBI Director Comey, you can bet there are hundreds, maybe thousands, within the 26,000 strong FBI, now hell bent on bringing down the Trump House and his Mafia like family at ALL cost. These G Men are loyal to J Edgar Hoover's creation - the FBI. Not to mention the several intelligence agencies Trump has continuously disparaged at every opportunity. Add to this formidable mix, is Special Prosecutor Mueller and his 15 seasoned prosecutors sifting through all the evidence they can uncover.

Trump is a con artist; if he """"wins"""" it's by cheating. Just like he did to get into the Oval Office.

I have to admit to being a very, very BIG Donald Trump fan. Why? Because, unlike politicians here in Canada, President Donny was upfront about the promises he made during the election campaign. Everything that he promised to do has come to fruition including scrapping the Climate Change Scam treaty.  And none of this Happy HS about drawing Red Lines in Syria. This man, Mr.Trump, means what he says and will protect the innocent in Syria from any future chemical warfare. Have a nice and safe Canada Day weekend,  Don, but like other crybaby liberals, I just know that you will mope around  all weekend long thinking about President Donny, a true gentleman.

It doesn't much matter whether he is right or not, but how he expresses his version of the truth.  He may not be wrong in his assessment of defense contracts, but singling out individual corporations in whimsical pronouncements is destabilizing in any industry. Things are the way they are for a reason. Sometimes the reason is that shocking the system can have such far reaching and damaging consequences to society that reproach and change are handled delicately and diplomatically.  Clearly that horse has left the barn, and it will be very interesting to see how this develops. Trump is attacking friend and foe alike. Soon they may all come to the same conclusion that the enemy of their enemy is their friend, and Trump can bluster all he wants, but he will have squandered his political capital by then.

Denver and Boulder do not represent the interests of the rest of the state, and have about 17% of the population.  Yet they control the state's Presidential vote.  The overwhelming 60% advantage for for Hillary in 17% of the population was 10.2% of the state, enough to offset the majority of 6% for Trump in the rest of the state.  This phenomenon happens all over the country.  The Democrats win the urban centers and college towns by large majorities, and the suburban and urban areas where most of the people live vote conservative, but not by a wide enough margin to overcome the huge Democrat advantage in the cites ... until last year.

I didn't vote for President Trump, but one thing I find most Trump voters wanted was a fresh, non-government approach to governance. They are fed up to puking with the business-as-usual of the last several administrations and they want people in critical positions who see things with fresh eyes.  You can philosophically disagree with that, and I'm sure Hillary Clinton would have appointed some career diplomat (cough, collaborator) to that position, but she didn't win the election, so the folks who voted against her and her way of doing things get a voice right now.

Just like thinking Trump is an aberration - he's not. Sad to admit, he's exactly what we deserve and created for ourselves, just one more poor excuse of a leader of this country, one after the other, since we realized we could rule the world, embarking upon empire building for money, wealth, and power - greed.

However, depending on how well one's parents greased the skids on the local draft boards, a kid with good connections could get a 1Y classification. Even assuming Trump had a bone spur, it was his connections that got him declared unfit for service. Meanwhile, every kid off the street with an IQ over 70 got sucked in as cannon fodder. Inner-city black kids were inducted in huge drafts that had the effect of ending urban riots.  Trump got out because he was privileged. Clinton, a Fulbright scholar to Oxford College in England, got out because of talent and a 1S. Trump had no such talent, he was a privileged rich kid whose father had local connections.  I have a lot of friends, most of whom didn't serve. I have no resentment. What's done is past. What I want now from our president is competent leadership. That is what's lacking.

0,"I grew up in eastern PA, in a steel town.  I watched as the mill closed down and my friend's fathers ended up losing their jobs, many of those guys never recovered.  There weren't jobs to be found, those guys blamed everybody for their problems, but the writing had been on the wall for years, some left and some pushed their kids to go to college, instead of just planning on working in the mill when they graduated high school.  Its tough though, for many it is a way of life that they have had for generations.  Ultimately, those jobs probably aren't coming back, but Trump did a masterful job at lying to them and saying that he would fix it.  When he can't, he will just blame liberals, or ignore the issue altogether.

Let's wait for Boeing to prove they were """"materially harmed"""" by the sale of a plane which doesn't compete with any plane they actually manufacture. They voluntarily abandoned that field to BBD and the C-Series. Nor does it sound as if BBD's C-series harmed Boeing's orders for 737s (4,400 are currently on order). More important still, let's also wait for the new NAFTA and a judgment through its preserved Chapter 19. The U.S. Department of Commerce's 220% punitive duty is not so much """"absurd"""" as it is a cynically strategic measure that fulfills Trump's wishes. It attempts to stop any U.S. airline from doing other than """"buy American,"""" and it shows that trade disputes between Canada and the U.S. must not be allowed to be resolved by U.S. courts. The more objective and balanced Chapter 19 mechanism MUST be retained, otherwise NAFTA will be rendered meaningless. Meanwhile, Boeing, your Super-Hornet sale to Canada hangs in the balance.

But what does it say about Trumps supporters that so many millions of them can't see through the boorish, confrontational attitude of the man? How can so many Americans have devolved into such anger, fear and irrationality that they would/could find redemption in Trump after how he has exposed his true narcissistic self for all to see. When you've lost the Jennifer Rubins and Charles Krauthammer's of the media world you've lost the battle yet the Trumpian cult members will soldier on and then become even angrier and more full of fear after the election.

It wasn't because of """"unequal"""" treatment of the Trump base.  It was because, despite the core dogma of conservatives, the Trump base is the one with the most hands extended with palms up, expecting governmental largesse (either through direct aid or unfair policy).  Obama basically performed an economic miracle through his even-handedness, that appeared in the form of recovery from the recession.  Trump, and the cynicallly needy who support him, are doing their best to reverse that.  To, """"Make America Great Again"""".  Think about that.

His tax plan will drive the debt up at an even faster rate while sending the tax savings to the rich: http://fortune.com/2015/12/23/donald-trump-plan-tax-policy-center/ and this is one of the few things he has been specific about, other than getting Mexico to pay for his wall. Who will pay for eradicating ISIL? He doesn't say at all. I'm surprised all the deficit hawks aren't up in arms about Trump's willingness to cut taxes and spend even more money he doesn't have.  Meanwhile, Sanders has the guts to say that his plans will require new taxes and shows exactly where he would get the money needed.

Many Americans do not believe that removing historical statues is a wise thing to do.

Its about time Qatar spent for its own defense, rather than relying on the U.S. Though tiny, Qatar is in a volatile region surrounded by enemies.  Saudi Arabia should be the real concern.  Saudi Arabia has used its vast oil wealth to dominate the region.  It is actively bombing and invading Yemen, killing thousands of innocents and starving the population with a naval blockade.

Because Singh is the embodiment of the G & M's top priority agenda - increased immigration and multiculturalism. The G & M wants Canadians to believe that millions of Canadian suburbanites will vote for Singh, not in spite of his being a Sikh with a beard and a turban, but because he's a Sikh with a beard and a turban, he is the personification of the new multicultural Canada. But clearly, going forward to the 2019 election, after months of glorifying Singh as an amazing new leader of the new multicultural Canada, well ahead of the next election they will again demonize the NDP as fiscal incompetents who would run the economy into the ground. Clever propagandizing by the G & M.

Just to blame Obama without recognizing the evident racism among Republicans against his policies is ill considered.  Now that they have the full reins of government, let the Republicans clean up the resulting mess from the left-overs of the financial ruin Obama inherited but remedied, despite the Republicans, to the new Presidential administration that has no respect for anything, including truth.  A Chinese curse wishes one to live in “interesting times.”  In that sense, it will be increasingly “interesting” to watch the development of foreign policy and environmental and fiscal responsibility under President Trump.

Nixon was forced to respond to the triple whammy of a rampant civil rights movement, a powerful anti-war movement, and an effective environmental revolution, whatever his other faults:  One can only hope that Trump, with his autocratic and divisive style, sparks such revolutions and is forced, as a servant of the public, to respond to them in kind.  The difference is that back then the media was more diversified in ownership, and public movements were able to gain control of its coverage to their advantage.  Now it's owned by a mere handful of polarized interests, which Trump is able to control by making outrageous statements and then denying them

This is part of the far right idea to put Americans first and take care of Americans and not insurance companies. Steve Bannon recently said he still sides with the idea of a Canadian type single payer system. Now some moderate Republicans are saying they are supportive of Obamacare and want to fix it-- they said it should not be called repealing it, but fixing it.

The Trump administration is doing its best, by deportations and denials, to make America into a homogenous white nation. The Statue of Liberty is our symbol, and she has been denigrated and may be in danger of alteration or removal.  Trump has shown he wants to destroy the work of those who came before him.

The war criminal who has propped up a bloody dictator and ruthlessly bombed civilians in Syria. The corrupt richest man on the planet whose greatest goal is the destruction of the USA and who has just pulled off the cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor.

Trump used the White House, its many ornate rooms and the power of the Oval Office, to chat up senior lawmakers from both parties, and to impress corporate executives and union workers.  Obama clung to his senior staff and thick briefing books. But Trump kicked off his tenure with what amounts to a charm offensive, bringing in CEOs and congressional leaders on Monday and Tuesday.

I know if I had a million educated, astute, connected women telling me I needed to watch out I certainly wouldn't double down on the kinds of insults and stupid rationalizations rampant in this board -- among other media outlets. Clearly, he needs to acknowledge that if he doesn't clean up his act, he's toast.

0,"The complete delusion of those who think this is a real 'win' is astonishing.  Trump, Brexit, Le Pen - they are not facsist, they are not the 'same thing' - but they have in common some anti institutional sentiment.  Instead of reforming, the institutions are hardening their position.  The EU will push for more federalization even as the continent is against it.  Only about 20% of EU citizens want 'more EU'. About 50% of them want it 'the same' - and about 30% want 'less EU'. Broadly.  And yet they push for more? And expect the problem to go away?  It's similar to the immigration issue in Canada: almost nobody wants more immigration. Almost identical numbers, i.e. just under 50% want 'the same', about 25% want 'more' and 30% want 'less' - and yet the government wants to increase numbers radically.  It demonstrates how dumb the plebes are and how easily we are mollified by misrepresentations in the press.

If you want to change the finding of Roe on when personhood starts, go to Congress, not the Courts, not the states. I am sure the leadership of the movement knows about this option and won’t go there for reasons which I have previously states.

0,"Most of Canada's brightest and best high tech people move to the US in any event because there are not enough world class tech jobs available in Canada.  When I studied Math at the University of Waterloo the singe largest employer of Waterloo IT grads was Microsoft.  Lower tech salaries in Canada have everything to do with supply and demand.  Too many qualified people and not enough high end jobs.  I predict large tech companies will establish centers of excellence or tech hubs in Canada to retain their star employees discriminated against by Trump's policies.  These hubs will create domestic opportunities for tech people who have decided to stay in Canada.  I only see a win in this situation.

0,"Translation: No, I am not going to spend a lot of time writing of the politics of Trump or Clinton, as it seems each time I do the other side writes me off. So I will be writing a long series of articles that no one can disagree with, though they also are pretty much blather. If I talk about the horrid lives veterans live thanks to the murderous war crimes of Bush, I lose my Republican friends. If I talk about the insanity of NAFTA that was brought to America thanks to both Bush and Clinton, I lose the support of far right editors and papers. If I talk about the good that government can do, say when it spent money on public housing so people didn't live under bridges, I lose the far right. If I talk about the insanity of Israel, my true friend, and its apartheid ways, I lose everything, since treating Palestinian rights fairly is the true third rail of the far right of both America and Israel. So here I am, mumbling about stuff no one disagrees with. Hugh Massengill, Eugene

1,"Well I see that one of my comments to you was downrated for """"incivility"""" or just plain gang censorship. Good work anti first amendment people.  There is no such thing as clean coal. Cleaner coal is a possibility but even taking the entire tops off mountains to get at the coal is too expensive to compete with the vast surplus of natural gas. Market forces have made coal obsolete and I believe trump knew that when he lied to the people of Appalachia that he would bring back those jobs. Power plant owners have already made the switch to cleaner natural gas. The coal industry is a thing of the past. Clinton promised to create jobs for the unemployed miners with training programs that are the future. Trump lied and got the votes. People are so naive and gullible that they would accept the hollow promises of a man who promised they would not have to move into the future while Clinton was honestly telling them that a better future was possible in spite of coal mines closing.

On the other hand, Trump has doubts about anthropocentric caused global warming while fully aware and acknowledging of the fact and pace of global warming so he will act on it.   Hillary puts that higher on her list of things she'll act on.   Logically, voting for Trump is more important for larger animals and humans, since it diminishes the likelihood of a warlike America with troops on foreign soil catalyzing by accident a nuclear war.  He will also respond to global warming, just doesn't yet claim certainty that humans are causing any significant amount of it.  To me, that's a powerful argument for Trump.

Then there's Hillary allowing Rosatom, the Russian State Nuclear Agency, to buy assets that amounted to 20 percent of American uranium.

They are simply raising questions and doing their job in terms of investigating and being critical. The media doesn't owe allegiance to any politician or policy.  So saying """"accused by the media"""" was a misstep. But the fact that the media even circulated absurd conspiracy theories like that could have been reason for him to discredit the media. But I don't recall him telling anyone to just stop listening to the media wholesale because of that.  The problem with most of the 24/7 media outlets is that they conflate opinion with fact and they think that for any issue there are two equally valid conservative and liberal opinions on the topic. So by circulating the idea that Obama is muslim or not a native born U.S. citizen they give traction to absurd ideas. Trump knows how to play this game, clearly. Now the media is no longer useful to him and is a threat.

Take the firing of FBI Jame Comey. Why fire Comey now?  Because Comey's boss, Rod Rosentein was waiting to be confirm from the stalled Democrats in the U.S. Senate.  Rosenstein was confirm two weeks ago by a 94-6.  As soon as Rosenstein got into office,  and gathering information on Comey, than Rosenstein recommended to Athorney General to fire James Comey.  The recommendation was sent to President Trump who agreed and Comey was fired today. The main reason JAmes Comey was fired because he gave a pass to Hillary Clinton email last July.  Evidence showed Hillary committed a crime and deserve jail time.  Any human being would have been prosecuted, but not Hillary Clinton.

0,"Aren't """"children"""", up to the age of 26, covered by the parents' insurance plans?  I believe President Trump indicated he wouldn't change this.  Why the big push to keep Medicaid?  Under the law, most people must have health coverage or pay a fee. But you won’t have to pay this fee if you live in a state that hasn’t expanded Medicaid and you would have qualified if it had. If you can't afford any health plan and don’t qualify for coverage through Medicaid you can get low-cost health care at a community health center which can refer you to specialized care, including mental health.  There are plenty of these health centers in Alaska:  http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/HealthPlanning/Documents/primarycare/FQHC%20List.pdf  We also have the Indian Health Service.  Kids covered by parents until 26, Natives free healthcare at IHS, workers through employers or Marketplace.  Disabled already covered. Retired and active military covered by VA/Tri Care....yet we need more $$ for Medicaid?

0,"You see, the problem is that he has not yet put any policies on the table that I can analyze.  The immigration thing was a campaign promise and in the overall context of American prosperity, unimportant.  When policies on taxes, war, medical care, etc. are put on the table, the policies can be discussed, alternatives considered, and mature consideration of national options can take place.  This will require the libber population to behave more responsibly and turn away from personality bashing and focus on issues.  By the way, I love how the media is not reporting that the federal government subsidy of expanded ACA medicaid was set to expire as it was leaving expanded medicaid a financial nightmare for the states.

The bullets, gun and tanks that were used to invade S.Korea in the late 40's were from Stalin and the USSR.  China only became involed when the US pushed too close to their border with N. Korea.  China warned the US to stop short many times before China entered the Korean War.  The bullets, SAM's, guns used by Uncle Ho in Viet Nam to kill 52,000 Americans were from the USSR.  Missiles that shot down John McCain's jet were made in USSR, the Viet Cong were trained by the Russian advisors.  We had to save Berlin right after WWII, with the Berlin Airlift of food, coal and medicines because the Russians shut down rail and road transport. For 50 years it was USSR tanks that we guarded from coming over the Fulda Gap or Berlin gates.  Putin has already invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.

When she lost, that left the Democrats without a national plan.

So the ban would also apply to Christians and Jews and all citizens of that nation.  Secondarily, what """"extra vetting"""" are you refering to? Travellers from these nations were always vetted and the President has always had the obligation and authority to enhance the vetting process if there are issues. No one disputes this. And consider that Trump said he needed the ban for 90 days to get his extra vetting in place. It's been over 90 days so the extra vetting should be in place (unless Trump lied about that).

You don't play chicken with nukes, and especially not when an unpredictable regime like the DPRK is involved.

0,"Justerien better play nice with Trump. Investigation has already begun on the possibly propped up Canadian softwood lumber industry. Commerce Department will determine whether dumping took place while the International Trade Commission will decide if the U.S. industry was materially injured or threatened. If the commission determines by Jan. 9 that Canadian softwood harmed the U.S. lumber sector, it will issue preliminary countervailing duties on Feb. 21 and preliminary anti-dumping duties on May 4, unless those deadlines are extended. Canada exported about US$4.5 billion worth of lumber to the U.S. last year, according to the Commerce Department. The U.S. Lumber Coalition alleges that provincial governments, which own most of Canada's vast timberlands, provide trees to Canadian producers at rates far below market value, along with other subsidies. As a result, the group says Canadian lumber is being sold for less than fair value in the U.S., hurting mills, workers and communities.

0,"The Federal courts are the only thing standing in the way of one-man rule. And Trump is now trying to delegitimize the Federal courts through a campaign of outright lies and twitter attacks.

Notably missing from the list are several Muslim-majority countries where Trump has business dealings and countries that actually originated terrorists  who killed Americans.

Everything you have said is a conspiracy pushed by the far right, you are part of the problem, not the solution.  Trump is conning everyone. The advisors that he picked to help him have been trying to get out the message and set a tone then Trump gets up and goes on a tirade on tweeter blaming everyone for things that he has done and said.  His twitter has been a means of being a bully to everyone that Trump doesn't like. Hell that very same twitter might be used in a witness tampering case because he tried to use his tweet to bully Yates and Comey while they were on the stand.  Also, conspiracies never work past a handful of people. Thinking everyone in the USA is part of a conspiracy is crazy talk.

No retired military person is allowed to take financial compensation from a foreign government and Flynn knew that or worse after a career in the US military he didn't know the plainly stated rules.

Most of those present spoke of their great fear that Trump was going to take their healthcare away, as many had their insurance through the ACA, seeing that the GOP had never produced a better alternative for replacement plan.  Those coal miners and their families (including their ill parents, or ill children) had often gone uninsured before the ACA.  They still supported Trump, but not on the repeal of Obamacare.  Amazing how afraid they were, justifiably so, and that is became clear to them at just how unjust Trump could be in such vital areas.  This is going to grow as more people face the realities of what this madman has done to them.

The problem with that is that she hasn't tried to beat up on the accusers, but privately made a disparaging comment to a friend long ago about the complainant in one case, a communication that was only revealed when Hillary's friend died and someone went through her notes or journals and found mention of it. Trump clearly is a sexual assaulter, based on the very similar testimony of so many victims. My bigger problems with him are that he's such a impetuous screwball that he could quickly kill everyone on earth by precipitating a nuclear war, that the leaders of other countries would know they were dealing with a pathological liar, complicating foreign relationships, he wouldn't begin to deal with climate change, and would appoint nutcases to federal courts.

However, I have never heard Trump say he wanted to get rid of the Department of Energy. However who knows what he will do ?  He changes his mind every day on stuff so who knows. However how would you like to be someone who works at the Energy Department and find out that you new leader is someone who thinks your department should be eliminated.?

It matters that we vote, and vote with a knowledge of the history of the candidates in mind.  It matters we vote responsibly and not emotionally or based on """"trumped-up"""" fears.  Democracy is beautiful just like the RC Church.  However, both of these entities require all of their members to stay awake and care deeply that their basic ideals are supported by those who would lead them and be willing to aggressively fight against those who would corrupt them.  Democracy needs voters that love her enough to vote for the best person to lead, the most sane an qualified individual, even if you don't love that person's personality.  Comparatively, The Roman Catholic Church needs a laity that demands it's leaders behave according to Christ's Gospel and Christ's Commands.

If Trump/GOP were not such idiots, they would realize that SPace is RIGHT on the edge of that, but they continue to throw 5-10B at the SLS and take the COMMUNIST approach to it, while O/Bolden pushed New Space, which is where 100% of our space growth currently is.  The other big one is that Tesla is forcing car makers to go to EVs. This will change the economy to a LARGE degree.

0,"Yeah, Boots, those are good points.  I guess  if you believe what's in movies, at some point Pence could push the nuclear button based on a belief (or reality) that God told him to.  But, there's not indication that he would go that far.  THERE IS INDICATION THAT TRUMP is so morally devoid of ability to value human life, that he would do it to serve somthing else that is on FULL DISPLAY.  So, I think you gotta deal with what's in front of you.  With Trump and anyone else, it's not about the choice between two evils.  It's existential, man.  That's the risk.  He's already politically blown up the country, and appears to LOVE IT.  Not to achieve an end, not to prusue a policy agenda.  Just to feed that thing that drives him.  But, as I said before, Pence is next in line period.  It is the result, according to law, if the morally, politically, and logically right thing is done, and Trump is divested ot POTUS authority.

Positively White Supremacist Groups/Neo Nazis are horrible groups that do not represent what America stands for.

President Trump is not making the moral equivalency of the groups but just pointing out that you cannot call out one disgusting group while ignoring others, such as what the Democrats/Main Street Media does on a regular basis. Right now, Congress has a 12% approval rating and the media has a 6% approval rating and based on the histrionics of the past couple of days, I see both these number dropping even further.

The majority are harder working than many of us native born.  They own businesses, work in factories, and so forth.  It was also pointed out the other hypocrisy about immigrants taking US jobs.  If this were a bad scenarios why was there a recent expose of construction companies being brought in with immigration loop holes to have temporary workers from East Europe build the factories for auto plants?   Americans are very good at welding, masonry and other construction jobs.  Second Trump himself imported dozens of foreigners to work at Mara Largo.  How hare did he work to recruit Florida workers?

0,"As little as I like Trump, WE ALL are responsible for him sitting in the White House.  I agree 100% on your description of him, but as a nation we elected him.  This idea that he isn't my president, because I didn't vote for him is half the problem with our country today.  We spend too much time demonizing the politicians or supporters of those politicians we disagree with, or acting like they got elected in a vacuum.  They didn't.  Those politicians were elected by all of us, even those who didn't vote for them.  As a society, we have all laid the groundwork for the Trumps of this world to get elected.  Sadly, I think that even crazy Roy Moore is going to win, exactly because we have all spent so much time getting entrenched in this idea that the opposition is somehow Un-American.

Why not to hold it there, just as good as any other place.  Meanwhile:  Democrats Seethe After Georgia Loss: ‘Our Brand Is Worse Than Trump’  ‘They Are Never Talking about Issues Like Russia’  That quote from Ohio Democratic representative Tim Ryan in the New York Times is going to get a lot of attention; for Republicans it’s a reason for glee and for Democrats, a devastating self-assessment that challenges them on an almost existential level.  But the comment that probably ought to spur even more thought in Democratic lawmakers’ offices is this one from Chris Murphy, who dares to utter the heretical thought that the preeminent obsession of Democrats since Election Day 2016 — the as-yet-unproven possibility of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign — simply is a non-factor in the lives of most Americans.

0,"Trump's Muslim Ban was considered unconstitutional by Republicans and Democrats before the Election. Rudy Giuliani has boasted they knew it was unconstitutional and so tried to write it in such a way it would pass the smell test. But the fact he boasted in public undoes their efforts as does the subsequent announcement that Syrian Christians will be exempt from the ban.  The Executive cannot question the authority a member of the Judiciary. Each of the three branches must respect the others. Sure, the President can file for a stay of the TRO, but the fact the President fired the acting AG Yates for saying the ban was unlawful will weaken his case. And don't expect judges to be flexible toward an administration that holds the Judiciary in contempt.  I laughed when Trump tweeted about Democrats in Congress delaying the approval of his cabinet nominees for purely political reasons. That's because this is POLITICS. Welcome to the Real World, Donald. Government is All Politics. 24/7

I’m always reminded of a tweet that DT Jr. sent years ago where he was praising how the hired help worked for his family over Christmas or something, and he posted like “love loyalty to us!” They are just the most openly despicable people.

I include the '60's because America still needs to integrate the poor and powerless into the culture. If the Republican Party doesn't get it together and keeps on with its three part focus on taking from the poor to give to the rich, destroying health care for the poor, and being a party (country) for rich white folks who make up the investor class, America has no chance.

Make it hurt really, really bad.  O'BamaCare was designed to crash and burn so that the next president (who was supposed to be a democrat) would throw up her hands and say well, we tried it your way, now our solution is to shove everyone into Medicare (single payer).  Trump is not going to propose that solution.  Best he can do now is to hurry the crash along.  Trump is a process guy rather than a solution guy.  And this is part of the process.

Just the reverse: he’s embraced a succession of plans, each one worse than its predecessor, that are, every one of them, militantly anti-life, pro-sickness and pro-death. If Catholic leaders want to make amends for their collaboration in the election of this brutally anti-life president, they will address him directly. They will remind him of his promises; they will quote his own words back to him. They will demand that he produce what he promised: a plan that includes universal health care, better than the ACA and less expensive.

In short, he was a sophisticated public player compared to the bankrupt gambler and celebrity Trump.  Make no mistake, boys: this is the Rubicon.

All I ask is that you put aside your perception that you are being attacked and realistically look at one man's actions. Are they """"Presidential"""" or are they in fact the acts of a man who should be feared for the danger that he actually is. David Wright

0,"By the way. In light of Trump's speech on Tuesday even your beloved federalist has now called for him to be removed from office. Funny how you haven't linked that article. Face it. The statue was never  being protested over. It was just an excuse for Nazis to have a rally  and Trump cannot stop trying to appease a group who would like to murder even some members of his own family.  When even the federalist can no longer come up with excuses for him. It may be time for you to stop trying.

0,"Mexico doesn't need to break NAFTA. It will go through a period not too dissimilar to the '94 devaluation - we have already seen the currency depreciate 10% because of Trump, thus giving Mexico a 10% cost advantage vis a vis the US.  The difference this time is that Mexico  already has the trade relations and manufacturing capacity in place,  so they just got a whole load more competitive. The chances are they will get the kind of trade boost from their lower exchange rate that Canada has singly failed to achieve.  The added costs to US manufacturers, however, are going be painful - Ford has already written off $200 Million in investment as a result - $70 extra for every vehicle sold last year. That is going to be paid for by US consumers - just like the wall

Two corrupt factions within a corporation whose business is it is to control the political process so the owners of the corporation (the 1/10th of 1%) are not  inconvenienced come election time. It is easier for them to crush ideas that may grow bothersome ahead of an election than deal with them after the rubes have gained a little hope. Thanks to both Sanders and Trump for forcing both the D's and R's to expose this fact.  The best option when facing a rigged system may be to refuse to participate. After all, by holding your nose and voting for the lesser of evils you are only giving support to a deeply flawed and failing system. Boycotting elections is not a new tactic. It has been used in many countries more politically astute than this one.  As Emma Goldman said """"If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal.""""

Failure to enforce the laws is misfeasance in office, at the minimum.  President Trump is proposing to follow the laws passed by Congress to pander for white votes.  The 'investment in their education' was not voluntary on the part of a significant proportion of the electorate or Trump wouldn't have been elected.  Reagan permitted similar people to become citizens in his amnesty program back in the 1980's.  And included their parents as well.  That was supposed to be a one-time 'deal' and borders would be enforced thereafter.  See how well that worked?

0,"Trump didn't appear out of nowhere. Much of the bizarre garbage he's been spouting has been floating around the political commentary shows on Fox News for years. The difference is in how these conspiracy theories are approached. Until now, the GOP was content to let Fox stoke public anger and then try to leverage that anger into votes. They wouldn't actually confront these """"issues"""" because they know most of it is simply garbage.  They'd get blustery about it and then when elected, move on to real issues, while angry voters waited for someone to solve the imaginary problems Fox invented. What Trump has done is take all these false, irrational conspiracy theories and turn them into election issues. By accepting these rants at face value, Trump has gained a following from the percentage of the public who accept everything on Fox as fact. While the GOP were content to play public paranoia for votes, Trump is actually building his policy based on that paranoia. That is his core audience.

Sort of like still supporting your quarterback no matter the foul deeds he is seen doing off the field because he is the leader of your tribe. I for one will never get used to it nor allow it to be normalized anymore than I will allow the sexist, racist, bigotry of trump to be forgotten or normalized. Disgusting breeches of social norms, disgusting disrespect for women, ethnic and religious minorities, calls for his political opponent to be jailed like a tin pot dictator are unacceptable and unforgivable. That his supporters could vote for him because he said and did such nasty things  put us into a whole new and unamerican world.

The Express, Mail, and Sun constantly hammer each one of the examples I cited, especially with respect to criminal Islam -- e.g. exploitation of  British women by Muslim gangs.  In today's mostly anti-Trump WSJ, a British Dr. Dalyrymple excoriated the PC British attitude exemplified by Khan which has lead to """"creative appeasement"""" of radical Islam.  No matter how much evidence is given, including the bloody mangled bodies of innocents attacked by Islamic radicals, you will never open your eyes to the devastation they are causing.

Obama is a really smart guy, a well-educated intellectual who was at the top of his class at Harvard, who taught Constitutional law at a top university.

But here is my question: If Trump's tax plan turns out to benefit him, should we jettison it no matter what? If it hurts Trump, should we accept it no matter what? How about if it is neutral for Trump? It seems to me we should judge any tax plan on whether it is good or bad for the country as a whole, rather than for a specific individual, even if he is the one proposing it. The Democrat's statement of not even considering any tax plan until Trump releases his taxes is therefore nothing but a stalling tactic, knowing they don't have the votes to get their way. They are blatant obstructionists, and having spent the last several years accusing the Republicans of doing the same, they are also hypocrites. Big ones.

This was also the intention that lay behind the 1965 immigration act.

In the Appalachians, when the big trees were gone, before there were """"environmental protestors,"""" the logging jobs dropped after the peak of the logging. Sure, some jobs were lost when meager environmental restrictions were finally imposed.  But logging, like mining, has always been a boom and bust industry.  If the restrictions had not been enacted, the timing of the boom and bust would have been different.   Seneca timber has over a hundred thousand acres fo tree farms/ forests - why do they want to take our public forests, too?  Simple - they've overcut their own lands and want our bigger trees and the Obama and Trump administrations were happy to give them our public resources.  The protesting hasn't made much difference.  This week's events show that.  The protest might have slowed down the logging a couple days, but the clearcuts are happening anyway.

McCain sold out Americans and their health care, to vote for Obamacare, rising insurance premiums, high deductibles and no insurance at all in some counties, or no choice with just one insurance company on the exchange.  Arizona got hit hardest with Obamacare, and McCain is to blame.  Arizona got the secret waiting lists and bonuses for VA staff who killed American military veterans.  Blame McCain.

Apathy or trying to be perfect can paralyze us. We need to educate, inspire, and act as citizens to create new priorities.

Its very obvious that Mr. Trump is doing a GREAT job when the main stream establishment is trying to take him down daily.  Mr. Trump is not perfect and very brash but I tell you this is what this country needed.  To much Political PC and B$ has been going on.  Go TRUMP Go...  Washington does NOT want to change and people are not used to someone speaking the TRUTH and calling out ALL sides.  This is going to be a very interesting next 7 years.  Its time to work with the President for the future of ALL Americans.  The Dems have lost and act like spoiled children, Grow Up.  Get over it and try help make this country better, support your President !

In the case of America, its voters vote for their president directly. And still someone like Trump gets to be president

So, is Donald Trump lying? Well, it would be true to type for him to deny the existence of such tapes given his track record. But do such recordings of his meeting with James Comey still exist?  Highly unlikely. Why keep incriminating evidence. And if there were no such thing why would Trump delay answering the question about their existence for two weeks or more. The reason is for him to make a decision about what to do with them. When asked the original question about the existence of recordings with james Comey all he had to say was no. But he didn't do that. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo, there is a lot more of this story left to be told. Getting at the truth will be like pulling teeth.

I would appreciate a chance to make up my own mind on issues and the best way to do that is to hear ALL sides of the story WITHOUT loaded words, explosive headlines or nasty innuendo. Like it or not, Trump has played the media. He has beaten them at their own game. Even in this instance, Comey demonstrated he was someone who was due to be fired for breeching the privacy of a discussion in the Oval Office. If the director of the FBI doesn't get that, then maybe we need to up the standards. I know that in my role as a teacher, I would be fired if I released private information from my boss. Even the local evening news is half-filled with celebrity news and entertainment news because they simply can't fill it with more pressing news.

Meanwhile, on the Trudeau invitation, he sent that out AFTER Trump declared the 7-country ban, as a virtue signal, forgetting that (at a minimum) those already in the U.S. could decide to head north.

(See HB82) 3) Why are you giving up stagnant lease penalties, when you haven't even drafted the financial specifications yet? (See HB111) 4) Why do you repeatedly insist on taking money (PFD's) that would promote economic growth by being redistributed via purchases, mortgage payments, insurance payments, car payments & college tuition, etc., when you haven't placed moratoriums on state office remodeling, vehicle leases & purchases, duplicity of services, duplicate offices, etc.?

It could be just a reaction to the Ivy league Professors' open letter warning their students against """"groupthink"""" (an infliction suffered by many of the Commenters here) but I've notice MSNBC is becoming slightly less partisan and some members of Fox News beginning to turn slightly against Trump.

I guess you could also blame the Electoral College.  Here is an idea; move to a battleground state and vote there!  You don't have to worry about Oregon turning red.  Or do what others did, trade your vote in Oregon with a third party voter in a battle ground state.  I read about a Libertarian who got 12 votes in California for Gary Johnson for his one Hillary vote in Ohio.  But here is my best advice, become a Libertarian.

0,"I agree with this author completely. In the great battle for equal treatment under the law patience will only get you so far. Eventually you realize that power never relinquishes control of its own accord, it must always be challenged, resisted, and opposed.  On the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration we're being told that his victory was the result of white people who had decided that enough is enough when it came to their economic distress, caused by policies enacted by people they supported (something they now willfully ignore) but blamed on immigrants, people of color, Muslims, and various other """"others.""""  And now on MLK Day we're supposed to buy into the myth that their economic distress is in any way comparable to the kind of oppression endured for generations by black people living in the south, first as slaves and later as second-class citizens with no voting rights or any other rights.  As a white male, I don't think so. Delusion is not countered with patience.

0,"There is a large group of white Americans who believe that they are being short-changed in life for the benefits of others. There is a constant murmur that people in Europe and Asia are kept safe by Americans with no thanks.  Many believe that it was their ancestors who built the infrastructure of America like the highways, hospitals and schools. Immigrants arrive and take advantage of the infrastructure without paying their fair share.  What these white Americans want is a class structure where the benefits and entitlements go to them because they believe they deserve it. Donald Trump is playing up to these people by passing laws and appointing judges who will channel benefits to them.  The attacks on Barack Obama is a perfect symbol of these angers. They cry out for his school transcripts to be released because they don't believe he would have gotten into Harvard if not for Affirmative Action. There are calls for his long form birth certificate which Obama finally releases.

They separated the three main functions of government and they made freedom of speech for citizens and the press the very first amendment of their constitution.   Every sentence of the constitution is a defence againsty tyranny.  Not just tryanny from an unelected king, but also against tyranny of one elected individual seizing control of all facets of  government.  Watching Trump during this week's press conference, you could see how he was trying to quash freedom of the press, and the journalists  pushing back.

Mr. Sparhawk's rights to free speech through display of his Trump flag were unlawfully abridged by the protesters.  Eric Norstad's conclusion to the facts: Mr. Sparhawk """"provoked the incident.""""  My conclusion: Any reasonable person would disagree with Eric Norstad's conclusion. Any reasonable person would also disagree when they see or hear the news media use language inferring Milo Yiannopoulis provoked the violent riots in Berkeley, or that Mr. Trump provoked any of the violence in the recent demonstrations, as if the demonstrators do not control their own choices and actions.

In North Korea, Kim Jong Un blinked. Trade talks? We will probably end up with a better deal.  Trump does know when he speaks or acts from a strong position and dials up the theatrics and rhetoric accordingly. He is always quick to retreat when the pressure is put on however. Look at this past few days and how Trump handled Charlottesville.  There are some very smart people involved in the trade negotiations.

Yes our low income earners pay slightly less while our high income earners (>$250k) pay slightly more....but very comparable.   However that is not what attracts moths to the flame.

We have our own identity and do not need to import it from the USA.  When Harper tried to be a small version of Trump Canadians responded and voted him out. Wake up its 2016!

He's also spoken out about the """"too big to fail"""" banksters, and even force a pledge to the GOP platform to break up the six largest banks and bring back the Glass Steagall act that prohibited banks from gambling on high risk investments.  There's the Donald Trump portrayed by the corporatist media in the pocket of the Democrat establishment machine. Then there's the real Donald Trump.

Before Obamacare these same people went to the emergency room for all their health care because they can't be turned away. Just who do you think pays for the people who just don't have the money?

Sanctions and international pressure have had no demonstrable effect in preventing NK from breaking international law and UN protocols.  Very soon, President Trump is going to be faced with the awful decision of choosing between the U.S. and its allies.  If Kim is permitted to proceed as NK has done for the last 25 yrs, then the chance of the US being obliterated by this psychopath with WMDs increases exponentially.  If Mr Trump takes decisive action to decapitate Kim, thereby halting the NK nukes program, then it is likely that millions will die in SK and Japan;  conceivably, the conflict could escalate to WW III.

Given Mr Trump's temperament and his record thus far it is likely that he will try a pre-emptive strike against NK to try to save the U.S.  God help us.

Those three held true to why they were sent to Washington in the first place: to represent the people who voted them in, not to glorify donnie.

All for the true goal of the GOP trying to dump legitimate voters off the rolls.  The issue of Russian hacking of databases is unrelated to voter ID.

""""We want the [executive order] to have its own 'moment,'"""" an official told the network. A White House spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment.  Here’s the real reason for the delay: The Trump administration can’t solve the problem that has always bedeviled this policy, which is that there isn’t any credible national security rationale for it.   Unlike on the campaign trail, when you’re governing, you actually have to have justification for what you’re proposing, or you often run into trouble.

Plus instead of any of this being the topic, he name sake son has Trump stuck talking about clandestine mid-campaign meetings with Russian attorneys over agreeing to withdraw sanctions if elected in exchange for """"dirt"""" on Hillary.  So Trump responds in usual fashion, dredging up onld news about Comey as deflection. Good days are very few for Trump and friends.

It may appear like that to some, but that is not the case.  The FBI and the world’s best intelligence agencies (NSA, CIA, DIA) have been investigation allegations of Russia’s involvement and collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign since last July and have come up empty handed, and it is driving Democrats nuts.  What is intensifying is the expansion of the investigation to find and question people remotely connected to the Trump campaign, hoping to find a smoking gun where none exists.  That highly place source in the Trump tower to be question next just might be the janitor working on the top floors.  You can’t go much higher than that.

That is why they are so comfortable with racial profiling and other discriminatory policies. That policy is about white racism, not crime prevention. If it were about crime prevention, loner white men with guns would be profiled. They are the profile of mass shooters of random strangers. Instead, they are considered innocent until proven guilty. Apparently, that is just another white privilege.
"
0,"This is the typical of Trump's reign. He can't actually do what he says, his official can openly contradict him.  Trump doesn't have his own political force to back him up, he has to borrow from someone else, usually GOP, who just want to make him a figurehead.
"
0,"Mr. Trump can do nothing to bring back those jobs. Unfortunately there are going to be victims as manufacturing shifts away from established local industries. These people shouldn't be left for the scrap heap when billions of tax dollars can be wrung out of the financial industry to provide re-training and guaranteed income. There has to be a leveling out of the wealth generated in segments of the economy that are doing well to support those being left behind. If things get too unbalanced can anarchy be far away?

1,"Trump is an idiot. Sessions recused himself because he'd met with the Russian ambassador twice and had failed to disclose it to the Senate. I'm sure Trump was aware he'd met with the Russian ambassador. So many Trump team members have had dealings with the Russians. One may wonder why Jared Kushner still has security clearance.  And remember: When the adoption of Russia babies is mentioned, that's tied to the sanctions imposed on Russia by the USA. It doesn't sound so innocent when you mention that.  Trump seems confused by the phrase """"conflict of interest"""". He accuses Mueller and Comey and others of having conflicts of interest when what he seems to mean is that their interests conflict with his interests. That's a completely different matter. It's not in Trump's interest to have his business ties to Russia investigated, but it is in the interest of inquiry into Russian meddling in the election.  Trump must know that he should recuse himself from the investigation. He's not the FBI.
"
1,".  """"A U.N. human rights expert voiced alarm on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump might allow torture in interrogations, warning that it “lays down the gauntlet” for other countries to follow suit.""""  Trump's comments regarding the desirability of torturing prisoners essentially gives America's enemies an endorsement to torture American soldiers in captivity.  I'm sure that the frontline American soldiers serving in war zones appreciate their President giving moral cover  to their enemies to torture them.  Of course, Mr. Trump can point to his background of service to his country, when his country called on him to come forward.  During the Vietnam war, Trump took four student draft deferrals and, when those ran out his wealthy daddy found a doctor to diagnose the college football star athlete as unfit due to a bone spur on one foot.  When the draft ended, Trump's """"bone spur"""" was miraculously healed.  Donald Trump, bringing new meaning to the word """"hypocrite"""".  .

One of the reasons one politician opposed the bridge is she """" didn't want Anchorage tax dollars escaping to the Mat-Su.""""  The best reason for building the bridge was it would open up affordable home sites to people who otherwise couldn't afford them.   In the past week I've been looking for land in Anchorage to help someone build a home . It's impossible to find even moderately priced land.    Once the dust settles over the states financial situation and IF we come out the other side ok ,  at that time the bridge might get built. The way business's are shutting down and job losses are climbing , adding the loss of our PFD in a mater of two or three years, none of it may matter.  We might turn into a ghost town of sorts.  It probably won't be that bad---but right now the future looks bleak.  If elected , Trump will have a major positive impact on Alaska and it's economy.

One little speck of life in a very large and hostile cosmos where one of the greatest present dangers we face is, as Pogo so eloquently pointed out, ourselves - people and nations too often with an apparent inability to see beyond our own narrow, oftentimes selfish, interests. Mr Trump epitomizes the self-absorbed mindset concerned only about self-aggrandizement, seeking advantage by any means and not caring about the consequences of his actions on others. We wonder how Americans could give him the presidency, we might also do well to ponder the """"why"""" question more as well.

"
0,"Well, perhaps you're right.   But that was kind of the point I was trying to make (obviously not very well) - that it isn't eg:  General Lee who is the problem.   It's the mere fact that there were people LONG after the Civil War ended who thought the monuments were appropriate.    THIS is the historical fact that is lost when the monument is simply removed - like it was never there in the first place.     And that's why I thought leaving them up - juxtaposed with another monument or enhanced with an explanatory plaque would be more effective.  One thing I'm convinced of is that the removal of these monuments has done more to rally the """"alt-right"""" than even Trump's election.

1,"Mr. Bon, Trump's language was not """"locker room"""" talk (was he in a locker room when he made those remarks, or all the remarks he's made since then?) just lewd, it was the kind of talk a sexual predator engages in. That's not locker room talk, that's talking about rape and other forms of sexual assault. How do you equate a consensual relationship between two adults, married or not, with criminal sexual assault?  However morally repugnant one may think such behavior is, it is not criminal or illegal.   I cannot recall anyone of my acquaintance ever talking about sexually assaulting a woman, even in jest. Trump's behavior is not innocuous, it is not in the distant past, and it is not common among mentally healthy people who are not sexual predators. You need to understand what is really going on here, quit minimizing Trump's horrific behavior and rethink  your priorities.

And I'm not even included the hundreds of thousands of illegals now mowing lawns, doing laundry, the cooking and cleaning in and around millions of American two-career homes.  If this administration does just 30% of what it is now considering (it likely won't do more, because it'll rival the military as an annual expenditure and would smack of a """"police state"""") it will seriously shake the economic structure of the nation.  The Pres might boast about creating jobs (ie: for legals)--should they be willing to take them--but it means much, much less discretionary income for all.

0,"Merry Christmas Gerald.  The world will be ok.   If Trump screws up, let someone else come in and try something else in 4 years.  The americans want to try something different.  His cabinet at least is filled with people from the private sector, instead of just lawyers and academia.   His secretary of state spent decades going round the world successfully negotiating deals for Exxon-Mobil.   Compare that against John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and what they did in Iran Syria and Libya and you have to think that maybe T.Rex can't get any worse than those two.  The cabinet members are generally surprisingly successful people collectively with a over a century of private sector or military experience.  Nasim Taleb said :  in the absence of skin in the game, intellectuals and pseudo intellectuals are indistinguishable.    There is a difference between writing regulations about businesses and the ability to run a business.  Just look at Jonathan Gruber and the ACA debacle.

In fact the entire North American mainstream media is leftist with the exception of Fox.  Breitbart and Infowars are the main reasons Trump won as they are anti-establishment, freedom loving and USA constitutionalist.  The leftist mainstream media paints them as far right or the new phrase which I don't even know what they are talking about which is alt-right.  I would call them centrists historically due to their belief in the USA constitution.  Its just that our whole society is very left wing so it feels like they are to the right.

Then that person in the private individual market won't be able to purchase insurance that will cover their newly labeled """"pre-existing condition"""", even if they don't go a day without insurance. That's the way it worked before in the individual market. Here's another news flash, medical inflation is about 5% per year. The current private insurance """"age tax"""" adds another 3% to 4% a year on an overall average, as the subscriber gets older, which the lucky ones do. As you cut subsidies for people in the pool, more currently healthy people of all ages drop out. That makes the pool worse, so rates go up even more for those that already don't get a subsidy.

Apple contracts out the manufacturing but keeps the programming jobs in the United States, plus spends over 12 Billion USD on R&D, pays dividends to its shareholders which generates income tax to the U.S., and is building a massive circular head office in California. This business model is not a manufacturing business, but it does generate high end jobs in the United States, plus retail jobs as well, but the U.S. benefits mightily from the overseas sales which support the infrastructure in the United States, and the high U.S. corporate income tax. It depends too on companies such as Qualcomm and Samsung for parts, etc. but it also earns patents on its own.

It begins by implementing security at their borders.  It is inconvenient.  It can be unfair and unreasonable but it is an implement now and correct later policy.

Maybe, the U.S.A. and other western countries should think about allowing Muslims into their countries only after Muslims have renounced the verses in the Qur'an that call for jihad (struggle) and have renounced the verses in the Qur'an call for the destruction of Jews, Christians and non believers.

0,"Let me tell you my take on why Hillary lost. Sit down and put on a seat belt:  Hillary Clinton lost because she tried to buy the election while offering no solution to anything of importance.  After her lost to Obama and ended up with millions in debt, Hillary decided to fix it. As soon as she was named Sec. of State and cannot go and raise money, she installed her own email server so that she can still run the Clinton Foundation from it. She can hide her international work for money, power and Neo-Con agenda from Obama. This work continue after she left the State Dept. She proceeded to raise money from speeches, such as $400k from a 30 min. Goldman Sachs speech. $150 million went to her pocket. This is her fund to buy the presidential election. She was so intense in money she forgot there are problems in the country. She had no comprehension on America's real problems, no idea on fixing anything. Why let them 'eat cake'.  Trump is right. Hillary is corrupted, unfit.

Walker made matters worse when he contracted with his cronies for large $$$ amounts and then hired lobbyists (who were in cahoots with other lobbyists who work for the guys who participated in these secret meetings) to represent this Byzantine game plan to the legislature.  Meanwhile he stated that money was scarce and we had to bite the bullet.  Ideas crafted in darkness lack the transparency and accountability needed for public support.  Ditch the Gov's lobbyists.

The Cardinal is not even considering that the Church is wrong on some of the issues we are confronting (birth control is an easy one, as is the reaction to Roe and the legal implications of the Church's position).  Jesus was humble of heart, especially on moral issues.  The Church must be as well.  Flores hits the nail on the head, which is a huge contrast to Chaput.  You can tell how each bishop is voting.  Flores knows that the essential part of teaching is example.  Of course, to offer a really good example on Life, ordaining women is essential.  I bet we could get coverage if we spun Flores as anti-Trump (which is an easy guess) and highlight that both POVs were presented at the conference.

0,"Bannon isn't Trump. Trump also distanced himself from them during the election campaign.  The reason Trump did not specify the white supremacists as the source of the violence is that they were NOT the source of the violence: they applied for a permit to protest the removal of the statue of Lee and were granted one — a right defended by the ACLU when the mayor tried to refuse permission after it was granted.  While they came armed for violence, they had no intention of violence and video footage shows that. It also shows conflict arising when rival groups interfere. Had the police done their job and kept the groups separated, none of this would have happened.  Except maybe the car attack. But that was one man who is not being called a hero by the supremacists. We may not like what the alt-right is saying, but they had the right to say it.

Just because someone wants to go to college does not mean they want to suckle the gov. tit. In fact if they go to college they will receive less wealth fare than those who don't, they will also contribute more taxes over their life time, and have a more positive effect on society. Unlike the cynical commenters on here.Also It could also easily be argued geriatric, and old people shouldn't be allowed to vote, due to cognitive recession, dementia, and alzheimers.

0,"Rieder confuses the war against Germany with our stand against Nazis. Until the Japanese attacked the U.S. our country was largely isolationist, primarily sending war materials to allies. It was Germany who declared war against the U.S. due to treaty obligations with Japan. Despite the """"rumors"""" coming from Europe about Nazi atrocities, our immigration policy provided no relief to the Nazis' victims. It was only after the concentration camps were liberated, and the world suffered the full impact of what was done there, that the U.S. took a firm stand against Nazism. As to President Trump not having issued a condemnation of white supremacist ideology, Rieder seems blind or deaf to the fact that the President did so. The fault is that the condemnation was not in his first public statement. The Greatest Generation was indeed that; sacrificing lives, families, homes, rolling up sleeves, etc. However, it did not do so entirely of its own accord. It was Japan who woke the sleeping giant.

0,"That rule change was necessary. The Republicans were, at the time, refusing to confirm anybody, and the US government, especially the federal court system, was grinding to a halt in consequence. Absent the rule change, the Democrats would no doubt now be doing the same thing. There are offices that need to be filled and jobs that need to be done.  Government departments need ministers (the Americans call them Secretaries), administrative tribunals need administrators, and courts need judges.  Even Trump's picks are better than vacant offices.  Given the current dysfunction, allowing filibusters of presidential appointments is a way of ensuring that the government of the US grinds to a halt. For the last two years, the Republicans have had a majority in the Senate, and so there have been effectively no confirmations, leaving Trump a lot of vancancies, including one on SCOTUS, to fill.

At the time, Trump was yelling """"Lock her up!"""" Comey did Trump a huge favor. That was then, this is now. The tables have turned, and Trump is feeling the heat.

They were on board with this because the affected U S  Industries want it;  in fact have worked for years and years to secure International co operation for it thru the Montreal Protocol.  And, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing substitutes .   So, after at least seven years of contentious efforts the Kigali agreement was inked in late 2016. Perhaps the best solution at this juncture would be for Congress to go ahead and ratify  the  the Kilgali Agreement.  Otherwise U S Industry will unnecessarily  suffer in International trade.

Those already in the U.S. certainly have some grounds for redress, but not based on Korematsu, as no one has been interred. Those who are not in the country have no rights under our constitution, yet the courts ruled as if they do. That amounts to making law, not upholding existing law as the judiciary is charged to do.

His choices have all been grounded in a desire to make an historic shift in direction for America. Whether that shift will bring renewed vitality will be tested in four years. I, for one am willing to wait a couple of years before evaluating the effects of his choices. Gov. Perry appears to be a good choice for Energy. As Governor of Texas he had lots of contact with energy producers. He should be able to bring back a more realistic view and policy position on energy production in this country. Yes, he has flaws. He is a republican after all (just a bit of humor). He will be attacked by the 'left,' supported by the 'right' and ignored by the majority of Americans. It will be an 'Interesting' few years interesting in all it 'Chinese Curse' meaning.

He went into politics only late in life, primarily as a stunt to build his brand and as a vanity project. He never bothered with any other service in his whole life, and his faux philanthropy was all wired back to him some how in terms of net gain.  Trudeau (only an average politician, yes) by comparison, with everything he could have done, chose to teach then go into public service. He has taste and education behind him, his wife isn't a third trophy, he takes the high road when it comes to issues, and while he's no great orator (and gaffe prone), at least he doesn't sound like a drunk, high school dropout at a Nascar rally, and he doesn't make every single speech, conversation, interview, and policy announcement about insults and how great he is.  Trump is richer, is all.  By every other measure we might use to judge a human being, he is a total and abject failure
"
0,"Absolutely right. This protest is purely an anti-Trump protest. And did Trump really call for the NFL to fire these guys as the article says? Well... not really. He said he'd like to see an owner do that, but that isn't exactly the same as ordering, requesting, or even suggesting to an owner to do that. He was't talking to owners. I think he was just expressing, using his non-PC rhetoric, that he felt the  protests were unpatriotic and pointless. The protests are the same as flipping off the country and all it's citizens. How does that help solve the problem? What exactly is the problem being protested? And what am I supposed to do about it? We have a media that has hyped up our emotions and is dividing us by digging these things up and blowing them out of proportion.

Thus, county, city, state, federal efforts to correct issues often fail because of the generational family dynamics  (Trump has no answers beyond appealing to nostalgia) - industrial workers in the Rust Belt - coal industry; steel industry; etc. will not be coming back.  If steel, chemical, etc. do come back - technology has advanced such that employed workers will not increase.  The issue is technology; climate change; need to increase green energy.  Thus, family/education support will be the key (not destroying int'l trade agreements) - my family are rural, white - reality is that their farms exist because of federal *welfare* (which they would deny).  That welfare has been around for decades and is known as crop subsidies; crop insurance (they are actually paid to not plant at times); etc. And that crop subsidy is part of Food Stamps (both win)

There is a certain irony in the way he expects to be treated given how disrespectful of others he personally has been over the years. His birther lies about Obama being a Kenyan have come home to roost.

I know a few climate change deniers, but even they grudgingly admit that it is a reality finally.

Also the security goes beyond Trump himself.  His four children are also getting security plus their families.  So some of those costs may be for them at the moment  or split between the city and the Secret Service.

Only Anericans have a right to decide who comes into their country and who doesn't. Is it constitutional? That's for Americans to decide, not Canadians, or the French, or Germany. These countries always have the option of accepting more refugees if they feel it isn't fair. Trudeau's comments were unwise because they are easily misinterpreted. It's hard to know what Trudeau intended, since Canada has no plans to accept additional refugees. The only explanation I can think of is that anyone who found themselves stuck last weekend  in Canada while en route to the States would be allowed to remain here. This running battle between Trump and the Washington Establishment will be ongoing. Canada risks becoming collateral damage by taking sides. Our biggest asset is that everyone likes us.

0,"I agree. China could prevent the North Korean leader from precipitating the deaths of countless innocents. To think the United States is going to continue tolerating his idiotic provocations and his development of ICBM capability is foolhardy. Trump or any other President's first responsibility is to ensure the safety of American citizens. The NK threat to the US  is fast approaching critical and a pre-emptive attack on NK could occur if Kim carries out his latest plan to fire missiles close to the US base at Guam (the US military may well construe it as an actual attack and react accordingly with the blessing of their Commander-in-Chief). Kim will be solely responsible for the ensuing carnage but China will have allowed him to wreak havoc on the people of NK.

Nor can you get over the fact that it's not about winning in and of itself, but rather what is best for our country. So you trot out that old lame trope that the left can't get over not winning. What we can't """"get over"""" is the cheating in the electoral process; the gerry mandering, vote blocking & all the rest - the blatant corruption that pervades our White House and the Orange Stain that defiles it. The presidential election was stolen, not won. And we're sick of Right wing nuts doing that. Even with profound election interference, the majority of the American people voted for the person most qualified to be president and their votes were discounted. It's happened twice now and once was more than enough.

The court acted in one of two cases pending before the nine justices over Trump's travel ban, a case from Maryland brought by the ACLU, which sued to stop the ban contained in a March executive order.  The court did not act on Hawaii's challenge, which the court had also agreed to hear. That case also features a challenge to a separate 120-day refugee ban, which has not yet expired.  That case could yet be dismissed once the refugee ban expires on Oct. 24, meaning the court remains unlikely to issue a final ruling on whether the ban was lawful.  The justices were unanimous in ruling against the Maryland case.  This does not bode well for Hawaii's challenge.

0,"Donald Trump is a rookie politician and has no patience for the endless meetings and discussions about policy. He let Paul Ryan and other Republicans write the American Health Care Act with little guidance from him. By contrast, Hillary Clinton is a policy wonk and loves spending days going through the minutia of a bill. This is why she lost the election as she presented complex plans full of details.  The owner or CEO of a business calls the shots. Do what you're told or else you're fired. This is what Donald Trump is used to and why he loves signing executive orders. He is not used to opposition from others. This is why he made bizarre comments about the lack of loyalty from Democrats over the Health Care Act.  People admire Putin because he gets things done. For example, the Russian bridge to Crimea is well under way. It started in 2015 and is projected to be finished in 2019. By contrast, the Gordie Howe Bridge between Detroit and Windsor has been held up for years.

What I really liked was CNN even gave her the questions prior to a debate, and Mr. Sanders still took it all the way to the convention, no matter how much the Dems and their cohorts in the mainstream media biasedly cheated Mr. Sanders.  I don't support Bernie Sanders, but in my opinion, he was probably the most honest man in the race, I don't think his supporters will easily dismiss what the party did to him. Many Dems want to gloss over it, I don't think they can.   Also, got to love Ms. Clinton's tour. When you cheat others, and you still lose, that says a lot in my opinion!

If the Saudis don't use their new weapons against  Daesh (ISIS/IL) extremists, who will the Saudis use those weapons against?

It falls to the president to express something of the nation’s soul — grief for the lost, sympathy for the suffering, moral clarity in the midst of confusion, confidence in the unknowable purposes of God.

"
0,"When it comes to the question """"what did Donald Trump say?"""" and """"what official evidence and data do we have?"""" the journalist at least has to adhere to that objective reality. You cannot fudge the data and you cannot twist the words and deliberately mis-quote. Often times for everything there's audio or video in its ENTIRETY anyways.  Look at what Outsider said when I mentioned Trump talking about the murder rate. """"Well he could have just been talking about Chicago"""". He wasn't. He said """"in our country"""" and he's made that false claim multiple times. It is objectively not true according statistics. So either he is lying, or he is incapable of finding out truth for himself – even when faced with a correction. Either are terrifying. The journalist just connected the dots for you - look at the dots yourself, then decide if you can determine what is true. If you need Donald Trump to filter reality for you there's real trouble. He is not the arbiter of truth. Logic and reason are.

0,"Excellent point, and one that the Globe never addresses in all its ra-ra-ra articles. . It's also  my experience and that of my engineering children as well. Another part of the problem is that Canadian firms aren't willing to mentor or train new engineers. That's one reason why my son left for the US and now he'll probably never come back, unless Trump decides to kick out all Canadian engineers, even those with patents and graduate degrees and a wealth of job experience. A good engineering degree shows you have the aptitude to learn but doesn't in itself automatically equip  you for particular positions without any mentoring

Any reputable journal would have banned Clark as a commentor because of that behaviour.

He should have included the Public Option rather than drop it because a few conservative Democrats were up for election.  They either did not run or lost anyway.   Democrats have never been a congressional party to fall in line when in the majority (their minority behavior is different), although they did do a good job in unifying around the stimulus plan, which was inadequate because they needed at least one Republican (they got three).  Obama did get his way on taxes at the end of his first term and did successfully play chicken on the debt limit, both very important.  Twice he got the GOP to abandon the Hastert rule - no small feat.  He also survived a racist GOP opposition without doing what Trump would likely do with similar opposition.  These will be considered the golden years.

Even American media portrays Canada in a positive note. Trump has done and said so many outrageous things that to let Canada really have and the resulting shrieking coming from north of the border might result in more hysterical outrage from his critics. To think that Canada has an iota of leverage in a trade war with Donald Trump is absurd. Juvenile at best. The 'intertwined' economies could be untangled in many cases by moving all the parts. Threatening or complaining or acting smug  to someone with no diplomatic skills, needs no friends, plays dirty, has an ego too large to govern, thinks business is a blood sport and needs every opportunity to make good on his campaign promises given the pressure he's under may not work.

Hello?  Seriously, hello?  Why is THE PRESS providing fuel to extremists that there is a war with Islam gong on? Hypocrisy,  much?  Trump's travel ban is NOT a blanket """"on citizens from Muslim majority countries"""": The vast majority of Muslim-majority countries are not on his small list. His ban is on countries identified during the Obama adminstration as posing high risks.

0,"You're right. It should have been reported to the FBI immediately. Remember what happened when a high level Gore campaign staffer opened an unsolicited package and discovered that it contained a binder of Bush debate preparation materials — he resealed the package, delivered it to the FBI, and immediately quit the campaign so that there would be no possible taint from the receipt of stolen materials. That action by the Gore staffer illustrates the high end of the ethical spectrum; """"I love it"""" is the bottom of the ethical spectrum.  The fact that the meeting happened and that it was denied so many times by the Trump campaign means that Trump, Jr., Kushner, and Manafort could easily have been blackmail targets (the same vulnerability Flynn had, which was reported to the White House by Sally Yates).

Trump told one associate he missed his old life in New York. And he’s become increasingly focused on the prospect of losing support among his core supporters — the voters he once said would stick with him even if he shot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue.  “I don’t think it’s a worry or a concern as much as it’s a reality,” Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to the president, said of Trump’s preoccupation with his base. “It’s a reality that he understands politically.”  Polls show Trump losing a bit of ground with some of his core constituencies. A Fox News survey released last week put Trump’s overall approval rating at 31 percent, and notably cited a 7 percentage point drop among conservatives and a 9 point drop among whites without a college degree, one of Trump’s strongest voting groups…

The New York Times reported that the commencement program from 1968 does not list Trump as having graduated with honors of any kind. And a 1985 biography confirmed that he was not among the honor students in 1968. Biographer Gwenda Blair wrote that Trump was admitted into Wharton mainly due to an interview with an admissions officer who was friends with """"Freddy"""", Donald’s older brother. Many have also speculated that his father’s prestigious status played a major part in Trump’s acceptance into the university. A graduate of the class of 1968 told  the Daily News, “He was not first in the class. He was not known on campus for any reason at all.” Obviously, Trump has some kind of genius for creating an image through the use of social media and other means (lies, exaggeration, half-truths etc), but to suggest he had a prestigious academic career is just wrong.

It was so hard to do especially since my son was with one of him all the way to the helicopter and my son, as his Sgt. felt responsible because he thought he had failed him in some way. I also think that everything General Kelly said, from the VERY beginning to the end when he left the podium is something people should hear, in its entirety, before criticizing Kelly or Trump. My son told me the same thing that I should remember if he was killed there. Guess that is standard Marine line but very true too. If you heard what Kelly said that was in reference to his other experience with the same Congresswoman, it makes sense that people are angry at her for using a death AGAIN politically. Trump might have been better to have his wife call the fallen man's wife. Next time he should stick to a letter.

If you can't perceive the difference between our actions in Iraq during the W. Bush administration, and our actions in Libya during the Obama administration, then you are deluded.  What happened in Benghazi had nothing to do with Clinton, and everything to do with Congress failing to fund embassy physical security.  Within 48 hours of the Benghazi attack, 3 other embassies also came under serious attacks (Tunis, Cairo and Sanaa).  The difference in outcome can be chalked up to the other embassies all occupying modern, hardened facilities, while the Benghazi consulate was on a decades long waiting list for security upgrades.  Clinton has flaws, but I have little doubt that from a foreign policy standpoint, a Trump presidency would end up making W. Bush look like a military genius.

There is only one China and that has been adhered to by all the Presidents since Nixon, both Republican and Democratic.

Trump also continues to try and distract his mistakes by tweeting about other things like Saturday Night Live, He needs to get up to speed and take his position seriously before he causes a major international incident.

I have watched as woman have been continuously humiliated and now will be robbed of their birth right to govern their own bodies.  I have been dismayed and sickened to witness the un-Christian turning their backs on desperate refugees and Mexicans.  I have been disgusted to see how Trump has used his candidacy to enrich himself at all cost.  My patriotism has withered as I saw the head of the FBI put his personal career ahead of this nation's best interest and rules of governance.  It is time to secede.  Leave the red states to close themselves off from the world, protected from immigrants, gays and lesbians and liberals, but no rule of law.  I am happy and proud to be a part of a new nation that holds dear freedom, liberty. sound governance and democratic principles.

No electricity, no clean water for days, cell towers and repair sources all gone.  We know, from reliable media coverage of the disaster, that it was Trump et. al who utilized extreme neglect and denial that left the island to rot.  We now know that you participate in that sin.

Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near."""" - Sunzi - The Art of War.

Still, what should we expect from another feckless GOP Chicken Hawk who knows what's best for the military yet used 6 deferments to avoid serving during the Vietnam War.  Trump is clearly pandering to his evangelical base.   To firm up their support and the alt-right/racist groups that adore him, I predict he will next demand that all gay men and lesbians be kicked-out of the military.   Then it will be women need to go.   And just to assure the purity of the U.S. military once more, African-Americans and anyone not wearing a cross along with their dog tags (i.e. Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists,  etc.) will not be wanted anymore.

This article to me reads: Trump supporters plan meeting that is interrupted by non-Trump supporters. In fact, that one sentence summarizes the whole event.

With such security that Hillary would win, they feared no repercussions to violating laws to seal the fate of our country. But, an unexpected twist, Hillary lost. Trump initially back peddled to pursue this actually thinking he could keep Comey and make friendly with the DEEP STATE.. A bit naïve but after months of factless investigation and many attempts to find the evidence it so desired, the Democrats fail to produce fact out of fiction. We all know who leaked Hillary's horrible emails so the public could see her true nasty cheating self. That man is dead but his legacy will be honored and the truth will finally come out.  All the bantering about Trump White House bickering or Scaramucci remarks are nothing compared to a Presidential attempt to influence an election and a political party willing to cheat for a win!

0,"Clinton had the vast majority of the big donors and the media on her side in this election. She had every possible advantage, including endorsements from some Republican establishment types. Most of the media coverage of Trump I have seen was almost relentlessly negative and over the top. The allegation about the Russian interference was made by a top Clinton campaign official almost as soon as the e-mail leaks began, presumably mainly to deflect attention from the e-mails themselves. So, this allegation was made and emphasized by the Clinton campaign during the election and was known to the voters well before the vote. The idea that this election, despite Clinton's many advantages and all the support she received from most of the media and the big donors, was lost because the voters were made aware of some e-mails seems like a form of denial and a way for Clinton and her campaign officials to explain themselves in front of their donors and avoid some thorough self-assessment.

I feel that conservatives want to contribute too little in taxes when humanitarian programs (like welfare and SSD/SSI) need more support.  You think that liberals are self-serving and greedy because they want more taxes (which you mistakenly believe liberals get to keep).  I think that many conservatives are self-serving and greedy because they want the rich to get richer while everyone else suffers.

For Americans, we can see the disaster that is unfolding now where policies are being unfolded through twitter. Even in a flawed system like the election of the American President it should have been easy to choose between Hillary and Trump but  age old sexism and prejudice and ignorance led to Trump.

0,"President Trump needs to learn a hard lesson from former President George W Bush about intelligence agencies and their reliability under Democrat Administrations.   In 2001 when Bush took office, he kept the Clinton Intelligence leadership and all the Clinton appointees in the CIA and NSA intact.  These were the brilliant guys under President Clinton that told us there were WMDs in Iraq in 1997.   And they missed the 9/11 terrorists despite repeated warnings.  They also created the Benghazi cover story about a anti jihadist video and  spontaneous demonstration causing the deaths of the four Americans.  The  CIA Director now holds press briefings on Trump,  Really now?   President Trump needs to clean house of these political hacks in the CIA, NSA, and FBI including all the appointed deputies as well within a year and put some people in there who are not political hacks but professionals he can rely on for valid intelligence he can trust.  There is  just speculation packaged as proof.

0,"Mr. Galt: I think it's fair to describe Mr. Johnson's letter as """"mean spirited"""".  I wouldn't use the term """"ignorant""""...I think fits of anger tend to cloud one's judgment and you take actions which you later regret.  I usually write a letter, hold on to it a while, read it over, then decide to send it or not.  I'm guessing had Mr. Johnson done so, he would not have sent this letter.  I have offered my opinion that Mr. Trump is a sociopath.  I don't mean that in a """"mean-spirited"""" way.  I seriously worry that having such a disturbed man is president is a threat to our country.  I think other liberals have expressed similar feelings.  That doesn't mean we're """"sissies"""" nor does it mean we're nasty.  It means we're concerned about the welfare of our country.

These things don't rig a national election.    Anyone of finds these kinds of things unusual in a campaign, is completely naive' when it comes to the history of American elections and the types of tools that campaigns use to win.  Are push polls 'rigging', they are clearly and obviously filled with biased questions that have nothing to do with real polling.

0,"At the very least, the """"constituionality"""" of DACA has not been fully addressed.  Apparently, lower courts have said Obama exceeded his authority in enacting DACA, but the Supreme Court hasn't put the issued to bed.  So, Sessions, Trump and Huckabee Sanders are lying (once again) when they say they were under legal pressure of some sort doe to a crisis borne of constitutional violation.  They need to quit doing that (lying or exaggerating) to justify their actions.  It completely undermines the credibility of the Office of President.  To me, Trump should just say that he doesn't want DACA to continue as an executive order, and wants Conress to settle it one way or the other, instead of suggesting he HAD to act.  He didn't.  DACA, and abiding by it, was always just a matter of Presidential preference and choice.  I note that historically, Congress has always had the authority to grant citizenship, and special immigration status to both individuals and groups.  So, this is politics.

'Fake News' began with Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show', but in the last campaign ALL news decided that it wanted in on the joke. Tellingly, Jon Stewart, arguably the guy who made fake news popular, now comes off as an angry, critical, bitter crank, in his recent television appearances.

My actual point was focusing on the fact that Trump has done nothing to promote growth in the US economy and is riding Obama's economic coattails.

0,"As far as Mulroney was concerned, the big problem was corruption and Ministers being forced to resign, not fractions in the Conservative Party. The Liberal Party under Chretien was also solid until Paul Martin started his push to become leader and PM and split the party right up the middle. The CPC under Harper was ruled with an iron rod and no dissension was possible. Only Brent Rathgaber and Jim Prentice left the party, the rest applauded anything that Harper proposed. Trump's situation is far different from any of those governments, he has absolutely no political smarts and inherited a severely fractured party, he cannot succeed. Martin's failure was somewhat self-induced, he should never have split the party and he should certainly not have called the Gomery Inquiry, Harper used that as an admission of guilt as did the electorate.

Roger, the stories you find so often against Trump are stories based on Donald's own statements. Every day Trump makes some gigantic blunder with statements that are so bizarre they deserve  to be refuted by the news. He turned two  presidential candidate press conferences into grand-opening ceremonies of his hotel; press conferences that were suppose to be his policy statements.  Then he faults the media for pointing out the press conference was a publicity stunt for his own edification. He made claims about his employees problems with Obamacare where he implied many many of those employees were using the ACA. Almost instantly his own manager pointed out Trump was in error as most, better than 90%, of the employees are given a company sponsored health care insurance.  Many Alaskan's have listened to his messages and found them offensive enough to vote for anyone else.

If a party of and for the rich couldn't win elections in America the GOP would not have had any presidents at all after Teddy Roosevelt - the last liberal republican president.  Yet they've won often in the century since. By having all the wealthy votes and convincing half the poor people that their problems are caused by other poor people rather than policies which unjustly favor the rich. The only difference was that Trump named those people. But the story was always the same. Do you think Reagan's 'welfare queen' was white? But Reagan and the Bushes spoke of 'welfare queens' and 'gang violence' and 'radical Islamic terrorism' . Trump just said 'Mexicans and Muslims'.  That's not a change. It means the exact same thing. It's what conservatives have always voted for. Remember we had a conservative party in South Africa too : the guys who left the National party because apartheid wasn't racist enough for them!

Anyway there is more than enough incompetence in the rest of the cabinet to do some serious damage.  Their plans are to: ignore climate change, dismantle the EPA, burn more coal, privatize education and mine the parks.  That's what they have said, no need to blame the media there.  I do have confidence in Mattis and Tillerson and it does look like Trump has burned his fingers in the foreign policy dept enough times to lay off for a while.  But you can never count on anything with him.  The Qatar situation was a fiasco, and there is still the fear that the competents who aren't there for the sake of raw ambition will get fed up and quit.  Notably, Tillerson.

There are always details and surprises like Hurricane Harvey, but the basic outcome of this play was foreordained. The only thing that could have really changed it was preemptive action by actors who had the foresight, courage and leadership abilities to write a different ending.

And I get lobbying information from business organizations quoting people like the Chairman of GE opposed to Trump's trade and tax policies. We should also read what some major Health insurance companies say about fixing Obamacare rather than abandoning it. Mainly, we are not involving Congress in decision making and having hearings to consider these decisions with more care and research. Trump signs executive orders that make no sense in areas that should be considered by Congress (this was a criticism of Obama's orders).

Neither the leadership of the governments of Russia, China, Israel, Germany, and Iran, nor the leadership of companies such as ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Google, or Amazon is made up of the low-information voters who unwisely put Mr. Trump in office.  Mr. Trump is going to learn that lesson, and it is going to cost America - and its allies - dearly.  America is going to find out over the next four years that it really does matter that a country have competent leadership.  Russia, China, and Israel are going to take America's lunch money, and eat America's lunch.  The Germans and other European allies are fearful.  The Chinese, who have much to gain from weak American leadership, appear now to fear that they also have much to lose if American leadership is too weak - or entirely befuddled - as it now appears to be.  This is not going to turn out well.

The GOP attack on it transformed from a policy fight (which is silly because it was a Republican concept) to one over Obama and his race.

When Paul Ryan and his delusions of Randian Federalism showed up trying to upend Medicaid the process was complete.

Further, it's  why this increase occurred in that period even though Canadians remain adamantly opposed (78%) to the sale of high tech firms to China that impact the security of Canada and its allies and that Trudeau seems to support.  If Trudeau's preferences concerning the latter aren't having much effect, why  should you think his preferences concerning the former are key? The difference in the larger world  is the American election and Trump's  presidency in which objections to NAFTA were and are a constant theme.  It's not Canada (or Trudeau) that's making noises about abandoning Canada's economic relationship with the US, but the other way around.

About 10 years ago when it was fully subscribed, it set aside 250 MW of power for new publics.  Bainbridge will qualify for the 30-40 MW it needs from the remaining 190MW of this power (60 MW were allocated to two new publics organized since 2006, Jefferson PUD and Yakama Power). If BPA has to """"augment"""" to meet this need by law it has to acquire clean power. The business case for a """"Bainbridge Electric Board"""" utility is so strong because this power is the lowest cost long term power available in the United States. On PSE shutting its dirtiest coal plant by 2022, you know its plan is to shift that load to other Colestrip coal plants, and to natural gas.   Because Trump is unwinding the federal Clean Air requirments (and given that PSE is suing to overturn the Washington State Clean Air Act) PSE will be a majority carbon based utility for years to come.

Trump's commitments to both military budget increases and improvements in veterans treatment, his regular expressions of appreciation and praise of the military and his more muscular and selective use already of military force, and his obvious inclination not to be pushed around by America's enemies or ordered around by the corrupt and laughable UN have all combined to raise US military morale to its highest point since at least the Reagan years.

If this really is a case where he had nothing to do with it, then perhaps a resignation is in order, but on the lines of 'plagiarism' or 'lying' and not some trumped-up military insult.

0,"Does anyone have an estimate of when the ill effects of the Tier 1 system that ended in 1997 will start to be less each year? That is, when Tier 1 beneficiaries die at a faster rate than start retirement?  Hmm, looking at http://www.oregon.gov/PERS/Documents/General-Information/PERS-by-the-Numbers.pdf There are 45,000 active and inactive Tier 1 members. 23,000 are eligible to retire. That's a big percentage! But 6,000 retire (from all tiers) per year on average.  To me, then it sounds like in the next 5 years we may see most of the Tier 1 employees retire. At that point, the number of Tier 1 retirees will decrease. It may take a few years beyond that for the guaranteed deficits to not overcome the decreasing number of retirees, so within a decade the pain might start to ebb? That's a long time. Maybe we should all hope for Trump's growth stimulus on near-full employment to cause skyrocketing inflation and higher returns from investments.

They were listening to his phone calls when he was a candidate, and probably before. The media is willing to pay any price for 'any' information that makes Trump look bad, and so far they've come-up with ZERO, ZIP, NADA.  We now have the ex head of the FBI investigating, and every reporter is willing to go on the record with anonymous sources in an effort to disparage Trump.

"
0,"One of the ways that Trump attempts to justify his policy proposals is to appeal to a popular mandate that does not exist. Donald Trump is a historically unpopular politician who is actively loathed by a large segment of the population. No previous president has alienated the public as much as Trump has. And his policies, though slightly less reviled, are not well-liked by any stretch.  There’s one person we know for sure who has paid people to show up and voice a prefabricated political message: Donald Trump. In the summer of 2015, Trump arranged for actors to show up at Trump Tower and cheer and wave signs as he announced his candidacy for president, offering them $50 for their services. And, in typical Trump fashion, he tried to stiff the agency that set up his campaign launch.

Yes, the Democratic establishment is also corrupt with partisanship blinding their ability to choose because the money making machine based on hate for the other party won't let the people decide in open elections. Our political process has been hijacked and Trump won on that. He saw the party ignoring it's voting base with calls of trickle down, the rich are job creators, corporations are people. His solution? It's immigrants, terrorists, the Japanese, Chinese, fat women and female anchors who have """"blood coming out....everywhere"""". Now we could argue who is worse: Democrats or Republicans. Go ahead, it's a good distraction. And I'd mostly agree re: Democrats. The Republican party may not survive. That's social Darwinism.

0,"The question is whether that finding must have a factual basis before it is declared.  The data on terrorism in the United States consistently indicates that the threat largely lies elsewhere. Judge Robart made that point in his ruling.  Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, has arrived at a striking finding: Nationals of the seven countries singled out by Trump have killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and 2015. Trump’s action “is a response to a phantom menace.” 3 Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cuban refugees in the 1970s. Zero by Syrian refugees.  Contrary to Trump's claims Obama did not ban people from the seven listed countries. The Obama administration and Congress had previously designated them as places people couldn’t visit if they planned to participate in the U.S. visa-waiver program.

0,"Trump won and I do not think we should argue that he did not win legitimately. But it is alright to look at how close the election was and the fact that Trump lost the popular vote (and the electoral college vote was one of the closest in history) to explain why the country is so divided. First over a million more people wanted Hillary-- especially in urban areas in places in the South and Southeast and States like Pennsylvania. The fact that Trump lost the popular vote also means that you would expect that the electoral college vote was one of the closest in history (it was 46th of 58 electoral college votes in US history). This explains why both Trump and Democrats need to reach out to unite the country, but hostilities remain high.

He never held a political office of any kind of he is rather obvious. I am sure that he will catch on sooner or later. And his lies become more sneaky like the rest of the politicians out there.

1,"if trump is the president then he should be president for all the people, not just of  racists and bigots.  his statements and actions the last few days confirm that he is a racist and bigot too.   Obama was not perfect, granted, but trump he is totally imperfect.

He hits back, often, harder and, yes, lower than the hits thrown at him.  I like it about him. It's about time we had someone willing to stand up to the bullies in the media. The GOP has been too afraid of them for far too long.

0,"Interesting that you refer to Commonweal. I thought many of Douthat's criticisms overlapped with those of their recent editorial. Of course, you also poo-pooed those criticisms of the Civilta article - maybe selectively quoting articles is highlighting your OWN biases?  Hence: the article completely collapses any meaningful distinctions of persons & groups within both Evangelicalism & the Catholic right. It fails to acknowledge that many of Trump's most fervent conservative critics & opponents emerged from within this group: Russell Moore, Robert George, etc. Second, both pieces persuasively show that the arguments also undercut the moral force of papal statements on poverty, environment  I also strongly suspect that Garnett would likely side with Ross on the issue of religious liberty over the point you seek to use his article to support. He has advised the USCCB on many of the cases involving religious liberty issues (including, I believe, the contraception mandate case).

0,"An Economist writing for this newspaper predicted Trump would create negative economic woes - YUP!  The U.S. will be boycotted around the world while their middle class respond to the proposed consumption tax (BAT).  China will become the next super power as they take advantage of the U.S. paranoia.  Canada could really win since they are the last hope of friendship and a potential outside connection for the U.S. once they have abandoned all their friends.  Trudeau and our newspapers should be careful to stay silent until some of this plays out.  Best strategy for Canada is to build stronger trading partner relationships in Asia and Europe while letting the U.S. play out.

0,"The U.N. estimates that there are about 65 million refugees in the world today.  Any attempt to resettle a few refugees into the U.S. (or into Canada for that matter) isn't really going to make any difference because of the vast size of the problem.  What would make a difference is to stop creating the conditions which produce large numbers of refugees in the first place.  Trump was not in office when the conditions for producing masses of refugees came into being.  Probably the best thing he can do for refugees is to promote a wind down in the wars in the Middle East.

He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple him.

Unfortunately, the liberals won a majority they never expected and all of a sudden the election promises stood out being nothing but nice sounding statements.

Islam from the insanity of Muhammad portrayed as another prophet in the line beginning with the Jewish Adam, Abraham, Jesus, etc to create another sect based on patriarchal one god deism.  All of it created by humans plagiarized from Eastern ancient religions in many cases word for word from ancient texts.  Man Made God by Barbara G. Walker is the definitive history of the big lies.  Every human being on the planet should be required to read it.  The history of these religions is constant terror and destruction to gain wealth and power based on the big lies.

0,"This is why the Russians wanted Trump in place. It's not an issue of collusion but rather an issue of compromise. The Trumps and their colleagues have made money through the years by breaking the rules. It's bad enough that they have outright conned people out of their money in the open, but there are also financial deals that they don't want the world to know about. One reason Trump would never release tax returns. The Russians, I believe, know more details and are holding those over the heads of this administration. Faced with this confrontational message and military escalation, Trump will choose to stand down, as bullies often do. Well played Putin.

What better way to spend money reallocated from liberal universities as hotbeds of treason and disruption than on military training that will equip soldiers with useful technical skills, and on development that will sharpen America's technological leadership?  And despite all those liberal efforts, the Trump train is gathering momentum. At root, liberals are destructive and incapable of building.

All three plotted for this from the moment Kaine picked Wasserman-Shultz to be the new DNC Chair.  Sanders didn't have a stance.  The part that baffles me is, this whole deal screwed the Bernie Sanders supporters, yet the vast majority of them turned a blind eye to Hillary's cheating and justified it by claiming that that is what makes her more qualified to be President than Trump (I didn't vote for Trump).

The lack of female self esteem in being so judged despite all the build-up of a winner being rewarded with her dream come true is not true for a lot of women.  To meet this standard of female perfection, women take on strict diets that have negative effects on their bodies, over exercise and  suffer high rates of eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. The use of crash diets and laxatives is rampant. The contestants are very young and naïve and have a difficult time navigating in that world.

0,"""""Many critics believe the changes will discourage entrepreneurial activity.""""  Good lord. Is Wente seriously trying to sell trickle-down economics? Half of Canadians are working pay cheque to pay cheque; and I doubt anyone works as hard as the working poor — even without the opportunity to """"sprinkle"""" their income. David Leonhardt in the NYT yesterday recalled that the top marginal tax rate in the US in the 1960s was 91 per cent and CEOs made only 20 times as much as the average worker. What Leonhardt points out is that the effect of lowering the top marginal rate over the last 40 years to between 30 and 40 per cent has been to create incentives for greed and to entrench intergenerational inequality. If capitalism was a meritocracy, Donald Trump would be either an inmate or a homeless person.

0,"Hi TB9 - I did not mean the role was formally recognized in the US constitution, its not of course, but the first amendment is a pretty broad hint that an independent media was considered crucial by the founders to keeping the politicians in line.  I don't disagree with your characterization of much of the MSM as being self-important - it appears to be the cost of giving them that protection and unofficial role.  Where they, together with pollsters, have messed up in a number of elections lately (Conservative majority in Britain, Brexit victory, Trump victory) you can see them cowed by running face first into a brick wall of fact.  Whether they will actually learn from those experiences will take time to determine.  I don't ever expect them to lean right of center, but then I don't expect talk radio to ever lean left either.  I would appreciate a clear reporting of facts by everyone regardless of who that favors politically - and then the MSM can take apolitical stand in comments.

0,"I fail to see how this restaurant is celebrating colonial rule. Yes, the name of the restaurant and some of the items on the menu reference colonial rule. However, where does it say they are celebrating it? For example, a Holocaust museum does not celebrate the Holocaust because it contains the name in its title. Nor does it celebrate the Holocaust because it is full of pictures of gas chambers and emaciated bodies. The museum does, however, act as a point of remembrance and history. No doubt, children visit the museum and find out about the Holocaust for the first time. How many kids know about colonialism? Maybe they can learn by going to places like this restaurant/cafe.  I fail to see how the owner is celebrating or embracing colonialism. It happened and we should NEVER forget, the events shouldn’t be forgotten about and swept under the carpet.  Finally, if you don’t like it, don’t go. There are much more important things to worry about. Donald Trump, for one.

In the 1980s, The Democrats and Republicans actually worked together for the common good.  They actually socialized and communicated. There were disagreements and  bipartisan action. I remember. The nasty polarization and vilification and disinformation campaign of today that you feed into and perpetuate was created by REPUBLICANS - as I supported in my comment.   It started with Newt Gingrich and his minions in the 1990s, was accelerated with Mitch McConnell and his insistence that the Republicans only goal was not to lead, but to make Obama a one term President and Trump ramped up with attacks on the truth, fake news, the big lie(s) and disinformation.  I remember all of this because I have been a political junky ever since I grew up in D.C. in the volatile 1960s.  It is clearly the Republicans responsible for creating this toxic political climate.

0,"Well, because of who he is and because of his popular personality, I think the U.S actually does care about Prime Minister Trudeau's visits to the U.S. I will grant you, though, that a lot of the attention right now comes from the fact that Donald Trump is President.  I'd challenge the idea that they are just looking for anti-Trump fodder. Americans are dealing with a shock on their governance that most of them had not expected. It seems to me that many of them must surely be looking for evidence, hints, and signs about where this is going, and the relationship and trading structures between the countries is a good place to look.  Though, no doubt, some Americans will be looking for President Trump to somehow put Canada in its place, I think a lot more would be looking for a sign that our enduring good relationship will continue. A lot of Americans would be dismayed if Canada turned our backs on them.

Euthanasia is not being pursed through federal law - indeed, it was just legalized during a Trump presidency because assisted suicide bans are a violation of privacy rights (meaning its not up to the legislature, like gay marriage and abortion).

Unless Trump cuts interest rates drastically, we will only see exchange rates go very badly for the Cdn dollar and Chinese yuan.  If there are sweeping 'buy american' tax rules, more energy supply from the US going energy-independent, and new tariffs, we will see our dollar at 50 cents in two years.

You are advocating for LGBT laws to trump religious freedom rights. Many people of all religions and beliefs could care less what moral values or choices that others choose to follow, but many also have deeply held beliefs that they should not personally be involved. As in your examples LGBT laws will give LGBT a superiority over other classes. That is why it all must be reconciled so that photographers, bakers, counselors, etc are not forced by the government to labor for or serve any class that they have deeply held opinions and religious views against.  This is probably Minnery's opinion.

COP actually may increase capex on Surmont and to develop the Blueberry. Both assets are first class.  Surmont - even without major expansion - has a 30+year of production at $30 CoS - so it is a key part of global COP going forward. The current (and future potential) regulatory scheme in Canada won't impact the remainder of COP CDN assets to any great extent. This sale will not effect COP cash flow going forward - since FCCL net proceeds are invested in expansion there.

Expressing such an opinion is certainly NOT a display of anti-Americanism.  I feel it's extremely unfair to demonize someone as """"anti-American"""" because they express an opinion you dislike.

0,"Yes. Tillerson was one of Trump's cabinet members who lobbied Trump hard to stay in the accord. Mattis and McMaster and Kelly-- all former generals also reflected the military view on the importance of the standards set in the Paris Accords. Gary Cohn an ex Goldman guy said the same thing that the current Goldman head tweeted. All the CEO's who lobbied for staying in the accord also reflect what corporations are already doing. With all that, I think we continue to cut carbon emissions without the accord. In fact, the Paris Accord is becoming a standard that shareholders are pressing companies to adopt and will be the basis for lawsuits to be sure corporations do adhere to them-- at the least it forces companies to consider the issue carefully.

Instead of trying to establish a """"caliphate"""", a cynic could look at ISIS through another lens. Muslim extremists have ALWAYS trumpeted their quest for complete, global domination - and have also stated that it may take 100 years. What if the INTENT of ISIS was to instigate a mass exodus to allow the infiltration of like-minded Muslims (not necessarily terrorists or extremists) into Western and vulnerable countries? Looking at it from a one hundred year quest - imagine the increasing population coupling itself with the current trend of multi-party, coalition parties......can an Islamic political party with a non-threatening name be that far in the future? And with a significant slice of the population, could they one day hold the balance of power in a coalition government? And if so, what would the trade-offs be? Far-fetched? I don't think so.

0,"I think the rationale would be that sending down to Washington someone whom Trump knows, likes and respects and who also has experience and expertise in regard to aspects of the original FTA and NAFTA insofar as the bilateral US-Canada issues are concerned and someone who can be very persuasive and who can talk Trump's language as a former CEO and current business leader himself might prove very useful to getting The Donald to keep NAFTA or at least to renegotiate it in a way that maintains the US-Canada trade relationship.  ( Now if Trump had been a former bar doorman/bouncer or snow board instructor, we should send Trudeau instead of Mulroney.)  Mr. Trump has always said that he wants to make good, fair free trade deals on a bilateral basis so this might be the way things will ultimately go.  And the problems Trump has with NAFTA are almost solely with the Mexican aspect of it.  So as Martin argues, Mulroney would be a perfect negotiator to salvage the best possible deal for us.

For NATO, it's one thing to insist that other members increase their commitments (the US has been doing that for a long time), but to do so while at the same time praising an enemy of the US is appalling. Please take a second to step back and try to look at this situation objectively. Everything Trump says about Putin and Russia is glowingly positive, while his tone to the entire rest of the world is belligerent and dismissive. How can you possibly rationalize that difference? How can brown-nosing to a ruthless autocrat be compatible with being the leader of the free world?  Can you imagine Nixon having come into office saying that Khrushchev is a better leader than LBJ was? He would've been indicted for treason.

These Democratic retreads have way too much baggage in the eyes of the electoral vote college voters & will be a repeat of the Demos losing again in 2020.  the exception might be Kamala Harris, even Tulsi who is considered a military veteran, but the best chance for the Demos is a male military veteran with no skeletons in the closest, who like Obama is half Caucasian & half black but looks more Caucasian might be what the Demos need to take back the Whitehouse.   After 8 years of Obama, right now it is somewhat of a racial thing for a candidate to win the electoral college to become President of the US. Trumps policy of cracking down on illegal immigrants in the US only will strengthen this trend of maintaining white in the Whitehouse.  Maybe Kamala Harris can lighten her skin color like Beyonce & listen to country music.

0,"Two things missing from this article is:  1.  American debt is not owned entirely by Americans and 2.  Mister Trump is 70 years old and showing signs of something that is not good..  dementia, Alzeimers or the effects of a disease.  Should he resort to lowering corporate taxes, who is going to service the debt and with what.  Congress is already searching for money to build the wall which would be just the start of increasing substantially the national debt.  The center piece of this poopy cake is a huge dollop of uncertainty and stability.  International business will step back and wait for the mid-terms in two years when there may be some sanity returned to the American gov't.

0,"That reflects a problem in America-LAZY Democracy-I won't vote because ___________(fill in your excuse here)!  If you read the article, you see that many black voters failed to come out for Mrs. Clinton (as compared to Obama), who says that Obama voters would vote for her in the first place? The main thing they had in common was they were both Dems. This is the idea that all voters in a group vote the same (not necessarily true). Women were supposed to be in lock step behind her-did not really turn out to be true, many blacks and hispanics voted for Trump as well, funny how that happens. In regards to Trump receiving the same number of votes as Romney, you should check out the Red/Blue maps of the areas of this country showing the vote results, he appealed to a far wider cross section of the country than Romney did-most obvisously in MIch, Wisc., and Penn.

There is no such equivalency.  Trump continues to act like the schoolyard bully who beats someone and tells the victim that they """"made him do it.""""

They also potentially shifted the election to Trump (though we may never actually know for sure).  By the way...idiot? : )  Settle down, hos.  """"We do the same to basically every country in the world.""""  Probably not EVERY country.  Just because we do it does not make it right.  False equivalency to defend Russia and Putin.

Though I agree, if we do not somehow pressure Russia into backing down, into playing nice with others, then Putin will continue to bully and take all he wants unchallenged. A position I don't find in your thesis and one that I believe is very dangerous. But to argue that Trump would be better qualified to handle the situation is pure insanity.  When one thinks of all the disparaging remarks Trump has made, all the childish outbursts, the self serving bigotry, there is no conclusion other than to realize he is more dangerous to our future than any confrontation you are envisioning Hillary might get us into. When he promises """"the best"""" of things, when he says he's """"the greatest"""", etc, one only needs to look at his record to realize all he's good at is lying.

Today friendly fascism has again turned into unfriendly fascism. Global billionaire oligarchs and their government puppets use the fear to keep pushing their populations further to the right wing. Particularly the increasing bigoted fascism of Le Pen, Trump, Putin, and others, is serving the purpose of elitists who want their populations to think they are """"sensible"""" moderate liberal """"centrists"""" or left-of-centre """"progressives"""" all the while they keep pushing the entire world further and further to the right wing under multinational billionaire corporatists.

The accusations that the Russians influenced the US election is pure politics, played by the Obama administration.  We may take it as a given that there's cyber intrusions into the networks of political parties in every country of interest. The IT infrastructures of political parties are likely to be much easier to penetrate than government networks. But at the same time a great deal of valuable information can be obtained. In all likelihood those intrusions come from both foreign and domestic sources.  Now to the point: the public report issued by the FBI and Homeland security identified two breaches of the Democrats IT network. The report does not say what, if anything, was obtained in those breaches. The FBI and HS do not say that the election was influenced by that breach. That claim is made by the Obama administration, only.

It would make sense in that it would associate the Trump name and brand with the highest seats of government. More than that, it would require staff mobility and keep Trump hotels and other facilities booked up solid all year, at taxpayer expense. Security would have to be boosted threefold, also at public expense. Conflict of interest? Where are Trump's tax returns? He has said that for the president, there is no conflict of interest. Congressional Republicans must agree since they tried to castrate the Office of Congressional Ethics.

Barrack Obama, and presidents before him, enacted all manner of apparently illegal orders, and they did so with barely a whimper from the legal crowd. George Bush authorized the use of torture against enemies of the USA. Barrack Obama gave orders that put US citizens under mass surveillance, and summarily executed THOUSANDS of people (including innocents) with a  program of drone attacks around the globe. How could they do such things? Because both the legal elites and the American people looked the other way.  Assuming the legality of presidential orders is in question, I'd rank Barrack Obama's deadly drone attacks as being by far the most egregious violations. By comparison, Donald Trump's 90-day suspension of immigration from a few countries is very mild.

0,"I voted for Trump probably for the same reason that a lot of other people did - because of the two choices, Hillary was even worse.  The backlash he's getting, he's brought on himself.  He incites hate and anger.  He hurts people's pride, he hurts people's feelings.  He's degrading.  He's not politically polished - the same thing that we like is the same thing we dislike.  No matter what good he does, he's stung too many people and the negative comments are going to continue to fly.  I would like to see him thrive, too, but that's up to him.  He's getting the mirror treatment.

Put the shoe on the other foot. Suppose that five years ago some international fugitives sold, on the black market, all of Canada's top-secret infrastructure and engineering documents in the way of satellite technology and nuclear reactors and the Canadarm and on military defenses, giving Canada a really bad and compromising black eye. Would it be a wise move for the USA to welcome those fugitives with open arms, and their enablers, to live happily ever after in Seattle? Of course not. It would be diplomatic stupidity. It has nothing to do with courage or bravery.

Refraining from  criticizing  Trump's immigration policy albeit ideological divide, Trudeau is right and wise to respect the sovereignty of other country to decide their own immigration policy.

I don't know if it was decided that he couldn't in fact do the former under post 9/11 laws, but the latter can certainly be done by Congress. It's only a deception if he doesn't push for either, and there's still plenty of time to do that and so we don't know yet that he lied despite your desire to jump the gun.

It could be Russian corruption at the highest levels of banking and petroleum — well proven, or,  it could be US mouthing the words Democracy, but monetarily supporting authoritarians which guard the path of exploiting natural/human resources world wide.  President Trump embraces the use of power.   Expect most decisions to have positive economic consequences for business ownership.  That could translate to some trickle down to wage earners if it included support for public institutions, like schools, infrastructure, environmental protection, parks, access to medical services.  Or, it could fatten the wallet of shareholders.   I suspect the later.

The DNA may be of some middle eastern heritage, but Jewish is not a race. There are Jews who are German, Austrian, Russian, etc.

1,"Rubbish.  The entire surface area of the reservoir is 4,000 Ha, or 40 square kilometres, (20 Km  x 2 Km.) That's roughly double the surface area of the river at present. The area to be flooded represents 0.4% of Ag land in the Peace River district and 0.2% of Ag land in BC.  If that will feed 1 million, the balance of Peace River Ag land can feed almost 140 million Canadians.  Alternative energy sources? A  windmill has a 20 year lifespan. A dam's electrical generation capacity is approximately 100 years.  The Paris accord requires CO2 cuts of 30% by 2030, the transportation sector which contributes 27% of CO at present, must be electrified. The claim that we can rely on the Columbia River (USA) dam's capacity is foolish. When Trump says America First, it means everyone else last. The only energy security we can count on is our domestic supply.  Finally, blowing off about $5 billion to mothball a $9  or $10 billion project is astoundingly stupid.

0,"Canada actually has a couple of things in its favour:  1. Lower federal corporate taxes (15% vs 35%)  2. More favourable immigration policies.  There is no way those 50,000 new tech jobs can be readily staffed up in ANY North American city.  There simply isn't the talent available.  Amazon will need to bring in workers from overseas to fill a lot of these positions, and setting up a base in Canada avoids the highly restrictive US immigration system (which isn't about to get any more relaxed with Trump in office).  The only place in Canada where it makes any sense to setup something on this scale is Toronto, or nearby.  Vancouver is out of the question.  Calgary is too small and not a tech hub.  Edmonton..? Funny.  The GTA itself has several downsides, but I am wondering whether Amazon is considering K-W and the empty Blackberry buildings.

0,"There is one problem with Twitter. People believe what they want and disregard anyone who tells them different.  In Trump's case people wanted to believe that he can create jobs. On the surface he has the credentials to do so. Maybe what the US needs is a businessman, not a politician or former soldier, for president.  However, one problem with twitter, and also all social media, is that they can spread  untruths. Statements made are read and then passed on without critical review. This gives this information an aura of fact it may not deserve it. A case in point was stories on Facebook about ongoing FBI investigations into the Clinton Foundation. The FBI did investigate it but closed its books two years ago.  This is not necessarily new since it happened with print media for generations. What is different is the speed at which the information is disseminated. Maybe it is time that social media was reigned in, particularly during elections.

So why does the left want to provoke a fight between the US and Russia? It would take a fool to ignore the terrible possibilities of such a conflict. The left has a very destructive hidden agenda and now that Trump won they would actually prefer bringing on a terrible conflict than lose relevancy.  Obama and the rest of the swamp had hoped Trump was more impulsive than he is and expected to easily provoke conflict between Putin and Trump but instead the two men see through their aims and are just patiently waiting out the end of these jackals.

So how does this discussion relate unto the Trump plan of refusing immigration temporarily from seven Nations that had been deemed most dangerous by the Obama administration?  It seems unto mine own self, that this is not an issue of religion, but an issue of safety, considering the prevalent ideology within those Nations, not by the populace, nor by the religion itself, but by the number of radicals that reside therein, and have declare war upon the western world within general.  The vast majority of the populace, I am sure, does not want the violence propagated by the tiny minority, but the minority still exists, and still wants to do us harm.  Whence under a perpetual attack by persons unknown, from an area that is known, what is a Sovereign Nation, under said attack, or perceived attack, to do?  I, for one, believes that our Constitution protects us, the citizens that reside here, and those abroad, rather than others.

I wonder if she (or the bishops) would entertain a compromise to require that voucher funded schools be unionized?  If not, I hope she fails badly.  Tillerson may be an excellent deal maker, but the question is whether he can be a Department of State organization man.  More important is seeing who his Deputy is, as the Deputy runs the department, including much of the policy.  The Democrats were overconfident fools when they changed the filibuster rules.  They made their beds and now they can lie in them.  The same is true of Trump voters.

0,"There was a conflict between 1--what SCOTUS said in its order-- that inlaws were an example of a close relationship--and 2-- what the US order implementing the SCOTUS order to partially restore Trump's ban said. The order implementing the SCOTUS order uses immigration law definitions for close relationships which are an exception to the ban, but those immigration law definitions would not include in-laws. In other words, while the SCOTUS used in laws as an example of an allowed close relationship, the new DOJ order would not because it specifies definitions in the immigration laws which do not include in laws in the definitions used to enforce the order. So it makes sense to get this clarified or Dr. Eishikh's mother in law would be banned even if SCOTUS used mother-in-laws as an example of a close relationship exception to the ban.

0,"Warren Buffett has argued that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. He is one of the few 1%ers that feel this is unfair. Warren's lower tax rate is primarily due to the fact that he makes most of his income through capital gains. The middle class gets squeezed because they typically get paid through salaries and 100% of it attracts income tax.  You are correct though, if we have a higher capital gains tax than others we may see a flight of capital and people leaving Canada. So the government is wise to see how Trump's first budget looks like.  Finally if the Liberals want to address inequality they should consider making this revenue neutral. In other words increase capital gains tax but decrease the middle class tax rate. The problem is this increase looks too much like a tax grab to support campaign promises.

Maybe it could for some be called unpatriotic free speech? I can see the argument that the NFL players are on work time and so the focus is football. However, some political speech at work has been deemed constitutionally legal, like wearing a button for a candidate, as long as it does not disrupt the workflow. Others on this side will say the owners can stop this, but they aren't. Thus Trump's claim they are afraid of the players who make money for the owners. Others say kneeling IS patriotic, the freedom to do so being what the Founders fought for. I can't understand why freedom of speech is OK but not if it is disgraceful to our nation. That is the cost of freedom. No one is saying pick up a rock and destroy the country. If we're going to salute the flag at a sport event (why sports?), then those who dislike kneeling can boo later.

0,"Duterte and Trump are alike in many ways:  they've taken on jobs where they're in way over their heads, they are both impulsive, crude, lewd and rude.  That chest-thumping approach gets them a certain number of supporters, but voters (and the world) are starting to see that it doesn't get them very positive results.  In Duterte's case, the large number of indiscriminate, extrajudicial killings -- both by police and by """"death squads"""" -- is starting to reap censure from his own countrymen and from world leaders.  Inviting him to the White House is in as bad taste as inviting Anastasio Somoza would've been back at the start of the 70s.

They believe protecting the so-called rights of illegal aliens and immigrants from Muslim countries is more important than protecting American citizens. But harsh times require harsh measures. We are at war. Trump is trying to protect us from people who are our sworn enemies and have vowed to strike at us every chance they get. They hate America and everything it represents. Even though America is to blame for causing the situation, it's still disgusting to watch the political charade continuously put on by the liberal democrats. History repeats itself.

And Gaudium et Spes called it an """"unspeakable crime"""" (you don't dissent from Vatican II, do you?).

0,"Yeah, and the money made from creating all of those goods and services were profits and wages. Those profits and wages were spent on consumer goods, creating more profits and wages that were again spent on wages. And so on... That's pretty basic economics and that's why the fiscal multiplier of infrastructure spending invariably exceeds that of across the board tax cuts.  Why not choose October, 2009? That was the end of the last fiscal year before Obama's responsibility began. Just like in 2017 we're working out Trump's first budget which begins next year.  The republican problem isn't describing the problem it's their inability to resolve it. While I agree with Trump's aspiration to increase infrastructure spending he'll never get it through the supply-siders.

The Devos family is a VERY successful business family; along w/ their close friends the Van Andels (See US Chamber of Commerce).  Knowing her personally, she will definitely look for the most successful results and then go w/ that.  I don't like that it again means or is implied that top down is back in town, but really, if our schools here aren't performing to a standard, then maybe a change should be made.  I didn't even get into part of the problem being the entrenched bureaucracy prevalent in our islands.  This issue is not complex.  Teachers teach, parents parent, children should learn.  Getting into the weeds w/ a plan based on theory made up by agenda driven academics hasn't been working.  If charter schools are successful, and many of them are, then just take the best from ALL the systems, to include parochial, and MAKE STUFF HAPPEN.

Will blame you for the very things that we were doing ourselves. That will work it's a James Comey can get Mueller to head up the special Council. That way the guy who is running the FBI who buried those 30 pages of documents will be running the investigation basically putting the focus on Trump and protecting their own.

Canada being the inferior partner to this agreement is reluctant to challenge inherent unfairness. The importance of an agreement of rules, effective adjudication and respect means more to Canada. There are terms in Free Trade / NAFTA that should never have been agreed to by a nation intent on maintaining sovereignty, such as the Proportional Energy Sharing Clause. The Dispute Settlement Mechanism, rationale for the massive transfer of Canada's sovereignty, has proved inadequate.  Should Trudeau renegotiate with Trump under these conditions?
"
0,"Trump stepped away from his own rhetoric and appears to have embraced the Saudi world view - Just as Iran has ELECTED their moderate for another term.  The billions US is getting in arms sales and the reputed $100 million to Ivanka for her foundation might be helping set the childish Trump's world view.  And when he gets to Israel the hate and blame Iran will just be reinforced.  But hey - Trump got to play with a sword and was given a really gaudy necklace so - winning.  Sad!

When you set out to destroy complex policies & laws that have been in effect for years & are liked by the majority of the American people, expect opposition. The mess has been created by Trump bypassing necessary departments, not getting proposed EOs properly vetted by legal, choosing unqualified friends and donors for high visibility cabinet postions that demand expertise, etc. Trump's been trying to hustle his inept cabinet picks through the confirmation process without. proper vetting.  Add Flighty Flynn, whose poor judgement is second only to Trumps, into the mix. top it off with his disjointed 3 a.m fever dream tweets, constant lying - as well as that of Conway and Spicer on his behalf - and you have the perfect storm of a clusterfk.

0,"<<It's depressing and stressful to contemplate the church's complicity in support for Trump.>>  I was faced with this very predicament at Mass this morning.  The celebrant -- a good man, a good priest -- asserted that a Catholic could not vote for Hillary Clinton. To be fair, he did not mention Clinton's name and he did not recommend a vote for Donald Trump; but his meaning was unmistakable. I did something I haven't done in thirty years or more -- I left Mass after the homily because of the homily.  Already, I regret that I did -- and I'll probably confess it the next time I go to confession.  And I will discuss it with the priest-celebrant.  But this gets precisely to your point -- the church's ministers must find the language to promote Christian and Catholic teaching, and support the exercise of the voting franchise, without being complicit in the election of Donald Trump; indeed, without endorsing anyone.  The single issue approach fails; it leads to simplistic, false conclusions.

0,"These after hours tweets by the commander-in-chief are a kind of stream of consciousness often found in more formal analysis sessions of years ago. Unless his staff can dissuade President Trump from further use of this social media outlet for his musings and ventilating there will be more such unfortunate commentary much of it indulging in his habit of denigrating his perceived foes. The Id, Ego, and Super-Ego were described by Sigmund Freud many decades ago. Freud would be pleased with just how his observations are still relevant in our modern times.

Are their underlying sudden changes in the economy, like the exchange rate, like recessions in the other countries, etc?  We need to find a sudden change to explain the sudden drop-off. The article mentions the Trump travel ban, but without seeing the ban was only an expression of an underlying change in how the US is relating to the rest of the world and being perceived. Much of the world's population is concerned about Trump's election and what it says about American society, culture. I can see where foreign students, or their parents, might decide to make alternate plans while they wait to see what this all means.

0,"The mainstream media and comment boards are now filled with conjecture as to why this young man did what he did. From now on judging from some of the articles, the usual suspects  will be immigration, Trump, Islamaphobia, and alt-right views. Some posters have zeroed in what generally is overlooked, the actions of a deeply disturbed individual. Consider what the mindset would have to be to go out and kill indiscriminately because you are angry. Consider as well the population of Canada, and the possible number of mentally challenged individuals , and then the number of mass killings that occur. This doesn't excuse it , make it go away, or make it any less horrific. But to make the leap that all of Canada has a problem, or that all of Canada has to question whether we are racist because of the actions of one man, just isn't right. To kill people as this person did, is not the action of a normal person, most people realize this , and don't see it as a greater problem then it is.

Warren who has spent most of her adult life studying the topic.  She knows the system is rigged to appeal to passive ownership over over wage earners or for that matter consumers.  There are very identifiable reasons why the financial sector has surpassed ear industrials, rewarding the money handlers over those who directly produce products and services.   I believe both parties fear the power,or, lust for their share of passive profit taking.  I'd vote for Warren in a second.  We live in a world of economics battles and she's a warrior.

Since you on the left are constantly pointing out actual definitions when it comes to Trump, instead of using things in context and seeing the overall meaning, you cherry pick one or two words to try to make him look bad.  By the definition above, if Nieto stated that Mexico was not going to pay for the wall and Trump informed him that would be discussed at a later time, there was no discussion, just a statement by one party to the other.

It was actually a series of questions, not supportive statements. And, in fact, my own Opinion as to why so many people seem to be falling in behind him, when, as you noted, he talks one thing but has done the opposite at some point. Also note, I made no mention of changing the 'system'. You want change in the 'system'? Until such time as the American Sheeple impose term-limits on the Royal Elite reigning in Washington, 'change' will be what you have left in your pocket after Big Gub'ment is done fleecing you.  Oh, and by the way... unfortunately, I'm starting to think that a vast majority of Americans actually *do* just want a tweet that sounds good, rather than real progress as a nation.

Business investment, as the Conservative opposition has repeatedly said, is being stymied by the Liberal government raising business costs with higher taxes and their socialist lite threats to raise taxes on the rich. These weren’t acted on in this budget but the continued warnings from Morneau raise business anxieties. It would have been better to get all such measures implemented in the first budget, so the business community knew what kind of business environment they would have to operate in. And now the Trudeau government’s grossly irresponsible refugee policies are threatening to thicken the border between Canada and the US when the Trump regime inevitably responds. That must be another disincentive for businesses to invest in this country.

0,"POTUS  has the authority to deem whatever is necessary to insure the safety of the American people. This includes vetting non-citizens of the US.  Other countries would do the same.  The Trump administration rushed to judgment  and didn't use the prose while vetting those of non-citizen/visa origin. The initial result at the airport held certain individuals for awhile, then were released after proper vetting. They were not detained or sent back to their country of origin unless suspected of being a security threat.  Watson & the Left-wing media are utilizing clips from POTUS campaign to justify their argument in Trumps excluding 'muslims' and certain ethnic groups. Not rule of law.  What would Inspector Clouseau say about Watson ?

0,"People criticizing Jeff Sessions are ignoring one thing: Donald Trump isn't angry at Jeff Sessions over expansion of the war on drugs or property seizures. Donald Trump is angry at Jeff Sessions because Jeff Sessions isn't displaying enough personal loyalty to Donald Trump, in Trump's opinion. Trump is angry at Sessions for not making the Russia investigation disappear. Trump wants absolute loyalty to Trump. Regardless of a cabinet department head's duties, responsibility to congressional mandates in its founding documents, ethics codes, etc. That's what this columnist is appalled by. Jeff Sessions' policy decisions aren't what upsets Trump. Trump wants Sessions to be a lackey. Just like the new press secretary. Trump wants to hear: No one has attacked the USA today because foreign leaders are awed by Trump. Rain showers occurred in the East today because of Trump's magnificence. The sun will  be eclipsed by Trump's greatness on August 21. The world revolves around Trump, not the sun.

Current Secretary of State John Kerry was interviewed today and said that Trump has not been briefed at all by the State Department nor has he asked for any briefings.  It seems that bluster and bombast are going to carry the day in foreign relations over the next four to eight years.   What self-respecting individual (whether it be Romney, Petraeus (who would be a bad fit for a diplomatic post) or, lately, John Huntsman want to serve in that position.  If Trump wants bluster and bombast rather than reasoned diplomatic overtures from his Secretary of State he might as well choose Rudolph Guiliani for the job.  Trump would get his money's worth in bluster and bombast from that character.  He might start a war or two or three but as long as you offend people and countries, what's the problem?

It says he has “demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding” of the nation’s “vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values” on which American policy should be based.

Nevertheless, hundreds of thousands of Americans have been marching in Washington, DC against U.S. president Trump and his ideas but that won't get rid of Trump.  If some Americans don't like Trump and his ways and ideas, instead of marching and protesting against Trump, maybe those Americans should be marching and protesting against the electoral college system that put Trump into power.

As stated by the U.S. Supreme Court:  """"[W]e recognize that an agency’s refusal to institute proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch not to indict—a decision which has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is the Executive who is charged by the Constitution to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”""""

Nobody suggest that Bill Belicheck takes over the reins of the Yankees.

But it will have little effect on illegal immigration between Mexico and the US, and it will come at a high cost. The cost to build the wall is no big deal for the US, but it's the cost to police it that will skyrocket.  The US has something like 20,000 border security agents currently patrolling the US-Mexico border, along with a whole lot of other security infrastructure. They estimate that they have about 200km of the 3000km border fully secured. That's right- about 1/15th of it. Building a wall or fence has little effect unless you have people patrolling it as well.

I just hope they are paid trolls to support Trump or more attempts to influence by Russians because if this is honest-to-god disregard of the ramifications involved it is actually scary.

Other mayors like Bill diBlasio of NYC take notice and  do their best to curb any change that will cause them the same problems.( He supports pre K which the unions like but forgets any advantage is lost when the children are forces into substandard K-12 schools)That pretty much leaves it to the GOP to propose innovative ideas. Some will be good , some not- but trying them is important. Currently the US spends more per pupil than all but one OEDC nation with poor to mediocre results. Some of the worst performing school districts, like NYC and DC, spending per pupil is far above the national average.

It is in China’s best interest to do so.

Trudeau has always been steady ,no one has ever needed to ask where he stood, In fact  he gave a very impassioned speech during the time that the Conservatives were riding their niqab wave and Mulcair was equivocating in an attempt to hang on to his nationalist Quebec votes.  Trudeau was attacked for making some very pertinent observations as he went against the current of anti Muslim  sentiment that was being whipped up by Kenney and the Conservatives.

0,"I don't believe that all immigrants are peace-loving, but I KNOW not all US citizens are peace loving. By far the largest number of our terrorists are home-grown. Starting with the Texas Tower sniper Charles Whitman who killed 14 and wounded 31 more in 1966, most of our terrorists have been white male citizens with guns and bombs. Anti-American hatred among Muslims is at least matched by anti-Muslim hatred by American citizens. And remember, since 2003 we have killed a million Muslims in their own countries.  We vet our immigrants and refugees very strictly. We can't weed out the bad ones entirely, but I believe that those seeking refuge and a better life in the US are good people looking for a better life for themselves and their children, and willing to work for it.  Iran's leaders shout """"Death to the USA"""" mostly to set up a villain for their ignorant starving masses to blame for their problems. In much the same way, Donald J. Trump demonized certain groups, and won the presidency.

0,"Trump to take break from rage-tweeting the NFL for visit to a devastated Puerto Rico  This announcement comes just hours after Twitler sent out a series of tweets blaming Puerto Rico and the ocean for its problems.  Traitorous Trump could have ordered the armed forces to conduct an emergency air evacuation of the island, moving hundreds of thousands of the most directly threatened to safety.  He didn’t.  The people of Puerto Rico are suffering, and it took days of public shaming for someone in the White House to finally schedule a visit as Trump has made his racist attacks on athletes his main priority on Twitter.   It’s more than safe to assume many Americans in Puerto Rico would much rather see an Air Force One full of supplies and food rather than one full of Trumps.

Anyone who was expecting something different either wasn't paying attention or believed Trump.  The ongoing farce of the Trump presidency continues apace.

Sadly, bluster and bravado are his only tools. The situation is unsustainable, but while it lurches through it's short life cycle, one can only marvel at how low the institution of the presidency has fallen.

His innovation is not lying, of course; that’s a tactic as old as politics. Rather, it is his instinctive sense that the truth has become immaterial, coupled with his own agnosticism on the issue -- thestar.com Call me old fashioned but truth matters in both politics and religion.

Would it be possible to investigate him, bring charges, and take him to court in that case or could he theoretically stop the process every time until his term is up?  My suspicion is that even if that would work what would eventually happen is impeachment and if he's successfully impeached then he's no longer president and then at that point he would no longer have the power to fire the investigators making it possible only then to bring the case.

He doesn't take the money that Clinton and Durkin take. His record and ethics are outstanding. How dare you make up this garbage.

Putin would like nothing more than to restore the Soviet Union and anything else he can get his hands on. With Trump's policy of Russian appeasement, he may well get his wish. That's not just bad for Europe, but very bad for the U.S. and the rest of the world. The money we pay isn't just for Europe's security it's primarily for ours. He cannot be allowed to do this.

0,"This entire episode is moving along a time line and what was true a day ago may not be true a day later.   Comey is not a soothsayer; therefore, even he wanted, he could not have implied that his statement to the President regarding his (Trump's) status as not being an object of any investigation would be true at all time in the future.   Comey's statement should never have been used as evidence of total exoneration.  Also remember as with Nixon (who resigned) and Clinton (who was impeached) neither would have had serious  problems with the original circumstances.  What tripped them both was the credible appearance of obstruction of justice which seems to be the bane of the egotistical.  Lastly, impeachment is a political process much more than a judicial process and absent that political will to impeach,  it will not happen.

0,"This article pretty much sums up what's going on with this and Trumps response.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/11/intelligence-agencies-cia-donald-trump-russia?  The best line in the story is this:  """"“There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match,”   “If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths,”  Clearly a frightening prospect when you have a president elect who is that vain
