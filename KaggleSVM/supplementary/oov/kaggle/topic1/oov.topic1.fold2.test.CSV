0,"Wow. The Caucasians mentioned six time in one paragraph. Do you have a problem with race?  President Trump's people knew how to get the job done. Similar to Obama's people getting the nobody elected after one speech. Eight great years ahead. Stock market, gold and oil all up again.

0,"The specific purpose of the """"checks and balances"""" built into the Constitution is to curtail """"over-reach"""" by a governmental entity.....legislative, executive or judicial.  The Supreme Court (and by extention, lower Courts) established the concept of """"judicial review"""" with Marbury v Madison and that concept has been reinforced and validated by hundreds of precedents over the last two hundred years.  You're displeased with the Courts' findings regarding Trump's immigration Presidential Order and blame it on partisan politics...thereby, asserting that the Judges involved violated their Oath of Office.  You parrot the same accusations made by Trump.  He claims, each and every time something doesn't """"go his way"""", that someone is """"out to get him"""", that """"he's being treated unfairly"""", and """"he's the victim.""""  We do have three distinct branches of government at the federal level.  Each has powers, duties and responsibilities.  Each has, among those powers, duties and responsibilities, (cont)

0,"As of the moment the only good news for the U/O is that Coach Helfrich and Duck football doesn’t nearly s^^k as much as U/O President Schill and the current campus kindergarten of Trump~o~phoboes.  Progressive liberals are among the most gullible, duped, uninformed, unknowledgeable used political tools on the face of the planet, or whatever planet they’re orbiting at the moment.  The unfounded hysteria, and playing of the hyperbole mega victim card by U/O students is beyond silly. It most certainly reveals a serious lack of intellectual judgment and reflects rather negatively upon the O/U as an institution of higher learning.  After Schill signed on the """"Blackface"""" letter condemning the law professor which in effect says """" your first Amendment rights does not matter"""". I and I'm sure others, feel Mr. Schill's U/O employment no longer matters. Please Mr. Schill don't let the door hit you on the way out, as the U/O can do a lot better without that kind of anti-American garbage.

0,"Well Trudeau out overran Harper with 10 years of experience and Obama appointed MIT nuclear physicist and a guy who won a Nobel Prize, to head the Department of Energy ( responsible for 7,000 nuclear weapons) while Trump appointed Rick Perry.  Enough said?
"
0,"President Trump is """"upset"""" that Flynn's illegal discussions with Russian officials were leaked to the media.  Trump knew on January 26th that Flynn had, in fact, discussed US sanctions with Russian government officials.  It's likely that Flynn could have been prosecuted (and might still be prosecuted)  for violation of the Logan Act which makes it illegal for civilians to interfere in diplomatic relations.  Trump gambled that Flynn's actions would not be exposed and he could remain Trump's national security advisor.  The exposure of his actions made that impossible.  IMO, Trump is guilty of failure to disclose his knowledge of illegal behavior and choosing, instead, to engage in an unsuccessful cover-up.  He's angry....not at Flynn, but at """"intelligence officials"""" who leaked the information and the media for publishing it.  Those damn people just refuse to keep illegal actons secret...what's wrong with them anyway?  Gary Crum

0,"Geezus . . . so three women are dead and you're blaming WOMEN? The """"treatment"""" of everyone is utterly demeaning in our society, with the exception of a few rich, powerful white men--Weinstein, Spacey, Trump, Roy Moore, etc.--who have license to demean and degrade almost everyone else.
"
0,"Good point. One big problem is the various news aggregation sites - a collection of headlines. Driven by trend rather than importance and context.  That being said, it is a positive they are interested. Personally, I discuss with my kids  the critical value of good journalism, investigative reporting, and analysis. Not that easy to find in a sea of information and misinformation, with the tides of that sea increasing """"personalized"""".  That being on top of the latest nonsense from the lips or fingertips of Donald Trump is really not the same as understanding an issue.  During the election, we had quite a few discussions. I said pay less attention to the proliferation of headlines and op eds decrying the buffoonery, start to dig down on what makes him attractive. Read about the US economic trends over the decades. Understand the opioid crisis. Consider what is means to feel neglected and mocked. Then you will know have a better recognition Trump is a symptom not the causal agent.
"
1,"As I read all these thoughts about trump or his ideas being hateful,angry,a pschotic lier etc.You people should be smart enough to realize trump is not a politician. Nor does he espouse  any particular idealogy.He is a  pragmatist who seeks solutions based on reality. I have respect for any transgender persons .But the military is not a good place to take his or her gender confusion.They cannot be defending this country while having sex change operations.

0,"By doing what?  You think the USA is an ally?   Since NAFTA they have plundered Canada, broken the agreement scores of times and lost all but one or two of their appeals under arbitration.  Now the Trump thump.  Where do you get your ideas?!  There could be whatever joint IP agreement amongst these countries as our imaginations could put together.  Do you not think that these other countries could quickly catch up and pass the USA in regard to communication technology if we took the initiative?  Why have we abandoned that field to the USA???   In fact many of their experts are stolen from Canada, Europe and Asia.  The USA education process and standard is the same as it was when they stole Eurasian rocket experts in 1945.  As one American leader said, """"We disparage the kinds of education that makes our cities and weapons while bowing to the kinds that lead to dependency like philosophy.  As a result we have neither pipes nor theories that hold water.  You worship the wrong idol !
"
0,"If Trump were a D&D aligned character: Chaotic Evil A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do. He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.  Not a serious statement, just trying to figure out a good analogy for Trump and company.
"
0,"In theory I agree with you, but globalization and the decline of organized labor has been devastating for the working class. Obama's vision was for government to invest in new industries that would create new kinds of jobs that could not be exported overseas, but that is a long-term initiative and as we know Obama met with a great deal of obstructionism for purely political purposes.  Trump promised easy panaceas because he is massively ignorant. Remember when he was going to get rid of NAFTA? You don't hear his apologists breathe a word about dialing back that flashy vow. Trump has withdrawn the US from the TPP, which obviously a lot of lefties opposed as well, but as problematic at the TPP is, I think that was a mistake. Trump relinquished US power to determine trade relations in the Pacific. A huge concession.
"
0,"If you want a simple explanation for Trump's admiration for murderers like Duterte, then just follow the money.  In Manila the Trump Organization is about to open a $150 million, 57-story skyscraper. It's a licensing deal worth millions.  The developer of that property, Jose E. B. Antonio, was recently named a trade envoy to the U.S.  Trump also has deals in Turkey, hence his admiration for their autocrat, Edrogan.  It's quite simple, really. Trump's foreign policies will all have a common thread. Use of the power of the presidency to enrich the Trump clan.
"
0,"Trump's choice of words is certainly inappropriate for a man who always has the 'nuclear football' within arm's reach.
"
0,"Nope.  I'm somewhere in the middle and I can tell Trump is a disaster.  So can most of my conservative friends.  As for his """"relentless pounding"""" -- he's earned every bit of it with repeated lies and the appointment of complete incompetents like Conway, de Vos, and the Flynn fiasco.  He has the king of fake news, Steve Bannon, sitting in on more national security briefings than members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- as if he has any security credentials.  His first major initiative, the Executive Order about immigration, was sunk by the courts -- and then he calls them """"bad"""" courts and a """"so-called judge.""""  He has had time to settle in; he's just made a spectacular mess of settling in.

1,"While I do not like Donald Trump, Ms. Clinton also has a checkered past as well as saying many ridiculous statements over the years.  Too bad Ms. Streep fails to acknowledge her favorite candidate has many faults.  Anyway, while I respect free speech,  Ms. Streep's comments at the  Golden Globe Awards were not appropriate.
"
0,"Are the USCCB bishops and the pastors who told their people they had to vote for Trump because he was """"pro-life"""" going to step forward now and apologize? Are they going to tell people what real Church teaching is (the seamless garment of life issues) and not just dead unborn babies...anti-war, protection of life from womb to tomb.. my, 60 missiles launched against a civilian population, after you warn the Russians and the Syrian military so they can get out of the way, just doesn't sound very pro-life to me. Where is the outrage from our Church leadership in this country?
"
1,"What a hypocrite!  Trump will do anything to help his friends make money, without regard for anything or anyone else.  In the meantime, his golf course in scotland has applied to build a sea wall to protect against rising sea levels due to climate change!!!  The vindictive, childish clown has also built a wall on the border of his golf course, blocking the sea view of his neighbors who refused to sell their homes to him.  He then had the bill for the work sent to the residents, who promptly threw it into the trash.  They then began flying the mexican flag whenever he visited his golf course to symbolize their refusal to pay for his wall.  In a further display of his contemptible lack of class, he publicly accused one resident of living """"like a pig,"""" and calling him a """"disgrace"""" for not selling his """"disgusting"""" and """"slumlike"""" home.  Residents related that he won public approval for his golf course with grand promises, then broke them one by one.  Sound familiar?

0,"It is clear that Canada is at the beginning stages of an economic crisis driven by bad demographics. Improve them, or cut services to the elderly. We need economic immigrants very badly and should be advertising aggressively in target countries where the right skills are present and there are better prospects for integration (ie speak English/French). The cost of not acting is far higher than those associated with integration challenges. As an example, we should aggressively target knowledge workers in liberal US states that hate Trump - surely we can bag a few of those? And Brits that are frightened by Brexit - scoop up a few of them too. Hong Kongers fearful of mainland integration - them too.

0,"Illegal immigration is down, NATO  partners are increasing their share of cost, jobs are returning to the u.s., economy is moving along well, supreme Court Justice in place, isis on the run, withdrawl from ttp, renegotiating nafta.  While Trump has thus far failed legislatively he has accomplished what others before him where unable or unwilling to do.  It is near curtain that Hillary would have done nothing with NATO funding imbalance, nafta, illegal immigration and decline in u.s. manufacturing base.

0,"One starts to wonder whether Trump was in collusion with Russia from the start.  Given his history, would you put it past him?  """"We want to make sure we brief Congress and relevant stakeholders, like possibly state administrators who actually operationalize the elections,""""  And this is exactly what you're referring to - using the electoral college to make the necessary course correction.

1,"Lisa's sycophancy and stooging for Trump is the subject at hand.  The most recent public process resulted in the recommendation that the entirety of ANWR be placed under wilderness designation.  That process ended just last year.  Trump wants to undo that by decree and Lisa, being the stooge she is,  ...goes along with Trump and leaves the public hanging out in the wind.  Hater?  Since when is acknowledging reality defined as being a hater?  Or are you one of the unprincipled who approves of the crimes of Trump?  You like America represented on the world stage by adulterers, incompetents and crooks?  Trump's a traitor and if Lisa supports the traitor, she's no better than a common traitor.

1,"The anti-Trump media says it is 'not quite the truth'. But ask yourself, if it was not true, why did they prevaricate with 'not quite'? It's because they are liars.
"
0,"Even with some reality-based revisions, millions of Americans will be left uninsured as a result of this latest iteration of the GOP health care bill, and it will profoundly reduce Medicaid benefits in the years ahead. A health care bill in which participation is not universal, important funding to support it is relinquished by giving up tax revenue and where states can change the terms of insurance with little substantiation will leave many without coverage. Those who would most suffer most are those needing long-term care such as the elderly. This GOP replacement of Obamacare, a core campaign promise of President Trump, still appears to be a solution in search of a problem.
"
1,"These protests are entirely legal, and protected by the first Amendment. However, as a US Army combat veteran, I find them insulting and despicable. If you hate Trump enough to demean the service and sacrifice of millions of Americans, you are sadly pathological and ignorant. And please understand this: these are ALL about Trump, as inequality has been around forever. It's like the sudden discovery of statues of Confederate War soldiers...many were there for well over a century, but SUDDENLY they were an affront!! They must come down! Because we hate Trump [and Trump voters].  The hypocrisy is truly mind boggling. Ignorant, blind hatred wins over respect.

0,"The GM is now towing the US MSM desperation line - doubling down on the completely discredited Russian blame game. The MSM is now one massive joke - who buys a newspaper anymore?...The propaganda cul de sac has reached its apex - and the real comments here demonstrate that Canadian presstitutes are unable to fool anyone. The real story is what has happened in Syria with the liberation of Aleppo - the oligarchs who pay these stooges are desperate to obfuscate or at least blur the shocking reality that not only has the destruction of ME civil society been rolled back but soon Trump will be the POTUS. Trumps ascent to power will bring far worse consequences to the western oligarchs than Putin's cleaning of the Russia House in the early 2000's.
"
0,"Did I respond to you? This is the wrong fake news. The real fake news is that the Russians planted this rumor and murdered him to cover their tracks. Other fake news is that he was an agent for Russia and a Trump plant in the DNC to sabotage the DNC by leaking information. Another fake news site says he was killed by the Dark State Clinton/Obama CIA to pin this on the Russians. And finally, rumors and fake news: The investigator is employed by Fox News. He claims to represent the family and will only release the """"evidence"""" to them, but family says they never hired him. So more fake news to pick from.

There is nothing in the constitution that states foreigners have a constitutional right in our country!  This right is reserved only for  US citizens.

1,"Two supposedly educated individuals spewing such drivel is mind boggling.  Burney should just keep enjoying his retirement and keep quiet as he has nothing to add to the discussion. What's more surprising is how Canadians, who generally seem to pride themselves on being different from their US counterparts, are rooting for the disaster that is Trump. Actually, the bigger problem is that Canadians are just as uninformed and ignorant as the majority of Americans tend to be, judging by these uninformed comments. The fact is : The GOP/Congress resolved from day 1 of the Obama presidency, and did everything they could, to block anything and everything he did, set him up for failure, made sure he will never ever succeed. The grace and dignity of that man in the face of such hostility was/is astounding.

0,"We will not cut spending until GDP can support it - which means the only way to cut deficit spending would be to grow (you do not cut your way out of problems), which under Obama's stifling regulations would never happen. Trump may not do much better, but I promise you he will take a different route. Under Obama we didn't even have a chance. I worked in the energy business during Bush/Obama transition and thought they were making good advances in APC (wet scrubbers) for Coal plants , and when Obama came in the whole business collapsed, I was not totally aware at the time as to why, but now I  know.

In her place Trump will be accompanied by his assistant Iyankya (sporting a Hugo Boss designed black copa cabana magna and matching stilettos). trump plans to upstage Queen Elizabeth's gift to Francis by presenting him with three cases of Viginia's finest trump brand wine and a box of steaks.

No one has felt the effects of the minority of voters choice yet.  But recall that there were 2.8 million more votes for HRC than for Trump, so the majority of Americans are as tolerant as one would believe.  Those who are avid Trumpers also collect unemployment, have parents on social security and disability, get government loans for everything from tuition assistance to health care coverage to food stamps.  As those benefits are cut and restricted, and a whole lot more meet Paul Ryan's axe, and as the facts of the new president's cabinet are all in the 1% and not a working class individual among the lot, are seen in action and the results made clear, and, not the least, that President Trump stumbles and falls in every single area of that office, he will be seen as the inept blowhard that he is.

Just because there is so much corruption in the dem party does not in any way say there is not any in the repub party. A large percentage of our population is fed up with this corruption. From my vantage point, so many of the dems. in this country, and right here on this site, want to try and take the high road and say just look over there at the repubs. and don't ever accuse us dems. of corruption. It has gone so far as your vote for the dem. establishments choice is designed as a reward for the corruption. The leaders of the parties use fear, insults and hate to control their voters, and as we see by the support given to one of the most corrupt family's in the history of the US it works.  Trump is an outsider, he is despised by the leaders of both parties, he is not beholden like they are, and the people of our nation want a change from the status quo. See how easy this is to understand?

0,"The system is not broken. Aside from the representation that the electoral college gives all parts of the country, a direct popular vote would not have necessarily resulted in the same vote totals. Politicians campaign in states according to the electoral map such as battleground states. In Trump's case it did no good to campaign in the large metropolitan coastal areas because they were not going to  him even if the population was only 51% for Hillary. Furthermore you can expect that many republicans stay home in these states because they know which way their particular state will go. I believe this is still a majority conservative country by a long shot.

It’s not sex (which they are obsessed with) but the thousand other details of life that are best done with a spouse.  The basic adult right is to divorce yourself from your family of origin (or divorce your spouse and return to them) and to be one flesh under law.  That does not happen without legal marriage.

That starts with winning some elections at the state and local levels, in order to regain those state legislatures that have gone from blue to red in recent years.

And give Clinton no chance of exonerating herself by saying “I cannot predict” how long it will take to assess the material?  The most benign, and likely, explanation is CYA: Comey wanted to inoculate himself against future allegations from Republican lawmakers that he sat on relevant information before the election. If so, self-preservation trumped his professed love of transparency.  By falling short of his own standards of transparency, Comey is harming both election integrity and his well-deserved personal integrity. He needs to explain himself if he hopes to salvage either. —Dana Milbank

0,"Icon, I read the article carefully and completely.  Thank you for the link.  Several things struck me immediately.  First, it was a long time ago.  1972-5 or so.  That is more than 40 years ago.  Second, young Trump (Donald) had just joined his father's real estate business after finishing school in 1968.  Whatever policies existed in his father's company likely existed before Donald Trump had any role.  Third, this occurred so long ago that the fair housing bill had only recently been passed.  This was a time of great change when prior centuries of discrimination was being identified and ended.  The status quo was being changed for the good.  But in such times, people are still figuring out what is proper behavior.  This is especially true when it was Donald's Dad who was calling the shots.  Finally, the government's case was never proven.  No, I think in the end the article reenforces my impression that his """"racism"""" is politics.

Since Trump was not under investigation, he was frustrated by the fact that Comey would not publicly announce this, to """"lift the cloud"""". As others have noted, pretty much every detail potentially damaging to Trump was leaked to the press, but the crucial fact that Trump was not under investigation was kept a closely guarded secret. Presumably, members of select committees and possibly some journalists knew this, but some of them continued to act and talk as if there was an investigation of Trump. Even top Democrats reluctantly admit that there is no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia and no evidence of any crime.

It gave Obama's a record taking the country from collapse to recovery and constant growth in the stock market, GDP, and employment. Trump takes over a country that at the end of Obama's run had reached all time gains in the economy, the stock market, and employment near full employment. This puts pressure on Trump to maintain these conditions throughout his term-- much like Bush was pressured to maintain the growth under Clinton who set records for employment gain and was the only modern President to cut the deficit with a positive year. Bush failed because of his bad policies, and a war, but also because of the down shift of the economy.

Put them side by side and question why you give one (Clintons) an unquestioning pass and confidently condemn the other (Trump).  When you consider that the actual evidence is equally weak against either, why is one seen as obvious slander and the other an admission of guilt?

0,"Personally, I am edified by President Trump's executive order.  As President, Mr. Trump's primary and most important duty is to protect the citizens of this nation.  Imagine, if a refugee allowed in committed an act of terror costing American lives - the outrage at Mr. Trump for his """"failure to protect the homeland"""" would be virulent and immediate!  And, all the soft-hearted folks out there, I wonder if they leave their front doors wide open 24/7, allowing anyone who claims to be in need to wander in, to help themselves to anything in their homes, eat their food, sleep in their beds, play with their kids - all without asking any questions about those folks.  I wonder if, after asking those questions and agreeing to allow Person X into their home, they see a news report of an alleged murderer who fits Person X's description (though there is no absolute proof that Person X is indeed the murderer), would they still let him in or perhaps vet him further?

0,"Arpaio, who is now 85, is scheduled to be sentenced on 5 October for his criminal contempt conviction by a judge on 31 July.  However, he plans to appeal the conviction and get a trial by jury.  It would be best for Trump to hold off doing anything while the appeal plays out.  If the appeal is approved and Arpaio is found not guilty by a jury, end of situation.  If the appeal is denied and Arpaio is subsequently sentenced or if he is found guilty by a jury, Trump could then decide whether to commute the sentence, as President Bush did for Scooter Libby, or pardon Arpaio.
"
0,"Whether you can define it as treason or not is irrelevant.  What Trump has allegedly done is illegal and if found guilty (which will be tough to prove since he is the POTUS) he should be punished (along with Pence since he was the VP candidate and they were elected together).  One could argue that his alleged behavior was treasonous just as easily.  By the way, I think it is even more bizarre how the far right is coming out as Putin lovers.  What bizarre times we live in.  Dragging out Jane Fonda to defend your position is a bit desperate but I think that controversy can be argued either way.  I was just a baby then so it is difficult for me to really feel what that was like then.

A trained journalist, is required to at least search for dependable sources, and seek confirmation.     You don't win pulitzers on inuendo and inflaming accusations.  Those who have depended on reliable journalism for our news, have been shaken by the corporate news ownership that controls the front line journalist.   It's neither liberal or conservative, it's profit driven.     The corporate investor class is 'the establishment'.  They seek stability, the same environment that has made them 'winners'.    The rowdy iconoclast reporter is a relic of the past in corporate media.  Media is not the journalist, it's ownership and anybody who works for wage knows what that means.  A lot of good journalist have been forced into independent work and in the long run that may be a very good thing.

1,"It has been my experience that people get some things right even though they sound a little goofy. I think supporting Trump is a bit like that. There are some things he says - just like Bernie says - that reflect how many folks feel about the politics of this country. So the answer to your question is - no. Electro shock is simply too expensive on an individual basis - and the outcome is in question as well - ha!!  But when we tell folks that we don't know from Adam - whose political support we seriously disagree with - that they are stupid, misguided, or in need of electro shock - particularly if we are masquerading as some arbiter or truth and rational thought -(which Haycox always sees himself as) - then we stop being agents of change and start being agents of war.  To me Haycox is like Hannity - boys who bring matches to a flammable party. I think Trump is a nut job - but I still value my friendships with those who support him too much to call them stupid. That's my politics.

I realize that Trump has taken American democracy to new levels of low with vague promises and a weird pride in being uneducated about the world in general..., but there is no excuse for the rest of us to continue to degrade American ideals.  There is no need to follow such poor examples of supposed leadership.  A respect for the separation of church and state has be degraded slowly over the past 3 decades.  If we choose to form a Christian government, then our hypocrisy pulls all moral high ground out from under our own feet. We would be no better, and eventually no different then ISIS or the Taliban.  Religious political power always becomes the most destructive and oppressive kind of power.  Kaaihue's ignorance, requires that our voices should be united and loudly against her.

0,"Saint Obama was elected to deliver us to the Promised Land of Hope and Change; Donald Trump is our newly hired employee.  Obama led us to three new wars in the Middle East (Libya, Syria, and Yemen) paid for with trillions of new debt.   He has authorized Iran to have nuclear weapons in 15 years.  He has just initiated a US  Armored Brigade to be stationed in Poland across from Russia.  He has killed thousands of innocent civilians with drone strikes by both the military and the CIA in Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria with no prior oversight but that of himself.  Who told him to do all those things?  Why it was justified when Hillary and that particular Congress voted to support Bush's Iraq War.  That is all the justification he (or now, Trump, of course) require.  Good luck with trying to turn Trump into an 'employee'!

But there's no denying that amid growing media consumption online, older print media which have not fully transitioned to online earning strategies are facing challenges which somehow do filter down to editorial pressure, not as content, but as fighting for a corner and respect.  Can they all make it by adopting the earning strategies of the Huffington Post or similar entities? I hope so.  As a consumer I do not want to pay to print & deliver a newspaper, but don't mind paying a fair price for content. In return, I don't want the media taking hilarious moral stances based on thin or even thick impressions, or insulting readers who think differently without assessing the quality of their thinking.  Fixing on a phrase spoken by a Donald Trump without assessing the entire dynamic of the situation and its resolution, misses the point in my view.

The general consensus was that Trump isn't going to build a wall or bring back the steel industry or end ACA or save the coal mines.  They don't care.  He expresses their anger and hatred and that makes them feel good.  Their biggest complaint was with football players kneeling during the anthem.  The bigotry around that issue was staggering.  Mind you, these are the same folks whose relatives are dying from opioid OD's by the hundreds.  They are so numb to this that a five month old who starved to death in her bassinet because both her parents OD'd was 'oh well that's a shame'.  That Trump has done nothing about this, and his policies will in fact make the situation more hopeless doesn't matter.

0,"Trade relations are based on the interests of each nation involved. These interests are best served by fair dealing coupled with mutual accommodation of interests wherever reasonably achieved. While any NAFTA country can initiate negotiation aiming to correct deficiencies and improve North American trade and commerce, this should be done with mutual respect.  This week’s actions by President Trump blatantly disregarded these norm regarding Mexico. Further, serious collateral damage to supply and production lines upon which Canada relies are unilatterly and cavalierly threatened.  Further yet, we saw in the announcement regarding Keystone XL that Trump is prepared to contravene the spirit and probably the letter of NAFTA (i.e. demanding US sourced pipes) in its dealings with Canada whenever he chooses.  Whatever differences Mexico and Canada might have over specific NAFTA provisions, they should remain together and resolute in opposition to attempted bullying.

The proletariat are all equal in their misery. As long as the dictators are friendly and can offer the Liberals' corporate-globalist associates some business, this sort of thing can remain politely unmentioned.  The new-left has no problem with human-rights abuses by left-wing totalitarian governments, whether China or Cuba or Venezuela, instead finding a new outlet for their anti-Americanism in the Trump feeding frenzy.

The electoral college was to make damn sure tyranny by majority is not how we elect a national President. The Electoral college makes damn sure all states have a voice in who represents us as a nation.

That core value isn't wanted in Canada and all Muslims should be asked upon their acceptance into Canada if that is an ideology they hold near and dear. If so they should be disallowed admission on that issue alone. No one in Canada asks the hard questions and if we did the rediculous pot head PM we have would never have been elected.

Much as I don't like Trump as President, he did well, and his momentary lapses into overly characterizing things as terrific were eminently forgivable.  So, we see he is capable of acting like a normal, effective leader.  Can he sustain, reproduce, or change his approach to consistently reflect that capability?  Clearly he is capable.  It is his opposition's job to positivelyh reinforce that capability and execution.  Congratulations, Mr. President.  So far, you've had a very, very good day.  I though I'd hate writing that.

Seems to me that Russia & other foreign powers who are anti-America would benefit greatly from a Hillary presidency.  [1.] Hillary is nurtured by foreign powers by the constant threat of blackmail. [2.] Hillary in office will most likely create a constitutional crisis from day one. [3.]  Thus a Hillary presidency will be the most ineffective in history, leaving the USA & it's interest even more weakened in world affairs to such a degree Russia and others could do as they please unopposed.

Without even knowing it she exposes the whole motivation behind this recent resurgence of anti male sentiment- jealousy of her daughter. Yup, that's right. The 26 yr old daughter instinctually understands that she has total equal rights now and mom is well, irrelevant. So what does irrelevant mom do when her younger version and her entire generation decide she's irrevelant? She starts a war (on men) to get back in the spotlight and uses cardboard cutout morons like Trudeau and his wife to exploit her useless cause. And how many times has his pattern been repeated in the past few years?

Bush's comments look downright progressive when compared to Donald Trump's, you know that Trump is somewhere off to the far, far, right.

0,"Trump is dangerous because either he doesn't think about what he says or he considers, carefully, what he says.  E.G.  If one claims that an election is rigged, then one can claim that the results are not legitimate.  If one claims the results of the ballot are illegitimate then one can propose that the government is not lawful and that it can be resisted non-violently or violently.  The boundary between 'free speech' and 'action' is quite clear when people organize and take to the streets in protest, to the ballot box, or take up arms in rebellion.  Trump's remarks, at no cost to himself,  even if a hinted suggestion, have the ability to sanctify the latter (organized rebellion against an illegimate government).  Trump can argue that he didn't say this, but the logic implies it.  So does he say these things without thinking or does he think about what he says?

The flacks are already lining up and trying to grease the oily and corrupt Trump regime's wheels. So times are good if you are a consultant with neo-fascist sympathies.

The 60's turned out millions of marchers into the streets largely due to their united fear, loathing, dislike, etc., of President Nixon.  Trump is by far more of a consistently motivational figure to spur mass uprisings.  He'll make Nixon look like Mr. Popularity by comparison.  There's no Vietnam War, but a President Trump will be able to much, much worse that will motivate millions to rise up. I'm quite optimistic for a progressive future.  There will be lots of serious and irreversible negative consequences of his presidency, but there will be a significant backlash to conservatism.

Saudis aren't on the list because they own a big piece of Trump, Inc., and of course their oil. Oil always trumps safety, no pun intended. Racial profiling will not work to make us any safer and anyone who says so is a liar! Terrorist organizations are not so stupid as to keep sending young Arab looking Muslim men to do their bidding. They are quite capable of recruiting the blonde and blue-eyed or any other willing body that does not fit the profile. And, the last stat I saw said 78% of terrorist attacks, successful or not were planned and/or committed by American citizens. Trying to pin all terrorist attacks on one group or race is a recipe for disaster. It creates a condition called tunnel vision which means an obvious threat could be ignored because it doesn't fit the profile. Think outside the box!

No bottleneck, more oil to flood the market. #3. Why do you think their share prices went up?  Because of safer shipping?  No, because of more and cheaper oil going to market.  But not to worry.

Many of those groups cited this language as a sign of support from Trump and their white supremacy agenda. David Duke gave a statement about the Charlottesville rally in which he said the groups at the rally would carry out the policies of Donald Trump.

That lack of grey matter was also found to impair memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language and consciousness.  That's the science behind Trump's inability to commiserate with others. It explains his bizarre behaviour toward war widows (along with the people of Puerto Rico and numerous other groups).  What's more difficult to explain is the extent to which the military, which has traditionally prized character above all else, would have voted so overwhelmingly (67%) for a man who demonstrates none - a man who avoided military service himself but who nevertheless questioned the bravery of soldiers who allowed themselves to be taken alive.

If you feel people who use brand X will have more fun or be more successful with women or whatever, you're more likely to buy brand X.  Donald Trump, IMO, the consumate Snake Oil salesman, has spent his like creating impresssive perceptions of himself, and it's worked rather well for him.  However, he's now in a position of immense power which also comes with high expectations and tremendous accountability.  He enjoys the power and resents the accountability.  That accountability accounts for his exceeding low approval ratings....35 % is the lowest of any President since such polls were instituted.  For more and more Americans, their perception of Trump has changed and they're rejecting the Snake Oil.  I would suggest their perception is more reflective of reality

As such what he does and says does affect the world I live in even if not me directly.  If Germany fit the same relationship situation with Canada then I'd be concerned about Merkel's actions as well however the evidence is clear that she conducts herself as a leader in a way far more befitting her position and in a more mature and responsible way than Trump has demonstrated to date.

This is a non-story generated by the press to make Trump look bad.  It doesn't matter if Trump accepts the election results .

Immigration has been the backbone of growth in this country throughout its history.  Many immigrants start new businesses. The immigrants in universities and other professional sectors earn most of the patents that are awarded these days, especially in the research universities.  Most Americans are the descendants of immigrants who would fail Trump's gold-plated test - Trump's own grandfather would not qualify.  Nor would Kellyanne's grandparents, nor would the Mooch's and most other Trump staffers.  The low-skilled labor is also needed. There are already farms in the US who can't get the labor they need to plant and harvest. Low-skilled jobs are not being filled now because of fear of ICE.  Mar a Lago has requested several dozen special visas to fill such rare talent jobs such as housekeeper, bus boy, waiter etc. The hypocrisy reeks.

His campaign managers were simply smart enough not to get him directly involved and allowing only his lower level workers to get involved. The findings just seem to point to their awareness and their skirting the issue and using back channels to receive and give information.

0,"The media, and frankly much of the broader public that didn't vote for or want a Trump presidency still fails to look at why he got elected other than tactics and because everyone who vote for him is stupid, a racist or misogynist. Some may have voted for those reasons, but it does not explain his election. That is what should be editorialized about. That is clearly beyond the capacity of the Globe. Their editorializing since Trump's election and prior have been, and I expect will continue to be, facile. Most MSM has followed that pattern, though I find the Globe is one of the worst.

One thing - and this is true of Canada, as well - is that the US has held together and functioned well enough, and true to its founders, through many difficult and challenging times in our over 200 year history.  We could withstand and survive even a Trump presidency, although I am certain he wouldn't survive his first year in office.  But not to worry.  All of the projections and analysis show that Sec. Clinton will be sworn-in as President on January 20, 2017.  We are not a nation of fools, as the radical right would have us all believe.

The only """"rigging"""" we've seen is the systematic voter suppression perpetrated in GOP controlled states, counties and precincts.  Of course, you might reference the 2000 presidential election in Florida where the results were determined by a conservative controlled Supreme Court.

My self interest dictates that I vote for Hillary because I know her to be both a competent politician shaped by America's corrupt society that worships the rich and its concomitant political system and is the only logical choice for president. I'm mature enough to know that only fools can pretend to be unsullied by this sad manure heap of a society we call America. The Republican party must die in order to be reborn as something else.

The poor fellow is wretchedly unwise and he is going to drag a lot of people down, including a great many of his supporters.. From Canada's point of view, I think we need to retain our friendship with our great neighbour to the south even as we try still more to strengthen our economic and social connections elsewhere.

Both major parties were corrupt and toxic, so the voters refused to swallow either of their Krool Aid. Trump at least promised, like Obama, to end our war for empire. Like Obama, he lied, but while Hillary was making speeches promising the world to Wall St. Trump was at least campaigning in Rust-belt states, where desperate workers just wanted someone to speak for them. And that's how he won the anachronistic electoral college. Democrats could have abolished that when they had power, but Obama chose to compromise with evil rather than fight it.

FYI, State health coverage of former employees becomes secondary to Medicare when Medicare eligibility kicks in (currently at age 65).  If the vouchers aren't enough to buy private coverage that is as good as what current Medicare coverage is now (and/or the Medicare age is raised), it would seem to me that the costs the State has to pick up through State secondary coverage will have to rise to cover the difference and/or State coverage as primary would last longer (if Medicare age is raised) and thus State retiree health care costs will grow even faster than already forecast.  Did Alaska Trump voters realize that?

Today's aircraft are limited on many fronts by their need to keep the pilot alive and a humans inability to handle extreme G forces. Pilot-less planes can be made smaller , go faster , and carry a greater payload ---which is the future for defending America. His demanding  Air Force I cost less is another great example . When the military is rebuilt with no 600 dollar toilet seats we will see our tax dollars well spent to keep us all safe.  North Korea with their unstable leader and ability to hit Alaska with a nuke is our greatest threat at this time.  IF Putin was behind the leaks that exposed the truth about Hillary Clinton , we owe him a thank you.  Imagine if Trump and Putin work together to destroy ISIS .  Better world .

No other person running has had both parties against them and nearly the entire press fighting against him as well. He defied those odd's because he spoke for those of us American's who felt they had no voice. His position on issues is what is needed to make America great and safe again.  On a personal note , years before he ran for president I asked if I could send a book of his down to N.Y. for him to sign for me.  With my copy of his book I included cash for the return postage . He not only signed my book--he mailed it back--including all the cash I had sent . He paid for the return postage himself.  Does that sound like a guy only in it for himself to you ?

0,"A problem with feel-good articles is when researched, often you end up not feeling so good. And, once again, ridiculing Trump when he's correct is not satisfying at all. A look into what solar energy means in proportion to the total energy use of Chile, and you easily formulate distressing numbers of facilities like this required to be mathematically significant in the total energy usage in the world. Keep in mind this is the largest facility in the world in the prime spot in the entire world. The article doesn't make mention even a small country like Chile is 74% dependent on fossil fuels for energy, and, is building more coal-fired power units currently. So, while all the hub-bub seems great as we are being continually reassured solar power is becoming significant, the facts are it isn't, save for small pockets of supply which affect very little the ravenous requirement used around the world.

Jason Chaffetz has written a demand letter for the Comey memo, and is willing to subpoena the White House to get the tapes, if they exist. The investigations of the Russian attempt to influence the election in Trump's favor will move forward and I think eventually find that the Trump campaign was complicit, and that Trump knew and approved; but the attempt to obstruct that investigation has the potential to end this presidency even before the Russia investigations are complete. If you think of Trump's corruption as a communicable disease, then everyone who works with him is susceptible -- and the closer, the more susceptible. When Trump goes down, he won't go alone.

The day before Trump moved forward with a military strike on Syria, his Secretary of State, Tillerson, was unusually blunt in discussing the most recent North Korean missile launch - the US """"has spoken enough"""" on North Korea was more or less the meat of the statement. What followed the next day in Syria speaks for itself and will be heard loud and clear in China, North Korea, and Iran.

0,"Or, put another way, that is the whole reason why the Electoral College system was put in place hundreds of years ago: To prevent one state with a large population from completely overwhelming the desires of many small states.  California and New York voted very heavily in favour of Clinton, Texas voted pretty heavily in favour of Trump and Florida was almost an even split with Trump winning by a tiny margin.  Those 4 states make up more than a third of the population of the U.S. and each is more populous than the 15 least populated states.  The rough idea of the U.S. political system is that the House of Commons provides representation by population (more or less), the Senate provides representation by State and the President is a bit of a mix of the two.

0,"WEll, that would be nice. But whatever Trump thinks he can do, he cannot force all the automobile manufacturers to exclusively build their cars in the USA. And if he does what he says and slaps a huge tariff on foreign built cars then cars in the USA will become much more expensive, which is supporters will not like. Moreover, American cars will become more expensive outside of the USA because other countries will respond in kind to Trump's tariff. And so American car sales will plummet.  Trump isn't just wrong about how to deal with his jobs issues, he is painfully naive. Not to mention dangerous.

0,"So Trump wants to spend $54 billion on our national defense, largest increase in defense spending since Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan used military spending not as a national defense program but as a method of job creation. It worked temporarily but it left behind one of the largest increases in the deficit of any peace time President. The increase to the national debit was 40%. Many of the costly programs were passed onto George H.W. Bush who in only four years increased the national debt by an additional 17%. Unemployment rose from 5.4 to 7.4 percent.  But with a balanced budget promised by Donald Trump and massive tax reform we have no worries.http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/26/news/economy/donald-trump-balanced-budget/

These more liberal economists opposed the conservatives who argued for austerity and cuting spending and cutting the deficits as mush as possible to balance the budget and lower the expense of repaying interest and debt. The liberals wanted to allow deficits to run higher in order to increase economic growth and continue to spend and eventually economic growth would pay off the deficit with increased economic growth that would give government tax revenue to pay down the deficit and the national debt. This change to allowing deficits has not hit all Republicans and we will see some conservative resistance, but it will be hard to beat the political appeal of cutting taxes to allow deficits to grow and fuel economic growth.

I hope we strip out the fantasies of both parties in the next few months.  They dress up to 'sell,' not be ready to perform in the aftermath of the election.  Elections are for show.   Trump is way behind in terms of trying to figure out real policy.   Trump's strategy is misdirection, being as he personally has no idea of what it takes to pass legislation.

Clearly,  the trends are in his favor, regardless of the content of the headlines.   Most states are still controlled by Republicans.  When a veteran Republican loses, it is more often to a more conservative Republican than a Democrat.  The only trend that favors Democrats might be ethnic demographics, but it is unclear if this is growing fast enough.  Many of the spikes in Hispanic pop growth are in states solidly RED, so no help there.  We should not be surprised to see him win.   Only strategic and significant voter registration and turnout might change this trend.  Just enough Green or Libertarian votes will clinch it for Trump.

I am aware of far too many instances of high ranking persons placing and leaving sensitive data in place where they should not have.  Mostly this is done for 'convenience' but as can be seen for Mrs. Clinton, the results were quite disastrous.  Since people with conservative leaning tend to be less tech savvy than those with liberal leanings, they tend to expose more sensitive data as a rule.  Conversely, their conservative Luddite nature often makes them more paranoid and less likely to employ leading-edge technologies.

Canada may not run a trade surplus in manufactures but we do in certain industries (ex. softwood) and the US will cherrypick for decisive wins wherever there to be found.  In short, Canada better have its own list of unfair US trade practices with which to bargain and be cultivating trade allies and new markets.

Yet there is  plenty of 'proof' Trump condemned   hate groups  claiming to support him   Bernie apologizes after the fact, but at least he does it..  Hillary quietly smiles while trashing  half America.  And she woders why she lost? Talk about peanut butter and brushes..she painted 1/2 the country as irredeemable  'deplorable's '  during the campaign.  Now that's """"hate""""  coming.from her own lips.

Personally, I cannot see Comey entering that meeting WITHOUT a recorder on. It was his job as Director to gather evidence. In my opinion, it is a given.

In these discussions I'm hearing a lot of doubts expressed about Trump's ability to pick good leaders and make good decisions. That's primarily left-leaners who see things changing and mourning that their candidate lost. What gives me hope is that Trump is CEO of a complex and profitable $11B corporation. He didn't get there by being stupid and over the years he has developed a keen skill for evaluating people for their leadership abilities and putting them in positions where they can develop and deliver both growth and profits. So it will be interesting seeing how quickly and severely his management style conflicts with the entrenched bureaucracy and how much change he is actually able to drive. He has outlined an aggressive 100-day plan that I think is going to surprise a lot of bureaucrats by how quickly it knocks their ivory towers out from under them.

The goal of racial equality, freedom of marriage, a woman's right to equal pay for equal work, a woman's right to privacy, taking guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally disturbed with stricter gun laws, and freedom of religion.   This, in addition to academic focus, is what college teaches.  I absolutely believe that everyone has a right to believe what they want, and vote how they want.  In this election, the majority of people voted for more progressive views.  Unfortunately, the electoral college rewards a rural vote as heavier than an urban vote.  Rural voters should not get more say than what a majority of Americans say.  Colleges are good, and provide an inclusive environment for liberals and conservatives alike. That is NOT what Donald Trump provides. I hope and pray that the folks who voted for him take a cue from universities and let equality reign #1.

While other Alaska and national Republicans put their names on the Trump campaign just because he was voted the Republican nominee, Murkowski withheld her support from day one.  In August she said, """"I’m not a fan of Donald Trump. He’s made statements and raised opinions that I certainly can’t defend. In fact, some of them I find offensive. I am looking along with a lot of Americans to see, OK, going forward in these next few months – what is he going to be laying down? What is he going to be putting down in terms of policies. How is he going to assure me as a woman, how is he going to assure me as an Alaskan who represents a state like ours, how is he going to assure me that he is going to make our nation safer?”  Murkowski gave Trump a chance to show he was worthy of her support as a woman, an Alaskan, and an American.

0,"Good point made in letter re Broadbent, Trump and PR. Many Republicans voted for Trump despite all his serious failings, because the put party first.

In MMP, this is clear as one vote is strictly by party and this vote overrides the local vote as the number of seats in Parliament are determined by the party vote not by the local vote. In STV this is indirect, but with ridings 3 to 5 times larger with 3 to 5 times as many candidates, it is impossible to get to know all the candidates, the ballot has so many names on it, that people end up voting by party by default.  That is how to end up with a Trump - the person matters less than the party.  No, PR is not in the best interests of Canadians.

The only sane path is to work to reduce tensions and nuclear weapons, unfortunately, we seem hell bent on heading in the opposite direction.
"
1,"You have an axe to grind against Trump, but Trump is going to be ok.  He has a team of lawyers who have been backing him in the dirtiest of businesses.  What the witch hunters are doing is making themselves look like the sore losers that they are, apparently not even bothering to consider that even if Trump is removed (and he won't be)  Mike Pence will likely be worse in terms of policy (Pence also has a conservative social policy that Trump is shying away from).
"
0,"3/3 But to acknowledge Trump as a legitimate president does not mean that we should “normalize” him. We can’t accept as “normal” a president who is utterly unqualified for the office: racist, sexist, fascist; corrupt, incompetent, unstable.  His inauguration won't rehabilitate him; he is who and what he is. We can’t allow that to be a new normal for future presidents, and we can’t act as though this is a normal presidency.  We must do everything we can to contain and restrain Trump’s fascist impulses, and we must try to minimize the damage he will do to everyone except for folks in the top 1% or 2% (by wealth). He’s going to break most of his promises, which is bad; he’s going to try to keep some of them, which is worse. He’s forming a government of, by and for the filthy rich. He’s a reckless, dangerous man. No, this can’t be normal.

1,"Donald Trump is a man who stretches the truth or manufactures most of what he says in public — spreading mistruths, exaggerations or outright lies. He can tolerate no criticism of any kind, adheres to no obvious standards of conduct and has outright rejected conventions of ethics and transparency. When he is called out on any of this his standard reactions are more lies or cries of unfair, fake news or dishonest media. This man is not only unfit for office, but a dangerous demagogue with fascist leanings.

Does he have the clout to revert Alaska to that disastrous era.  If you allow the state legislators to get there hands on that money they will certainly waste it again.  She risks these oil companies finally having enough and leaving our state!

0,"Trump's governing, so far, has been spot on. No derangement there. His """"lying"""" has seemed deranged to those who are deranged. He has been labeled a liar by the press, Democrats, some Republicans and by others. Since they put that label on him, he lives up to it. It confuses and bewilders them. They can't handle a liar that lies blatantly to your face. But, they'll praise liars that lie behind your back like, Hillary, BIll, Obama and Schumer. That is deranged.

He knows full well Bannon is more effective outside than in.
"
0,"Mr. Harper makes valid points, ones which had caused me concern as well. Harper's not alone in thinking that the government are on the wrong track on the NAFTA file. Underlying the Trump Administration stance is the need to have support in certain states to enable re-election, one of which, Wisconsin, is not going to be very happy if the U.S. accepts continuance in any shape or form of the protectionist measures to support Canada's commercial dairy farms, quota cows. With 300% import duties (300%, sounds familiar).  From this standpoint, it's not Canada's interests the Liberals are defending, it's their chances of re-election in Quebec in particular that are their bottom line, just as Trump's depend on support in Wisconsin. It was a famous Canadian who once put the case this way: """"WHO SPEAKS FOR CANADA?"""". We are defending our cows at all costs. So are the dairy farmers from the Badger State.

The good news is that it doesn't matter what liberal moonbats think - they have no say in the process whatsoever, and you can thank your hero Harry Reid for making it impossible to stop the appointments, or even SCOTUS appointments.  Democrats now control exactly 5 States out of 50.    If you liberals haven't figured out your trajectory by now - and judging from Pelosi's hilarious deathgrip on her minority leadership position, you haven't - you soon will in 2018 when you are completely divested of any kind of political power.  In the meantime, President Trump is gearing up to fix this country and wipe away the 'legacy' of your community organizer.   We're about to witness the beginning of a great new era in America, and I'm proud that Alaska was part of putting the right man in the White House.  Cheers!

0,"Will the real cry baby please sit down. The media made big big money exploiting every outlandish statement made by Trump. Then they piled on bullying him every day in every way. More, the media made Trump president.  The media could have made Bernie Sanders president. But focusing on Trump's sensationalist statements every day as his popularity grew, they made Trump president. Now they're trying to find somebody to blame for their failures.  We  all know Donald Trump is a fascist who gets more aggressive when his authority is challenged. But the G & M and the rest of the establishment are the experts on doubling down when their authority is challenged. Just look closely: Everything the readers want in their national newspaper, they get the opposite.

Inslee and Obama, of course, back in 2012 voted for and passed the NDAA of 2012 which authorizes the president to repeat what FDR did to Japanese Americans.  I have seen not a single shred of condemnation from you about what they did, only vocal support of both politicians.  Can you please direct me to any public condemnation you made in 2012 or 2013 or even 2014 until now that rebukes Obama, Inslee, or any other politician for making it legal to repeat the camps?  Also, any public condemnation you've made about Obama assassinating Americans without charge or trial outside war zones would be appreciated if you've made one.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provide on this rather dated,but still incredibly relevant topic.
"
0,"Trump is a transgressive personality. He thrives on creating disorder, in violating rules, in provoking outrage. He is a shock jock. This might be a tolerable in a reality television star; it is a dangerous one in a President. He is unlikely to be contained by norms and customs, or even by laws and the Constitution. For Trump, nothing is sacred. The truth is malleable and subjective. It is always about him.  Trump has given people many reasons to worry. A man with illiberal tendencies, a volatile personality and no internal checks now occupies the most powerful office in he world. This isn’t going to end well.

0,"This whole thing is a no win situation for Trump, one side or the other was going to throw a tantrum no matter what he does. First off, there was no Russian operatives controlling the election not a single vote was changed. Even if the hacking of the DNCs email was by Russia, who cares, the fact is the DNC and Hillary are as crooked as a dogs hind leg, nothing that was released was untrue, the democrats are jus mad they got caught. Also there is no law that says the president has to go out of business just because he got elected. It is irrelevant that any of his companies do business with Russia or any other country.
"
0,"Yet another example of  Trump's unique style to making friends and influencing people. He is becoming more isolated every day, and it is all self-inflicted. It is unfortunate that instead of making America great he seems to be tearing it apart. By now I think I have an idea on how he has been running his companies and why he went bankrupt 5 times. Perhaps he should try some diplomacy instead.

I don't think that it's truly accurate to say that a poor mom, who does not vote because she has not seen that her vote has made any substantial difference in her life and who has not been taught why her voting does matter, when it is added to all of those other votes, is getting the govt that she deserves when Ryan cuts off food stamp benefits.   Nor do I think that I am getting the kind of govt that I deserve when, despite my best efforts, someone like Trump wins (and in my county and state, he lost -- but I'm not in PA or WI).  I don't think that our kids, who can't vote, are getting the govt that they deserve.  Etc, etc, etc........

0,"Hillary must be shaking in her pantsuit.  Comey lost a lot of credibility within the FBI when he said Hillary shouldn't be prosecuted because he could find no evidence of intent to violate the law.  The law does not require intent and many people were prosecuted under the same law and intent was never an issue.  if intent can be proven, the penalties are even worse, but no intent is required to be found guilty. The people in the FBI understood this and were very upset that Hillary was being given a pass when many very good people were prosecuted.  From that point, Comey's days were numbered.  With Comey gone, Hillary will be at risk again.  The only person that can save her now is Trump.  He better let the professionals do their job.  It will be interesting to see the Dems  change their tune about Trump.  Save Hillary, please, please save her Mr. President.  HA! HA! HA!
"
0,"Totally agree, but """"In this day of neo-liberalism"""" is not accurate. Trump is proof that there are deep cracks in the neoliberal facade. Neoliberalism is a political doctrine whose day is done. Second, the rationale for antitrust is that government action allows us to ensure that free markets continue to exist,  just not in the corrupted form we see today. So there is a deep irony: democrats want to regulate for competition; neolibs want to deregulate to close the market and decrease efficiency. Very few voters are able to figure that one out.

They are sitting around waiting for the US government to come bail them out. Down in Houston and Miami residents were at work fixing the damage the day the rain stopped. In PR they are waiting for Uncle Sammy to make a cash drop.

Funny Curious George does not remember that the Bush Administration started the bank deregulation leading to the cash of 2008 where Goldman Sachs was the big winner shorting mortgage-backed securities. Goldman was found guilty and admitted to defrauding investors. No Goldman executive went to jail but Goldman shareholders paid a $5.1 billion fine. Today, former Goldman executives have the ear of Trump and Daniel Tarullo has resigned.  Put your faith in Trump and investment bankers if you want Curious George. The G&M appears to trust investment bankers acting in the interest of the public over making money.

I think that many bought into Reagan's mantra of """"the gov't is the problem"""" and go from there.  I think that too many Trump supporters -- up and down the economic scale (except for the very top) choose to disregard the fact that there is far less transparency in business operations than in govt operations and that businesses do not operate for the public good.  Capitalism works best for the common good when its well-regulated. The """"govt is the problem"""" crowd chooses to make believe that's not true.

0,"Don't worry, every President and their advisers that were too busy to put on a uniform when they could back during the Vietnam era are always anxious to show their macho when someone else gets to fight their wars.  Trump will be no different, he'll find his Vietnam or Panama or Iraq to toss away lives of 20 year old kids to show how tough he is now.  He was too coward to put on the uniform 50 years ago, like many of the tough flag waving 70 year olds of today.  He'll get a chance to pick his fight.  Just like his warhawk Adviser/Generals, too young for Vietnam and too old to carry a gun in Iraq or Afgan.  He picks a fight with China in their backyard, he'll get his Vietnam that he skipped 50 yrs ago and you will get what you voted for.  Old man's daydreams are young men's nightmares, I've been there and done that.

0,"Do You Know Someone Suffering From Trummpy Unacceptance & Resistance Disorder Syndrome (TURDS)? TURDS is a pattern of pathologically dissociative and psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, and increasing in severity with passing time. Sufferers of TURDS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of rage, rioting, and uncontrollable crying. TURDS is caused by the election of Trummpy. People with TURDS are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is their president. Research is ongoing, but TURDS appears to correlate closely with some of the following environmental and behavioral factors: Membership in the Democratic Party, currently enrolled in college, and/or possession of a Liberal Arts college degree, living in a densely populated metropolitan area. TURDS is known to rapidly reproduce in college safe zones exponentially.

However, some American voters were feeling so bad and threatened because of the loss of social and economic status that they were led by an inner voice that we must have change whatever the consequences. Trump won in the electrocollege and not with the most voters.  Now those feelings of hate and racism have brought us to a leadership by a narcissistic and sociopathic president and it is very scary when he faces up to a man with many of the same characterlogic flaws in North Korea.  So the Democratic party lost the election with a Clinton.  Lots of people did not want another Clinton.

Also, he should move past bashing Trump, who won a greater percentage of the vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election than did Trudeau's party in 2015. Merkel's facing an election later this year, so Trump's a convenient target as well as providing a diversion from Germany's controversial migrant program. Politics is sometimes just politics rather than being anything more profound. So, JT needn't lecture us or anybody else from his precarious pedestal.

0,"Aside from his legal problems Marr and humanity face a much deeper issue. We know, absolutely, that socio-political-economic views such as Marr expresses are the antithesis of human progress.  We know that any system which fails to progress stagnates and dies.  So Marr and those like him are deadly to human society (for LFT! et.al. that means Trump and his supporters). Some posters (LFT! et.al.) accuse liberals of hate and bigotry because we reject the validity of real racists and bigots, such as Trump and Marr, as players in human affairs.  That's simple survival, not hate or bigotry. So if the political processes of representational democracy gives a voice to a Marr and economic and political power to a Trump, and we know that these people are ultimately deadly to human survival what palatable steps can we take to eradicate this very real threat?  Does free speech contain the seeds of human destruction?  Am I alarmist?  LFT! will certainly say so.  I hope for once that s(he)'s right.

0,"Rather than debate gun control, I am interested in how invoking """"evil"""" by the president changes the subject as to what has happened. My impression is that the notion of evil is a religious-based construct that suggests a spirit has influenced a person. Trump spoke in terms drawn from biblical text. For those who adhere to such tenants (and there is a lot of good in the bible), any questions about the value of these references can lead to severe condemnation. Most everyone has spiritual feelings, but these are physical acts the result of someone making decisions regardless of their rationality. We need to research the problem, something Congress has denied the funds for. Basically, it's a problem that needs science to address. Biblical based pronouncements are comforting, but they don't address a problem that is not one of evil, but of sociology and psychology.

0,"Many GOP supporters that can afford private coverage or have it provided by their employer will support this plan.  Many of the working poor who lose under this plan may well accept their loss of coverage because (a) they don't like to pay premiums and are prepared to forgo coverage on the questionable assumption that they will not get sick enough to really need it, or (b) Trump's programs will somehow soon get them better paying and more secure employment.  It may well be therefore that support for Trump and the GOP will not fall over the next 12 or so months as fast as we all assume.  However, the cumulative impact whatever changes the GOP agrees, in the end, to make to health care access, the failures in their economic and fiscal initiatives and the general chaos and meanspiritedness  of their term in control will probably catch up to them by the 2018 midterm elections and could well be quite dramatic (and negative) for the GOP by that time.

Then the message was picked up by websites like Breitbart, Redstate, and others.  After Trump loses in November, their message of hate will become even more shrill and extreme, fueling the fear that their listeners crave in order to rationalize their violent, hate-filled thoughts.  The republicans were more than happy to invite this constituency into their tent because it increased their political power.  Now their tent is burning down with them inside it.  I don't have the solution, but good republicans (and their donors) need to step up and accept some responsibility for what they helped unleash.

When asked by Howard Stern how he avoided STDs during that period, Trump made the following comments in 1997:  “It’s amazing, I can’t even believe it. I’ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there. It’s like Vietnam, sort of. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave solider.”  Trump made similar comments in a 1993 interview with Stern:  “You know, if you’re young, and in this era, and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam, we have our own Vietnam — it’s called the dating game.  Dating is like being in Vietnam. You’re the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam.”  And unlike Blumenthal, Trump never lied about his role in the great dating game war.

Charging them with committing a criminal offence would reek of kicking people when they are already down. People crossing the border who are not using approved entry points  from the US to Canada will become an issue in the upcoming NAFTA negotiations. Canada can point out that the US is sending people across the Canadian border and therefore Canada has to build a wall which the US will pay for. Trump played properly is a gift from God. Are the Justins and the Chrystias capable of recognising and properly utilising such gifts. I have no doubt but that grizzled veteran Thomas Mulcair would fare well in such circumstances.

Certainly, SOMEONE is going to benefit from all of Trump's initiatives, but the only people GUARANTEED to benefit are wealthy Americans. Through the elimination of costly regulations, the weakening of environmental and labor protection, and the cut in taxes on the rich, the only people who will without question benefit from Trump's policies are the rich... basically people like Trump himself. For everyone else, be they Trump fans or Trump opponents, there are no guarantees.

The majority of Americans should not be divided into US libs or US cons, or Democrats or Republicans..as they all have hate in common. In a nutshell, the government system is dysfunctional and unbridled capitalism is currently in its end game. And their hate is viral if we look to the UK. But we must also remember that the USA has the world's largest military force, and some Americans are already talking about annexing Mexico (if it contemplates retaliatory measures to recover from the forced costs of the ridiculous Wall). Indeed, the USA (along with Russia) has made claims on the Canadian north.  We do not want to be victims of a Trump """"deal"""".  Our wisest game plan is to bite the bullet discretely, form non-American, non-British relationships for trade and everything else. In fact, with Canada's present reputation internationally, we can have a leading role in this regard.

Anyone that took their oath to defend our constitution sincerely would have done the same. None of our victims in these illegal wars did anything to harm us, nor had the capability to do so. Did you support these illegal, unconstitutional wars? If you did then you didn't serve in any way that defended this country or the ideals it was founded on. Actually you served as an enemy of freedom, at home and abroad.

The forest/environmental issue in particular seemed to have been prepared for but not understood by Trump.

To find themselves solicited for contributions or perhaps have their property vandalized.  Strong feelings this time that there were no honest pollsters, only agents of the campaigns.

From China, PRC will enact major capital outflow restrictions to keep PRC from imploding and renminbi from being devalued. No more fuel for the Vancouver bubble.

The only fact he left out, however, was that Trump garnered more Catholic support than previous Republican candidates and in this year won more Catholics than Clinton. An important fact that he should have included. Also he failed to cite that many of these Rust Belt states traditionally have always voted Democrat but decided this year to vote for Trump, and within these states are large concentration of blue collar Catholics. Further more, we don't pay attention to what bishops say. We just don't, but we do listen to our neighbors and family members who felt Trump would bring jobs back to the United States. The Democrats are no longer believable because they are controlled by the special interest. Trump, for better or worse, is his own man and this is why he won.

The fact finders extrapolated data from some years back that is available and simply assumed that it had not changed even though in the last year reported it increased by 10 percent over the year before.  If the rate of increase remained the same in succeeding years that have not been released, he may actually have been correct.

That being a big part of Trump's campaign strategy and he has said so himself. One comment from Trump was he was getting all this for free for his campaign and Hillary was spending a lot of money. I thought at the time if Clinton was spending her own money then she could control her message and Trump was a fool to believe he could control his message by getting all the free media and essentially knocking the other candidates mostly off the air. Trump found out that he cannot control the media.  So Trump sought the media as a tool in his campaign and now is the time for him to regret doing that. Trump's choices he made for his campaign were one bad one after another.

I won't bother to mention that the health care plan Trump put forward was not cheaper, more wide-ranging, or better: it was, by independent study, more expensive, FAR less inclusive, and nowhere near as full.

A missed opportunity as it turns out.  Were the shoe on the other foot, we know Trump wouldn't hesitate for a second. We know that for sure because Trump publicly encouraged Putin's illegal intervention in the presidential elections. Indeed when it comes to principles, we know Trump and the people around him have none.  But this time Trump might have outdone himself.

That really should go without saying, but I’m going to respond on behalf of General Allen to those kinds of insults.”  Trump wasn’t done offending the military he’s running to lead. He also attacked the parents of fallen U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan.  “If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say,” Trump spewed, suggesting her Muslim faith was the reason for her silence.  Turns out, the reason she didn’t speak was because the death of her son is still so painful for her.

0,"I agree, here's my take on his wins. The Trump phenomenon - his acceptance by millions of americans as being a viable candidate for the presidency. And yet others ask, why would people vote for him? His limitations are as obvious as ….”the Emperor has no clothes”, yet they are blind to his nakedness. So, what does it all mean, really. One quietly spoken, as in fearful and worrisome, conclusion is that he is both a symptom and result in the decades long journey of removing the education of our citizens from State control to Federal control. Why this trasfer of control?,… to provide a workforce for what is known as NWO…or New World Order. This sounds far fetched but it’s been pointed out that the plan and implementation has been happening for decades - to diminish the intellectual capabilities of a nation by design.

It also goes to prove her inability to both tell the truth and stand up for what she truly believes in. The Clintons truly define perversity, both in their private lives and in past political performance, and anyone who feels differently is simply deluding themselves. Duty, Honor, Country, they used to be the hallmarks of what service to this nation consisted of, now they are simply a sick punchline for the joke political service has become.

But he will learn soon enough, just like all other politicians in the U.S.  Trump got hit like he is the many great enemies of U.S. around the world with his 'truth'. American never want the truth. The truth is racism, white supremacist have been the foundation of America. And still is to a large degree. Why do you think the U.S. killed more Asians after WW2 than it did before? Or during the war when killing the 'Japs' was official state command.  American white supremacism have aligned themselves with the black slave traders of the British empire in the 19th century. After the slave trade ended they aligned with themselves, created an uniquely American white racism. KKK and others. After WW2 they aligned themselves also with Neo-Nazi. The Nazi, of course, have exterminated Jew, Gipsys, Slav because they were inferior. This thing's been around.

For all of Mr. Trumps many faults, crude comments, etc., all which came out prior to the election, what does that really say about the alternative candidate who was rejected by America? The one who not only defended her husband concerning such acts of abusing women, maybe to the point of even enabling him, but to be so devoid of understanding the hypocrisy when confronted about it as well? She dismissed it with a statement it's all in the past, which in effect says we should just let it go, bygones be bygones! Talk about deflection!

What does matter is trying to find a way to avoid a catastrophic war that would inflict millions of fatalities (and even more casualties) on South Korea, Japan and North Korea. The USA would be spared because NK does not have a delivery system to reach North America and according to best guesses will not have that capability for about a year. So there is time for meaningful face to face negotiations. The global economic fallout would also be crushing.  Surprisingly the only two Americans that have any credibility with North Korea are Jimmy Carter and Dennis Rodman. (Can you imagine a more diverse duo?) It is entirely possible that both would try to get the necessary negotiations started, but they need a Green Light from Trump.  This is not the time to save face or show who has the bigger 'sword'. Failure to at least attempt to start face to face negotiations will answer the question of who is more unhinged.

Those responders are not citizens of a society.  They are consumers in an economy.  They are not approving policies.   How could they? There are no policies, just taglines and slogans that change from month to month.  They are just liking the brand.  That is all that matters to Trump.  He has hired some people to run the USA for him.  He will pay little attention to what they do.  He won't read reports or take briefings.  He will continue to focus on strengthening his brand.  His hirelings may keep the country out of trouble or lead America into disaster.  Trump won't care.  His brand is everything.  He is the brand, and nothing else.

In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump. (Clinton only won 4 of these counties; Trump won Richmond)  Therefore these 5 counties alone, more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country.

I'm thinking the left would scream bloody murder, if Trump closed over 300 news outlets, and threw their editors and talking heads in jail without the benefit of Habeas Corpus.  When sanctuary states secede from the union, libs would scream even louder when Trump would literally go to war and have the military march into those states, battle with the national guards, state police, etc. and impose federal law BACK onto those states.

0,"Mahalo for your thought-provoking analysis, xbt. You give us much to ponder. The Cuban missile crisis is a good point of discussion, and it underscores the thin line that Trump is tiptoeing. JFK’s justification for taking us to the brink of nuclear disaster was sphere of interest. Russian missiles so close to our shores was and still is unacceptable. By the same token, threatened US/allied nuclear strikes so close to China and Russia and possible occupation of NK is unacceptable to China and Russia. For better or worse, NK serves as a buffer to two competing ideologies. The tsunami of Chinese troops crossing the border into NK during the Korean War serves as a reminder that spheres of interest are powder kegs. The underlying issue of international conflict is overwhelmingly economics. Hopefully, Trump’s business sense is the key to a new kind of in-your-face diplomacy based on trade instead of weapons. If so, then he may be the answer.

Bill would have continued to parlay that power with no fear of serious investigation. We already know that's how they operate so to vote her into that power is to continue the abuse. We have no idea yet if Trump will abuse it, we only know Clinton did. Do you think the spouse of an elected official should be placed in charge of health care reform for the nation?

This past week Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era executive action that shielded around 800,000 young undocumented immigrants – often called Dreamers – from deportation under what’s been known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Look at other of Trump’s recent policy decisions and you see the same arbitrary and unnecessary cruelty. What’s the point of banning transgender people from military service? Of siding in court with a businessman who doesn’t want to sell his services to gay couples? Of weakening the standard for responding to sexual violence in universities? Of banning Syrian refugees and reducing by half the number of refugees admitted to the United States? There is no point, in terms of policy. None of these decisions makes America safer or economically stronger or fairer.

FDR was was the most liberal President America has ever had.

There were six positive for Clinton and negative for Trump.  Oh yes there was NO mention of the Orlando KILLER's father sitting in the vetted and invitation only area of candidate's Clinton's Orlando coronation rally.  Plenty of comments on Trump's second amendment remark.  I guess the Washington Post and so-called mainstream media have given up on ANY semblance of fairness.  If the media is going to be an official arm of the Democrat party perhaps they should be declared on reports as in-kind contributions to the FEC.

With Trump inviting Deterte to the White House , calling Erdogan to congratulate him on de democratising Turkey, heaping praise on Kim Jong-un as one smart cookie who had his work cut out for him as a young leader and his further admiration of China's Xi Jinping, I would say that Trudeau's observation that a dictatorship makes implementing policy easy was not that out of line.

Obama's approval rating was because people liked him personally---not because of the poor job he did as president.  IF people approved of what he did as president people would have elected Clinton because she was considered to be Obama's third term.  Not only that , polls showed the majority thought America was headed in the wrong direction .  Because of that fact alone , while many American's didn't like Trumps manners and boasting---they voted for him anyway.   With the press knocking Trump in all of the media its little wonder he has a 40 percent approval rating now . All he has to do is get the ball rolling on an issue or two and it will jump to 60 percent over night . If he does just half what he say's he's going to do he'll win re-election in a landslide and Pence will rule for 8 years after that.

Many, if not most, Trump supporters actually seem to believe that he can """"make things better"""", despite lack of a coherent vision, and absolutely refuse to acknowledge any of his failings.

If you know anything about European history between the world wars, you know that his assessment reflects reality. Robert Kagan, on the other hand, is a neo-con historian, and he can arrive at his determination that Trump is a fascist only by arranging facts to make a mole hill appear to be a mountain.  If Democrats and their allies keep using the """"fascist"""" label to describe Trump and his supporters, they may just succeed in getting him elected.

Gradually, I started leaning towards the Libertarians, but as I learned more about that I concluded they was almost as flawed as the """"Birchers"""". The only route remaining was to become an independent that voted for the individual. Last year I supported Sanders, but ended up voting for Clinton because Trump was so obviously totally unqualified.

So I am and will be a witness who is loud in my protest of it. To many white people, my loud protest, by itself, is called “reverse racism.” So, to many I am a racist just because I protest.  Whites can’t be witnesses against such things because they don’t know what racism and bigotry from other whites feels like. So even a little protest is seen as a monstrous act of reverse racism. They can empathize. They can march. They can voice vocal protests. And that’s all good. It needs to be done.  So even in the face of racist killings in our country and bigotry of the Trump kind, whites have to drum up the courage to make a stand against something they can't and don't and won't understand. People of color already have that kind of courage because it is a built-in mechanism for survival in America as we know it.

0,"Trump has demonstrated over and over he has no real interest or knowledge about domestic or foreign policy. His misstatements are legendary and keep coming. He is a marketing big idea guy with no interest in details, but unfortunately no self control. For most of his life he has been improvising as he goes along in order to sell something. He has through his life been a great snake oil salesman with a talent for finding others to fund and take the risk on his, often shaky and sometimes shady, but always grandiose deals. What he is selling now is fear and discontent with no specific solutions, just grand slogans and a dubious personal and business career. Another problem is an arrogant refusal to accept responsibility for his many mistakes and misstatements. He just digs in. He cannot apologize or back down, which for a potential world leader with a big mouth is scary. I for one do not believe the nation and world is such a failing and scary place...yet.

They need their side to win so badly that they are willing to swallow whatever poison pill they need to just to stick it to the libs.  Trump and his ilk supported and loved Comey until Comey started to investigate Russia. Now they act like he is a serial liar and a terrible person. Just like Trump his followers have a consistency problem. They can't keep their stories straight because they have to adjust them every few hours to stick it to the libs in a new way.

He always did so while working with others and listening to opposing views.  Trump is not the Republican Party. Trump is Trump and a burgeoning dictator. He wants a sense of power unlike any other President and has already shown that he will take drastic steps against those who oppose his view. This is a scary and unprecedented situation the United States finds itself in, and what needs to be looked at are the policies being put in place.

Trump hates Obama, and wants to destroy Obamacare, and more than he hates Obama, Trump hates the Clintons. Just despises them. Trump's focus on destroying NAFTA has nothing to do with Canada or Mexico, and there is no truth to its alleged horribleness or damage to the US. It's about the Clintons!  So it's absolutely personal.Trump is putting his personal grudge over the collective good of the American public. For that he ignores real international and domestic issues, and focuses on import/exports with only constitute about 14% of US GDP. I'd have to check, but I think maintaining the public debt takes up a larger, negative portion of GDP, so a good leader (haha, lol, as if!) would focus on that!  Thoughts?

1,"Sorry Steven, don't see how that's racist.  Obama (whose name backwards in Latin means 'I will love', and might be intepreted as vaguely lecherous) had an non-American father.  If he'd been, say, Slovenian, the level of suspicion concerning his citizenship would have been the same. Of course, Melania was Slovenian, and her name comes from the Greek μελαινα, which means black, or to the medically inclined (as 'melaena'), 'black stool resulting from an upper GI bleed'.  So if Trump were a racist, would he marry someone whose name means 'black'?  That's civil marriage, of course, because it was his third. Anyway, getting back to football, this afternoon I watched the local second XV take on Tunbridge Wells.

People from these 7 countries are welcome to go elsewhere during the 90 days. Trump promised to get vetting right; this policy was clearly coming soon, so no one can claim to be blind-sided.

Third, he “saved” the remaining 500 jobs by having his VP Pence (who is also currently Governor of Indiana) to give Carrier a $7 million tax break deal. So in essence, the taxpayer is footing the bill for keeping these workers on the payroll, not United Corp or Carrier. So, yes you can call it “bull in the china shop,” “rogue,” “unorthodox”.

What this demonstrates is the Trump campaign was willingly seeking out the help of a foreign entity to assist in winning an election. In other words, the Russian campaign to interfere with the election was based on the fact that they knew they could easily get the Trump campaign to take the bait. And apparently it worked.

But  he is sufficiently deluded that nothing he says or does can be properly understood according to the normal rules governing social intercourse.  A good rule of thumb, I suggest, is to think of Trump as a bag of instincts. As with all of us, ideas/notions/hypotheses emerge, as it were, """"from out guts"""" and take up residence in our minds. Most people understand that these """"bright ideas"""" are just that--bright ideas--and we do not willy nilly give them the status of facts without evidence; and further evidence can dethrone previously accepted facts. Trump is different--whatever arises from his gut into his brain is, in his neurotic world, ipso facto, a fact. His self-deceit is so powerful that he values his bright ideas as if they were infallible revelation. Evidence has no role in that process.

Obama didn't use the fact of black-on-black crime to justify the verdict, which was not that Trayvon was guilty - he wasn't on trial, he was dead, shot by a creepy self-appointed wanna-be cop; Obama pointed out that the jury found reasonable doubt that the armed creep committed intentional murder.

I suspect that if many of the arm-chair analysts spent some serious time in the USA they would come to know just how different things are on the ground there, versus what you think you are seeing.  I am not endorsing Clinton, or an absolving the email business.  I remember hearing I believe Mitch McConnell say during the US Presidential Campaign, that the emails would not be an issue, or keep coming up, if Clinton had just not kept her own server.  Russia would not keep coming up, if Trumps people did not have contact with the Russians.  """"what is so hard about that?""""

It is like the server/e-mail scandal - compare to what we are learning now - Trump, his family, and many current Cabinet positions continue to use private e-mail accounts while transacting federal business.  Hypocritical - meanwhile, they continue to repeat the old and now unproven meme that what Clinton did impacted US security, etc.  Unanswered question - investigation proved Clinton's use was not criminal or risked US security - we do NOT know if that is true today for the Trump Swamp???

""""The adjective republican describes a government made up of representatives who are elected by the citizens.

He has, to my knowledge, shown no real dedication to the values of a republican form of government.  He's made it very clear.  He's the MAN. He has the answers  they're simple; do as he says and everything will be fine.  That has absolutely to do with representative government.  Those GOP right-wing zealots who see The Donald as the messiah are, in my opinion, very sadly deluded.

0,"Bob Lacher - Trump is clearly a problematic candidate for Republicans (or conservatives in general) to vote for. There is every evidence that he has more in common with the Democratic Party than with conservatives, although some progressive Republicans may not take issue with his platform. Personally, I think he's been installed by the Democrats and the reason this was such a high primary turnout year for the GOP and a low one for Democrats is that a lot of Democrats crossed over to assure a problematic candidate for the GOP against an extremely weak Democratic candidate. Whether Hillary or Bernie won the primaries would not have mattered. Americans generally reject socialism and Hillary is ... well, Hillary.  Of course, the solution to the Trump problem is not to vote for Hillary if you oppose her platform. The solution is to vote for someone else. Johnson is at 12% again. Let's get him into the debates and see what he says. This is a time when polls actually mean something.

Also, a number of citations to Clinton's campaign jumping on the birther movement were given on these pages in response to other stories.

Consider: it was obvious from the outset that going into Iraq would be a disaster. Yet the people in the WH chose to ignore that reality and do it anyway. The US went in knowing nothing about Iraq yet it was surprised that things did not turn out as planned. When your brightest minds are creating that kind of policy, something is wrong.

The plan remains under serious consideration within the White House despite misgivings by Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, an Army three-star general, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Other White House officials, such as chief strategist Stephen Bannon, appear open to using private contractors…  Prince is DeVos brother.  Keeping the grifting all in the family.

My guess is that Trump will counter punch anytime he feels like it and anyway he wants, regardless of what others think or feel is correct.  Trump is beholding to nobody but his own organization and to a limited extent, his supporters.  It will be interesting to see if our system of government and laws can keep a leader like this in check, which is exactly what it was designed to do.  Congress, the courts, and more importantly, the People need to pay attention and if necessary, take action during the next four years.

However Trump has not only been an outsourcer of jobs -- but an enthusiastic supporter of it. “We are now closer to having an economic community in the best sense of the term -- we work with each other for the benefit of all,” Trump wrote in January 2013. “We will have to leave borders behind and go for global unity when it comes to financial stability.

As it happens, at the moment the US is making war in a number of predominantly Muslim countries. Had it been in the past, the target nation might have been Vietnam, or Japan.  Regardless, the affected nations contain only a small portion of the world's Muslims. Arguing that Trump's order constitutes a ban on people due to their religion is clearly a losing argument.  My personal view is that the USA should stop making war in other people's countries. But if you accept that they are, you should have zero difficulty accepting Trump's EO.

So write a column acknowledging their needs and despair, write a column saying what the US needs to do alleviate their fear and anger.

I mean seriously, after that phone call with the Australian leader, how can **anyone** conservative or liberal, possibly conclude that he is not completely insane (and I mean it in the literal sense, as in needing to be in a hospital psych ward).  EVERYONE, but everyone, can see that this US emperor is now running around stark naked, frothing at the mouth.  So Canada's best strategy is actually to just await his demise. Ignore him. Work, in the meantime, with the political leaders who are in a more reasonable frame of mind  ... the federal officials who are more sane, and more importantly, with the state people who are in positions to foster trade between the two nations.  Just work through the states, ignore Trump and Bannon, and wait for Trump to be hauled off to the psych ward and then impeached. It won't take very long.

0,"I don't think Assad is insane, but he is clearly brutal. Neither do I support the rebels. But the same condemnation falls on anyone who would use chemical weapons, be they Assad or the rebels. Assad is the one who has shown that he will use them anyway, and we have no way to assure that he disposed of all his chemical weapons or has not produced more. In fact, he has continued to use chlorine gas which is one of the components of the current atrocity, along with sarin. You seem to be getting your intelligence from the Russians who are clearly siding with Assad. We can't consider their intelligence as unbiased. Neither is American intelligence unbiased either, so we  have to use our knowledge of the actors involved and their past deeds. Can you tell me why Assad ever used chemical weapons in the past, knowing the world would condemn him? Assad may have wanted to test Trump to see if he would respond as weakly as Obama, especially since Assad has Putin backing him now. He got his answer.

0,"With respect, there needs to be more acknowledgment on the part of Clinton fans for Hillary's complicity in the wider failures of the Democratic party and the influence of big money on politics in the U.S. over recent decades. She was there for all of it and never, ever pushed for what Bernie Saunders is pushing for. Am glad for more women in politics but one of the reasons she didn't win (and why Voldemort did) is because many left-leaning persons sat on their hands for that vote. Hillary's politics-as-usual are part of the problem in the States, and the gender issue, while important, should not obscure other factors like class and the political influence of the uber wealthy. Clinton works on behalf of the rich as much as Trump does.

All we have to do is look at the huge recession brought by Wall Street and the desired GOP repeal of regulations. Tell me that Trump's supporters wanted a relaxation of Wall Street regulations and Goldman Sachs reps at his right hand in the administration. Clearly they don't, so who's really in power?

Notice that he, like many, ignore the fact that they are also Terrorist dominate nations.

The GOP just needs to bide their time.  One way or another Trump will be forced out of power or sidelined, leaving Mike Pence in charge.  With conservatives controlling both houses of Congress, the Presidency and (shortly) the Supreme Court in addition to a majority of State governments, we will then witness a destructive rightward shift in American legislative politics.  They will do as much damage as possible before 2020 and then trust in the Supreme Court to maintain the new status quo for a decade or two more.

0,"The title given to this article is another example of misleading hyperbole by the G&M when adding titles to articles.  It's the Trump Administration (Trump in particular) that has demanded NAFTA renegotiation but has been highly erratic, bombastic & dramatically unfocussed & inconsistent in proposing themes & realistic objectives in detail for NAFTA revision.  Their ever-changing & often bazaar demands (typically having a 24-36 hour shelf life) too often focus on domestic audience of the moment appeasement rather than on advancing negotiations.  In this context, Canada's best response is to present relevant US political, industry, labour & consumer interests with the facts about NAFTA's current beneficial impact (& on the enhancement of that impact which moderate updating would provide).  This Canada's negotiating team has been doing well.  Adding our own ill-considered eye-candy to this mix of crazy is exactly what Canada's team needs to avoid doing now.

0,"The challenge for President Trump’s attorneys has become, at its core, managing the unmanageable — their client. He won’t follow instructions. After one meeting in which they urged Trump to steer clear of a certain topic, he sent a tweet about that very theme before they arrived back at their office. He won’t compartmentalize. With aides, advisers and friends breezing in and out of the Oval Office, it is not uncommon for the president to suddenly turn the conversation to Russia — a subject that perpetually gnaws at him — in a meeting about something else entirely. And he won’t discipline himself. Trump’s legal team, led by Marc E. Kasowitz of New York, is laboring to underscore the potential risk to the president if he engages without a lawyer in discussions with other people under scrutiny in widening Russia inquiries, including Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser.

The DEMAND by his Attorney General Beauregard that county jailers continue to hold aliens *without a warrant* for up to 48 hours past their release time is blatantly unconstitutional. What is your issue with wrapping your brain around this fact? Courts have ruled on it. ICE needs to get an actual warrant if they want jails to hold people past their release points. Not a phone call and a pretty-please slow-walk them through release on bond until we can get there. A warrant. THAT would be constitutional. Courts have held cities liable for damages for doing the unconstitutional act that Trump and Sessions want.

The problem with this exercise of free speech is that there was evidently a woeful lack of police presence. I blame the leaders in the town for no planning and creating the situation. In other volatile demonstrations like this there is always a large police presence to keep the two sides apart.

The peaceful and lawful exercise of the right to protest ought never be construed as offensive to anyone who loves the Constitution and embraces its values. The sight of some persons kneeling peacefully along side other persons standing peacefully, all in mutual respect, honors the flag in a profound way. <Criticizing it is Trump's right.> Absolutely; Trump's rights under the Constitution are neither less nor greater than anyone else's. I suppose he has the right, too, to call the protester a """"son of a bitch.""""* However, in doing so, Trump demonstrates his ignorance of and contempt for the Constitution -- as well as his disrespect for the people of the United States.  * I wonder if my direct quote of the president's language, used in public, will get past the Civil Comments process.

Its simply not within the power of the Federal Government to provide it. If you want healthcare, refer to the State Capital to make those arguments.  “As a senior, this isn’t the country I know anymore,” Rains said. “And I will do what I can to make my voice heard.”  Pamela, considering all that  you have known most of your life is progressive policies,  I would have to agree with you; but it IS slowly becoming something I have recognized once long ago, which was less government, more liberty, and an ability of the common citizen to be more self reliant than they are today.

A) Large corps LOSE their privilege to have their taxes lowered to 20 or 15%. B). A stiff fine is levied to corps who wish to challenge the law.  C). Large corp law breakers will have their taxes RAISED to 50+% for length of time TBD. **Proceeds to be distributed to border enforcement - wall construction. D) Small businesses who violate law are subject to stiff fines penalties. E) Tax ALL repatriation via electronic transfers to foreign countries who refuse to take back their citizens (essential all).  10-15 million Illegals will pack up and leave when there is no longer LEGAL work for them.

Johnson, while I get that the libertarians want to be pretty isolationist, still couldn't talk about anything in relation to what is going on in the outside world.  I have suggested again and again that the 3rd parties need to concentrate on winning local and state elections, then move to winning Senate and House seats.  This idea that a complete outsider can show up, win, and be effective isn't realistic.

It seems that trade (NAFTA), and security against an increasingly belligerent North Korea trumps (sorry!) climate policy. Minister Freelands 'courageous' remarks were quickly followed by Minister's Sajjan's capitulation to Trump on defence spending. I believe Canada's current government is in a difficult position with regard to the current administration in Washington and their pronouncements are at odds with their actions.

Haley is out of her depth making any comment about this report. She should keep her mouth shut. Trump calling the report fake news is NOT the proper or effective response.

This is utterly irrelevant, as was the charge by Liberals against Mr Harper that he didn't get along with President Obama or the charge by Conservatives that Chretien and Martin didn't get along well with President Bush. Two years after  Canadians elect Harper, Bush is gone and replaced by Obama, and a year after  Canadians elect Trudeau,  Obama is gone and replaced by Trump. Even if O Leary were to become Conservative leader and the Conservatives win the next general election---a rather big """"if""""---by the time he became PM in late 2019 or 2020, Trump might very well be on the way out.  Canadians need to decide leaders based on their ability to serve Canada's interests, not on their ability to get along with the current President.

Auto assembly in Canada will be on the hit list- count on it, the UAW will make sure of that.  The federal and Ontario Liberals just giving Ford $200 million to locate a mobile internet research facility in Ottawa is gonna drive them around the bend.

Otherwise I look around and see if I can pick up any useful insights. Richard Roskell, for example, lately is excellent. Often even more relevant than the journalists.  But a lot of the comments aren't worth reading . As soon as I encounter bits like """"the orange haired buffoon"""" i.e. Trump, I switch off and hit disagree. It isn't about Trump per se . It's about clogging up space and wasting people's time.  It is surprising how apparently intelligent people i.e. Alceste, give in to a mob-like mentality, mean spirited and essentially shallow.  Sorry but it's true. A waste of a mind.  I disagree with your comment here because  PETROWS isn't the subject of the thread. Flattered as I am, I am not worth all of this attention.

Obama picked him to show you the hypocrisy of the GOP and it did just that, it showed the republicans would not even vote for one of their own if Obama suggested it.

You quote bush with """"He used the words “civility” and “compassion” four times each – possibly more than Mr. Trump has used those words in his life."""" And then he started the most controversial and profit focused war we've seen in our life time.  Killing in excess of 500,000 people during his total reign of terror. Now let's move onto Obama.  Current estimates put the number of civilian kills over 500 from just drone attacks.  I'm going to stop there because if you haven't gotten the point yet more won't make it clear.  Trump is your wake up call, not your call to arms against him.

0,"Democrats keep insisting there is collusion or some other misdeed committed by Trump's campaign, the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN all try to extend the same narrative. Chuck Todd even interviewed Rob Reiner yesterday ( he mentioned the last time they met was at the Democratic National convention) about his new endeavour with Morgan Freeman with the intent to inform the public about the Russian Investigation.    What they all understand is this investigation could easily and will likely begin to examine the surveillance tactics used by the Democrats and the Deep State against the Trump Campaign. The more of a nothing burger the Russian investigation reveals, the worse the Democratic party looks. After the Democrats actions against Bernie Sander and the Debbie Wassermann Shultz and Donna Brazile sagas, the Democrats can not afford to appear to have used the FBI and NSA against their political rival.

0,"That was a reasonable statement for Obama to make at the beginning of the program. They thought insurance availability would increase and companies would be rushing all over each other to offer more generous plans. This happens with Medicare Advantage- a program for all senior like Obamcare- when insurance companies advertise like crazy on TV with competitive plans during the signup period.  Unfortunately the converse occurred. Insurance companies felt (not sure if really true) they couldnt make money in the Obamacare enivironment and offered narrower and more expensive plans. Incidentally Trumpcare makes the same gushing statements about increased insurance availability without any guarantees.  Trumpcare could either follow the failure path of Obamacare or the success of Medicare Advantage.

The settlers get cheaper housing, security and the ultra orthodox men refuse to serve in the IDF to protect everyone.  Most secular Israelis can't stand them.  As to the Palestinians, they must share the blame as well for their and their neighbors' behavior.  The problem has no solution.  Bibi wants all the land to the Jordan River, the Palestinians want their capitol in East Jerusalem.  Nothing will work.

Bottom line - Trump has a simple mind.

Firing the head of the FBI while he is investigating this treason after you asked for his loyalty is obstructing justice. Then lying about all of this is perjury.

With Hillary, we can get the same 'ol same 'ol career politician crap that we've been getting for years. We get higher taxes, growth in spending, growth in national debt, and the big time lobbyist get to keep their control in the white house. Hillary, of coarse, gets to use her position of influence to make sure she continues to make millions of dollars. She can do this while lieing to the American public, because we all know she has no issues doing that.  Maybe, just maybe, she might strike it rich and sell some of our secrets to our enemies. That is a great revenue source. She can cover it up though, because she has great experience at that.

The deficits during Obama’s term were not from increased spending, but from the Bush/Obama tax cuts (and entttlements beyond anyone’s control).The sequestering held down expenditure growth even for the military. Obamacare did not add to the deficit because it was paid for by tax increases. Trump will increase spending, and his spending cuts will be offset by tax cuts, so deficit reduction will be difficult (which is why there are several conservatives objecting to Trump’s plan).

To judge from your post, probably not. The rest of us, though, will quickly see through his smoke and mirrors. He quite clearly lacks the political skills needed to steer his legislation safely through the approval process.

All documented.  Instead, she bought mansions in the Hamptons, and paid $5M for her daughter's wedding with those funds. Not to mention those 57+ people that went against her that are now dead, most by """"suicide""""  (a shot to the head).  Besides that, the lobbyists in DC are the scum of the earth, mostly represented by companies like Monsanto, etc.  Trump works for the People.  He takes no money from anyone.  Think about that.  The very fact that he takes so much heat from the totally corrupt MSM, and corporate establishment and RINO's, who are worthless parasites, should tell you something.  Trumps accomplishments so far tell the whole story. #MAGA!

0,"My post had nothing to do with the company's profit.  I was talking about the consumer.  They really are different issues.  Your scenario of the company keeping profits the same or potentially making more because of tax cuts offsetting the tax could be valid.  We will have to see.  There hasn't been much happening on the tax break front yet to allow a proper assessment of this.  What cannot be disputed because of basic math and economics is that the prices of the goods will rise, and the consumer will pay.  You also need to consider that higher costs to companies is correlated pretty closely with automation.  The higher the costs, the more incentive there is to automate if possible.  That usually means job losses or less job creation than anticipated.  Trump's assertions on this issue, at least those that he has said out loud in public, are deeply flawed.

1,"Thank you for bringing this topic up and I myself have inquired about the truth in a neutral way with male peers. You are entirely correct and frankly it's utterly ridiculous for anyone to assume Trump's comments about women are normal.

I want to believe that the majority of men in this country are higher and more dignified  than his repulsive example of Man, otherwise I think we'd be an entire country of overnight feminists!

0,"That's what's known as a false equivalence. Firstly: the republicans have been driving a combination of gerrymandering and voter disenfranchisment efforts - by their own admission - designed to prevent anybody who doesn't vote republican from voting at all, for years now. So a disproportionate number of potential Clinton voters were prevented through the only kind of actual electoral fraud that happens in the USA. Secondly - the evidence is that EVERYBODY who wanted to Trump went and voted, while the vast majority of those who didn't want him stayed home. Sure Clinton failed to inspire - and that was her biggest failure, I'm not disputing that, but she'd have been less unpopular today than he is. This is not actually unusual - for decades now the patterns has been that republicans win when turnout is very low, democrats win when it's high. Basically democrats lose when people don't vote. The evidence is that liberals outnumber conservatives in the USA by about 2 to 1.

I believe he knew full well from the beginning that there's no way either two big parties would step on big industry like that.

Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""""  Clearly Trump knew his fellow billionaire had the eye for “the younger” ones on the underage “side” of the law.

I somewhat disagree that we should (immigration is a national prerogative), but for the sake of argument let's pretend that yes, we have a role to play in this question.  The whole world already condemned & chastised Trump on this. Federal judges did, hell even a number of Republicans did. I don't think Trudeau following the same path changes anything from Trump or US perspective.  However, voicing clearly our perspective on the matter (which he did) without cutting the bridges (which we didn't) leaves the door open. If Trump struggles much longer in the court, he'll have to change track anyways... who will have more influence then? The wholesale chastisers or reasonable dissidents?

Trump tells Trudeau to bail on TPP, stop cozying up to Mexico , NAFTA dies then Trump offers Trudeau an FTA, or  re-invokes  the US/Canada FTA which preceded NAFTA and settles in to renegotiate that pact.  No matter, the Liberal performance to date has clearly shown Trudeau and his gang are not up to the task.

However, everyone knows that he not only didn't make the commitment in the speech at NATO -- he deliberately omitted the commitment that was in the original speech. So, No, of course, no-one will take this commitment seriously; or anything else he says; nor should they. Trump is notorious for not paying his bills. During the campaign, he tried to turn it into a policy position: we can reduce our debt by reneging on our obligations.  In his business career, he stiffed all sorts of people and companies, big and small; and if one of them had the audacity to sue him, he hired major law firms to beat them down. Then he stiffed the lawyers who did the dirty work for him. Now those same lawyers, and other big-time lawyers, don't want to work for him. Go figure.

Try as I might not to attribute motivation, it is difficult not to view Chaput as one of the most negative humans of his ilk, totally incapable of seeing the disconnect in his remarks and statements.  For example, he was furious that Notre Dame did not invite Trump to speak at their graduation saying that they passed on an opportunity for Trump to explain how his thinking on abortion has evolved.  Seriously?  And would that be followed by a talk on the sanctity of marriage from the thrice-married president?  His own guidelines for divorced and re-married Catholics, telling them they must abstain from sex prior to receiving communion, will forever stand as his personal monument to irrelevance.

Cultures in climates farther away from the equator had to not only fight for resource but also develop technologies to advance in the harsher conditions.  Seemed pretty interesting.

Your argument is specious, and can be paralleled by saying """"Why wouldn't a Republican attend a Democratic rally and shout out racial epithets to make the Dems look bad?"""" Sure, it's possible, but what proof do you have (besides your obviously lurid imagination) that the guy that shouted """"McCain ought to die"""" was in fact a Democrat. You're like the woman in """"Breathing Lessons"""" who threw her husband out because she dreamed he stomped on her needlepoint.

Canadian companies do not own the means of production. We are owned by the multinationals.  A high priced banana republic. You think global oligarchs didn't pick up some lessons from Marx?

The significance of Manafort to Mueller's investigation is that here we have a guy who helped a Russian-connected Ukrainian President to get elected. Manafort and Gates have connections to Russia and both end up on Trump's campaign team until Manafort got caught out. Donald Trump Jr and others have stated how much of the Trump empire's financing comes from Russia. Now we have the Russian-connected campaign team members for the Russian-financed Presidential candidate and we have Russians in possession of emails embarrassing to Hillary Clinton.

And his failure to come up with a viable alternative to Obamacare was a reflection of his lack of knowledge and leadership on policy matters. Ryan and McConnell wrote the legislation behind closed doors rather than holding open Congressional hearings. Trump was wasting his time golfing and watching television since it was an embarrassment for him to talk publicly or privately about the subject given how stupid he is. Trump bought his college degree. He did not earn it.  Trump is not inspirational and lacks legitimacy. Most of his opinions are driven from his racist point of view that blames immigrants, blacks, and Mexicans as the source of all troubles. So it is not surprising that he supports the Klan and its attempts to rename itself as the alt-right. And he failed to win the popular vote.

On January 10, 2017, CNN broke the story.  That's when Buzzfeed decided to publish the Steele dossier.  On Jan. 11, while Trump was denying everything at a news conference, the Wall Street Journal named Steele as the author of the memos and Steele went into hiding.

Yammering on about the popular vote is self defeating.  It's like saying the Carolina Panthers won Superbowl 50 because they had 315 total net yards vs. the Broncos' 194.

If he would have kept his mouth shut or encouraged the investigation up front, he would probably not have to worry about the broadening focus of the investigation.  Of course he lacks any real intelligence and kept putting his foot in his mouth over and over again. All his actions look like those of a guilty man. Now he is under an obstruction investigation, his son-in-law and members of his campaign are under investigation for financial dealings, and Pence is lawyering up.

She actually appropriated funds that belonged to the Party after fundraisers breaking campaign finance laws, again. How else do you think she had enough cash to funnel millions to the Russians to create dirt on Trump? The Party is over for the bathroom bullies of North Korea. Trump isn’t going to pay the little thug off anymore. That is a good thing since all of the previous Presidents gave us this nuclear North Korea. For all we know it is very possible that Kim Jong-un has used Hillary’s and Obama’s American Uranium to fuel his arsenal. China takes Trump very seriously because they live in the real world unlike Associated Press writers living in their politically correct version.

I do not impugn the opinion of the """"girlfriend"""" personally, I do not know her.  However, since I do not know her, I have no reason to believe her over her boyfriend.   A reasonable person should question which of two witnesses is telling the truth.  I believe that police and prosecution policies teach citizens how to resolve conflict.  When compliance trumps life in police action, when police or prosecutors do not respect all persons, citizens cannot help but conclude that lack of respect and use of force is okay in resolving their own issues.

People have flooded these countries like locusts changing everything in their path. These immigrants have no intentions of assimilating into their new locations. Plus they include terrorists .   Democrats dream of the same thing happening here , even though we don't have enough jobs and food for our own people. Donald Trump is the only one who promises to protect us and put America first .  If the average American saw what has happened over there and what will happen here too---they will reject Clinton . Trump should win by a landslide .  Trump may not be everyone's first choice , but he's the only one who can and will save America .  Look how diversity has hurt Anchorage . Lets make America great again . Vote Trump.

0,"The bitter, terrible irony of this period in American History is that, based on political affection, we have become a nation that can be characterized as a bunch of justice obstructors.  Those who claimed investigatory processes into Hillary Clinton should stop because of political agreement are no better than those who now cry loudly (see above and below) that Trump should be given a pass.  About 1/2 of our nation's leaders are doing and saying anything they can to undermine basic processing of criminal investigation (the newest?  """"the President cannot technically obstruct justice"""".  An argument that basically says the US Constitution intended the Office of President has dictatorial strongman powers).  The other half was arguing for stoppage during the previous Democratic  administration.  I get embracing a political view, party or candidate.  I don't get embracing, rationalizing, or most of all, trying to stop or obstruct simple investigation of potential criminal conduct.

Now, under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the DOJ is discarding these tools and doing away with the oversight provided by the courts.

True Clinton won the popular vote..but, she lost where it counted. You also missed a significant--but largely ignored by Democrats--statistic:  The Democrat party lost 900+ seats in state legislatures during the Obama administration. They now only hold 15 state governorships and in only 13 states do the Democrats still hold the governorship AND majority in the legislature.  Further, a look at the election map by country shows a sea of """"red"""" even in the """"blue"""" states.

0,"Actually, the dismantling of the ACA does not fulfill Donald Trump's campaign promise. He stated over and over again that he was going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something much better, much better and much cheaper. At no time did he say he was just going to undo it and toss millions of Americans into the ranks of the uninsured, which will certainly kill tens of thousands per year.  Once again, we have Trump lying to the American people. In fairness, this lie came out of his complete ignorance of health care policy (and a lot more). He wasn't helped by seven years of Republican lies about how health care access works. The reason the GOP had no alternative to Obamacare is because the only way to cover more Americans for less money is with single-payer, a non-starter for the GOP.  But that's all water under the bridge. Colin Powell's Pottery Barn Rule applies here: the GOP, especially Trump, broke health care access in America so they now own it.

My VA medical care has been more than acceptable, even with trips to Roseburg and, in a couple of cases, Portland and Seattle. Eugene's new clinic is a major improvement over the old River Road one, with the addition of more services such as a lab.  The Trump administration contains many people who want to privatize many aspects of our lives and the VA is one of them. Of course, like all human endeavors, it is not perfect. However, adding millions of vets to the non-VA medical system would overwhelm the already overloaded medical services industry.

Her judgment in the case of the private email server, her incompetent response when it was revealed, her withholding of information about her bout of pneumonia, and her misguided addressing of the party elite rather then the folks of the working class (among other foolish mistakes) all added to the paranoid clatter of the rabid right wing GOP'ers.  None of it, of course, were criminal in nature or intent, but it all went to feeding the dragon with Trump as its ugly, fire-breathing head.

Asia would be  safe from Japan for next 70 years.  Could history repeat itself? Today, the global aggressor is Corporate Capitalist West, led by the USA/UK. And PRNK has just tested its primitive H-bomb. West and Asia roles are reversed.  Could PRNK do the Japan-treatment on the West and give taste of their own medicine? Simply blowing two nukes near minor cities on Eastcoast US and South of UK will bring Trump/May aggressors to their senses, to sue for peace, because alternative is unthinkable.

He can wave a bible as a prop when campaigning in 'bible belt' country and when swearing himself in as president, but you can bet that a humble thought entered his mind. Rather, it was the thought """"boy I sure feel proud of myself now"""". The only torture Trump feels is when someone belittles him in whatever fashion, whether it's Obama over Trump's birthing idiocy or Clinton getting two million more votes than him in the election. Unless der fuhrer is bowed to constantly, he will go apoplectic. Naked power is what turns him on. Strong men like Putin are his heroes. The adoration which Hitler's men gave him is what he craves.

I personally know several non-racialized Canadians who haven't been kindly treated by U.S. border authorities. The U.S. has no obligation to allow entry to foreigners.

If you beleive Trump and his supporters are racists then I'm sure you beleive Hillary carries hot sauce in her purse as she said, or was named after Sir Hillary, or she was under fire in Bosnia. You supported a canidate who said Senator Byrd was her mentor, the same Byrd who was a Grand Dragon in the KKK? And you call us racists? You have been in fantasyland too long.  The Dem playbook of calling everyone opposed to their ideas racist doesn't work anymore.  The Dems have lost over 1200 elected officials since Obama was elected. America  has woken up!!

The unbiased reality is that """"wiretapping"""" doesn't apply today only to people stealthily attaching a tap onto a phone wire to listen in with headphones.  The term is used colloquially to mean any clandestine interception of communication.  Pretending to be ignorant of this use of the word, and taking Mr. Trump literally in order to ridicule him is something which I had hoped to be below the standards of the Globe and Mail.  The real story here, and I hope some journalists with integrity latch onto it, is the very specific denials issued by the politicians , such as """"I have no evidence of ...""""

But there are two more which battles in my mind as the most egregious.  It's a difficult choice but the lesser of the two is Trump's continued aggression that, as usual, leads him to jump on the political land mine with both feet when it could have been easily defused by just pivoting on what he 'actually meant' like he's done probably a thousand times now.  But no!  That isn't good enough.  Trump instead escalates his war on the media and the Constitution. What is worse than his incompetent assault on the Constitution?  His hypocritical sense of entitlement. He defends his choice to cyberbully others on the very right he now attacks that others have.

All unnamed sources, and in this case unnamed sources not from  within the intelligence community but with """"links"""" to the intelligence community. Heat Street seems to be part of Fox/Murdoch's empire. I confess I have never heard of them before. If this is the genesis of the Trump tweet tirade, this simply shows how Trump lies. I would strongly recommend everyone read this article and then try to connect the dots to Trumps tirade.

If that is not possible then we have no choice but to leave and start a genuinely progressive party.

I fully expect the Trump administration to take an axe to IHS.

Some IHS doctors are being put on part-time but receive full-time pay.

I'm again reminded, as I've mentioned several times in these threads, of the monumental import in 1933 of the intrigues of a small group of political actors that led to the unlikely installation of Hitler as Chancellor.

During this whole time nobody was offended to the point to demand the removal of these statues. This whole issues has been orchestrated by the people that want to remove Trump from power. Collusion with the Russians to win the election has failed to unseat him so this is the new tactic to incite the Right to create backlash against Trump and get rid of him .

Thus, the US is truly in a constitutional crisis.  3. It’s rich that the showboating Trump calls Comey, a metaphorical deer caught at night in a political headlight, a showboat.

How pathetic is that ?  All those who march in D.C. support killing the nearly born through abortion. Talk about a sick group .The bottom line is these marches will mean nothing . Locally this march will mean even less.  All these women would be better off to hold a bake sale and give all the money to Planned Parenthood who's about to lose all federal funding.

I highly doubt Trump is capable of humbling himself before rebellious factions in the Republican party which is only slightly more likely than humbling himself and trying to build consensus with Democrats to combat any faction within the Republican party. Trump surrounded himself with too many yes-men and not enough politicians because of his paranoid distrust of """"the establishment"""" and it came back to bite him on the butt with the ACA repeal and will continue to in the foreseeable future.

Trump will have to be careful that when they complete the wall that they complete it from the Mexican side, otherwise all these hardworking foreign workers will be trapped in the US with no way out since there will be no way in.

0,"Good article Laurence.  Actually, the 2016 Election probably reflects American Society more than any other election in my lifetime.  It has always been a myth driven, narcissistic society with a deep underbelly of racism.  That was kept under wraps from Kennedys and Johnson and even to Clinton and Bush the Elder, but it started to erode under Nixon with the Republicans Southern Strategy and was given more latitude by the Supreme Court selection Bush Jr as president despite all the shenanigans and vote rigging.  With Obama's win, the Republicans declared war and set lose the very white, very religious, un-liberal Tea Party which Trump was able to exploit with his racist and simplistic messaging.  Yes, the inmates have taken over the asylum, and until the more rationale Americans step to the fore with some enlightened principles and not just more games, the lunatics will continue to dominate and add even more extremists to the Supreme Court and key positions.

It is critical, however, that Canada cultivate trade and relationships beyond the US because we are currently overdependent upon the Canada-US relationship and this makes us vulnerable to bullying and induces too many of us to act on the assumption that we must curry their favour in all circumstances (or, alternatively, that we must be hypercritical of the US in all circumstances).  In short, especially now in the context of the new and unprecedented Trump Administration assuming office,  this is the time for Canada and Canadians to act like mature adults and avoid the 'colonial cringe' which too often colours our stance towards all things US.

He has basically called the CIA fools. What do you think the CIA is going to be doing for the next six weeks? Sitting on their hands and waiting for Trump to take power and humiliate them? Or find out exactly what happened in the election? I would suggest the later.  If the Russians did steal the election for Trump, and I don't know if they did, but if they did, you can bet the CIA will find out. And Trump will be denied.  Trump attacking the CIA while still technically a private citizen was a profoundly stupid move. A move he clearly made out of trepidation that he didn't really win the election. Understandable since he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million, but nevertheless a very stupid move.  This thing is far from over.

Trump has run a family real estate business as the only boss. He has filed bankruptcy six times despite the fact that Trump was heavily subsidized by US taxpayers and the federal government under US tax and bankruptcy laws. He has not run a large public business on the New York stock exchange answering to a board of directors, with a national or international management team where his performance is measured daily by the stock market.  As President, he has learned a lot and is turning away from his original policies (and supporters) and away from the right wingers (Steve Bannon) and toward the moderates and democrats in his cabinet-- Jared Kushner, Dina Powell, Gary Cohn, and Gernerals Mattis and McMaster (some of whom were supporters of Hillary). He has a long way to go yet, though, to match Obama even with support  in both houses of congress.

It is likely that Trump will have Republican control over both houses of Congress for the next four years.  An Oregonian can do little or nothing about that.

So the issue from the beginning has been God's preferential blessing on one nation over another.

1,"The fact that Evangelicals bought that load makes them seem backwards, bigoted, and sexist.  This is from someone who goes to church and helps in Sunday school.  Trump had to ask if the denomination he claims to be part of was evangelical.  He's on his third marriage and has cheated on his wives.  He was recorded making statements no evangelical should condone.  He lies as a matter of habit.  In every way other than some words, he's a very bad example to anyone's faith.  Even on the issue of abortion he's gone back and forth through time enough for anyone to know that he's pandering for votes on the issue.  Hillary isn't perfect either.  She's a better example than Trump in every way when it comes to religious principals. She's a life long Methodist with a history of policies to help families. Not all her policies align with Evangelicals it's true, but we live in a society that's made of of many groups.

If Trump is so """"irrelevant"""" why even attempt to see him.  LIar.  “What he’s been doing is a form of chaos that creates confusion and contention, which people track day after day instead of focusing on larger forces behind the scenes — like the banking industry, the military industrial complex or large corporations,” he said. “There are people who disagree with the way things are, and I’m just here to represent that in a peaceful way. I have children, and I’m concerned for their future as Americans.” - Littlechief.

Congress will still have to deal with the matter or give it a pass. Should the matter be given a pass, the voters will not forget during the 2018 election the failure of Congress to act now.

Trump's words have at times been un-Christian and at other times he will need to actually have to order to kill our enemies, just like Obama did and every other President before has.  The Bible says that the governing authorities are  God's sword to keep order and punish wrongdoing.

It is, if you want, first and foremost a character issue.  Anybody's character is debatable at the margins; everybody in public life has cut some corners.  But that is not what we face here.  We face a man who has repeatedly shown an inability to deal with palpable, provable facts if he deems them inconvenient.  A man who has lied repeatedly--and learned he can get away with it.

Donald Trump and the NRA will fight to defend the Second Amendment.  They will fight through the Court of popular opinion.  Through the media.  Through our Court System.  Hillary Clinton wants to abolish The Second Amendment.  She has pledged to do everything she can to nibble away at it.

Timber development is 50/50, as enviros get the blame but the worst enemy ever to logging on Federal lands was Republican John Sununu. Trump's non Republican response to selling off public lands my be due to the fact that his sons are hunters and the Republicans are selling public hunting lands like crazy in many states. Clinton has Ken Salazar as transition chief, so get ready Alaska for an increase in oil development on Federal Lands.

0,"[The Dems are continuing to undermine Trump, so that he doesn't have the political support to take timely and effective action against N. Korea.] What are you on about?  Trump's first choice was to flip-flop on calling China a currency manipulator and relying on China to stop Kim Jong-Un's nuclear and missile programs.  This was obvious back in February. http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/china-us-north-korea/index.html And carried on for over a month. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/13/trump-thought-china-could-get-n-korea-to-comply-its-not-that-easy/ Then the Trump administration compounds the issue by presenting a divided, muddled approach with no firm goals in mind with Trump first saying, """"We'll do everything"""" and Tillerson's """"not your enemy."""" As usual the problem with the Trump administration's foreign policy is with Trump's ham-handed approach.  It doesn't help any that the Moon admin in SK reversed, twice, on a missile defense system in SK.

It is a little unfair that nowadays there is free speech, but, appears to be limited to the liberal views and the conservative views are frowned upon. Example, why is it almost every time a conservative wants to discuss a stance at Berkley, the left side puts up such a position of threat that the speeches are cancelled. As wrong as these people might be to defend their positions, are we not excluding them from their rights to discuss their views? It always takes two to tango.

The founding fathers were quite concerned about getting a populist dictator that would recreate here the tyranny we experienced from King George.  Our government was specifically designed to protect minorities from rabid majorities.  What Trump seems to want is the founding fathers nightmare, to be a power hungry leader with total control of government to persecute and destroy enemies, like Putin has done in Russia.

0,"You see the problem here is that libbers judge Trump by their interpretations of his words rather than specifically by his actions.  Conservatives by an large restrained criticism of Obama to policy and actions such as ACA and bathroom rights executive orders.  Trump is maligned by libbers based on their interpretation of his words.  But in a man like Trump one must look at the big picture, the sum of all he says, not just one isolated sentence.  Trump does not live by the closely guarded standard of watching every word for potential offense.  Trump just talks.  I find that refreshing.  Others use the tendency to mine for quotes that can be construed one way or another.  By the way, I voted for Obama.  He mostly kept us out of war which is a major item in my agenda.  I am happy to wait for Trump to make policy at which point I will judge it.  Libbers are desperate to excoriate him based on his face, his voice, his style.  I deplore it.

It is also, ironically, likely to strengthen support for the very groups — ISIS and al Qaeda — that he claims he wants to defeat, given that nothing drives support for those groups like U.S. slaughter of civilians (perhaps the only competitor in helping these groups is another Trump specialty: driving a wedge between Muslims and the West).

You said that the bishop’s statement had been “clarified,” but you provided no evidence of “clarification.” You posted a link I could not follow; but even if I could have followed it, by your own account it would have shown only that the offensive material was not on the parish website.  Whether or not the material was ever on the website is not a relevant issue; it was a bulletin insert and may or amy not have been on the website. Your persistence in trying to distort the facts about this case leads me to believe that you’re just one more troll; a little more sophisticated than some, but a troll nonetheless. I was warned.

In true Trump fashion he jumped on a political landmine with both feet and attacked a gold star mother rather than simply admitted that he misspoke.  This was a golden presidential moment but Trump had to go and screw it up by making it political (Obama never did this) and verbally attacking a grieving mother.  I'd even argue that if Trump had just come out and said he was trying to follow Kelly's advice and script but misspoke the media would have actually been ON HIS SIDE just because of how sacred Americans hold gold star families.

Most Canadians haven't cared much. They loved America and almost all things American. Now they've turned against the US because when Hillary lost, they lost. Obama's failures were their failures. Take away Trump's impolite tweets against the establishment and his politically incorrect gaffes,  George Dubya Bush was even worse than Trump - for world peace, the environment, race relations, income inequality, unemployment. The global economy melted down under his watch. And Obama did little to reverse Bush's policies. The fact is it isn't Trump that brought the  US down to fascism and the world to the brink. The slide down has been going since WWII, under Republicans and Democrats. Except for a few years in the Trudeau era 1967-73, Canadians have done very little to oppose the demise of American democracy and world peace.

He grasps that firing Sessions would compound that jeopardy, but he has managed to delude himself into believing that if Sessions can be pressured to resign, Trump avoids the image of obstruction.  But this is pure delusion, since getting rid of Sessions is only a step to his objective to get rid of Mueller. The delusion continues, I figure, with the notion that if Trump's replacement AG were to fire Mueller rather than Trump, he would avoid the image of obstruction in attaining his goal.  Is it coincident that Trump utter determination to get rid of Mueller is associated with his """"red line"""" (Mueller investigating Trump finances). I am more and more inclined to the view that Trump's ultimate fear re Russia is the exposition of some sort of Putin financial stranglehold on Trump.  (Sure hope Mueller has his data backed up secretly offsite.

Carbon taxes here; no carbon taxes in the U.S. That, immediately, puts our businesses at a disadvantage with Trudeau unlikely to respond.

0,"Indeed. That whole episode was stage managed by the PR firm Hill and Knowlton.  This is nothing like that. Unless you are alleging a vast conspiracy featuring fake doctors and fake aid workers and fake dead people, I assume you accept the wealth of evidence that establishes that a chemical attack happened using Sarin gas that killed upwards of 80 people. According to many witnesses, the weapon was delivered by the Syrian air force. The story that a wayward rocket hit a weapons dump and released the chemical is farcical — in that scenario, the gas, which is stored in an inert state, would have been incinerated and rendered harmless. The attack was perpetrated by the Assad regime.  However, what is confusing is the Trump administration's response.  Up until the attack, statements from the administration indicated that they were giving Assad a free hand. I believe that is why the attack happened. What happens now is anyone's guess.

Has this blowhard ever heard of due process?  Or is he willing to toss all this out the door, something Islamist extremists would love, in order to fulfill some desire for revenge?  The way Trump has politicized this tragedy should really just dispel any notion there is a shred of human decency in this man.

0,"Trump doesn't have 'clearly defined' policies.  At best he has several sound bytes which resonate with some of his supporters.  That's how he got where he is today.  I haven't seen any 'solutions' from him yet, either.  I realize this offends your sense of political correctness, but that doesn't matter.  He is still succeeding long after the intelligentsia declared his imminent demise on numerous occasions.  He may still go down in flames, but he doesn't have to convince you of anything to still win the Presidency.  All he has to do is convince those who watch reality TV, World Wide Wrestling and the Beauty Pageants to vote for him.  And a few evangelicals, some good ole' Southern boys, those who haven't had a pay raise in over ten years while Hillary's sponsors have made billions, and those who mistrust the Federal government,    If he can convince some single-issue voters that he is their man on their narrow issue, he can still hear """"Hail to the Chief"""" on January 20, 2017.

0,"On most of the major geo-political issues, economic, military, and power, Trump is seemingly not all that different from Obama - America first in trade and jobs and patents, kill silently with drones from a distance, push China back to its own borders, try to control what is happening in different parts of the world, remain an empire, reinvest in major global corporations such as the automobile industry ....  Only on environmental issues was and is Obama very different, and much of that is because of the new technologies that allowed America to be come oil independent through fracking. It is easy to let coal go when oil is abundant.  Obama was and is more cosmopolitan, genteel,  and seemingly inclusive.  And Trudeau? Where does he fit in to all of this? A leader for a different and more inclusive and environmentally sound future, or, once again, a leader looking to hold on to current geo-political arrangements?  And the NDP? What do they profess? Who knows?

If any of you who support the Paris accord have AC, or have a dog it’s going makes it difficult for any participation to be taken seriously.  AC counts for 20% of all electricity cost.

Voters that only listen to one viewpoint over and over, without considering any other, can't consider themselves an informed voter.  It's not realistically possible.

The little white lies told by politicians and pundits -- we are used to them lying.  If you can accept that Trump tells lies that can be overlooked, then I disagree.

The American people will get the the politics and lawmakers they deserve. If they elect Donald Trump, and remember, they elected the clearly incompetent W., then the insane wars that follow, the division and misery, that will be on them. Me, I am going to stay close to the NYTimes, as their columnists have decided to focus on the real words and meanings of Trump.

0,"1) You're conflating two unrelated stories. The things you're talking about is related to his claim of being 'bugged' by Obama. He wasn't - but some of his conversations with Russians were caught in bugging those Russians. The only relationship between this and the investigation we're talking about is that those tapes may provide some of teh evidence used in this investigation. He, his administration and his campaign *are* being investigated. In fact no less than three separate investigations are happening. The house, the senate and the FBI are all investigating him.  2) Yes, I saw that poll when it came out, I still hold that the massive increase in subscriptions disprove the poll results. Polls measure opinion in the moment - but a subscription is a long-term financial commitment, much more indicative of your real beliefs rather than just your mood.  3) Don't bother. Trump is transparent and his real motivations are obvious and has been since day one. Trump is 1930s fascism reborn.

Obama and the Dems exaggerated what Obamacare would do and when problems started in the markets, they (and insurers) either did not see or tried to hide developing problems. Insurers are to blame, but they did not get subsidies they are entitled due litigation under a provision inserted by a Republican (Marco Rubio). The insurance companies are part of the market screwup in underpricing to get customers but worried about the subsidies they were not getting and which they thought might be stopped by Trump or Republicans. Dems failed to do anything to fix this. Now bill is too favorable to insurers and preexisting conditions and drug coverage are near gone.

0,"Trump’s habit of self-imposing -- then missing -- two-week deadlines for major announcements has become a staple of his administration as it’s struggled to amass policy wins. The president has used two-week timelines to sidestep questions from reporters or brag to CEOs at the White House. But his pronouncements have also flummoxed investors, Congress and occasionally even members of his staff. - Yeah, that's indeed how you know it's a lie. Somebody ask him about that new invisible flying Skittles-powered submarine the Navy said it would be delivering—he'll insist to your face that they told him they needed another two weeks.

He also would not be rushing laws deregulating everything that he could if he was an independent or a Democrat.  Also him giving tax breaks to the rich is another tell tale of the GOP basic requirements.  Trump is nothing more than a con artist and a Child in a Man's Body.

In his bubble there are neither lies nor truths only happenings which are of benefit to him.  Yes it is based on empirical data, all of which is provided by Trump himself.  We have seen him live in debates, endless nightlong tweets, we have recordings of him boasting of exploits of women, that he grabs them and kisses them at will, we have testimony from his ghostwriter and his biographer both disparaging Trump for his lies, frauds, and phonyness...3500 law suits against him, settled on his fraudulent unitversity.  It is not whether there is 'empirical data', but how much do you require.  Are you as fixed and resolute in your stubborness accepting Trump for what he says he is, as you are in accepting unchanging doctrine and dogma from the first few centuries over what science acclaims to be true.

Robert Mueller served the United States as a prosecutor working on cases including the prosecution of Manuel Noriega, mob boss John Gotti, and Pan Am Flight 103. He  sifted through the rubble of the Lockerbie bombing, including children's shoes and teddy bears. Robert Mueller served the United States as F.B.I. director, a position he accepted one week before 9/11. He served under two presidents from both parties, and had the longest tenure as F.B.I. director, second only to Hoover. Gingrich suggests that when it comes to Trump, however, Mueller is unable to operate objectively and is eager to abandon his integrity. Gingrich is acting like a surrogate stooge and should recall: """"Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.

Continuing to look for the three million fraudulent voters Trying to convince voters there was no interference by Russians in the election because Donald like Vladimir makes Howard Hughes   look sane.

It's comical to see how a fake fact posting like this can be high 5'd to the top of the comment thread.  No Mr Trump, Wa and OR get almost no power from coal. It has a huge excess of wind and hydro power that exports when it can for pennies on the dollar as well as a reliable 24/7 365 day clean and green nuke plant. BC could import many times the capacity of Site C for basically nothing long into the foreseeable future because state Renewable Energy Standards require massive builds of wind power that could be used to power BC, and keep its dams filled outside the summer freshet season.  BC already has a 40% surplus in electricity, due to IPP purchases. With the additional Wa state surplus, it has more than enough to convert the remaining gas heat and  transpo sectors to electricity with a shift to EV's and geothermal heat pumps.

1,"Obama was elected by a big majority and was a highly popular president among the majority. Obama is an objectively admirable person who acts through his Christian morality. tRump appeals to a shrinking minority and it baffles me how people who are probably not horrible people, like tRump is and has always been, support him.  I don't agree that most of his supporters are deplorable so that I wonder how you can look past his immorality, racism, constant lying, blaming, inflaming hate, division and incompetence. He is an embarrassment to our country.  You seem like a good person, Como, so why do you insist on looking the other way from the truth of who tRump really is and unfairly (and stupidly) vilifying Obama or Hillary.

Thus, the leaked phone call had nothing to do with Canada and everything to do with advancing Trumps confused but bullying relationship to all things Mexican.  Trump's reference to Canada in the call was made simply to try to convince the Mexican President that Mexico would be the focus & isolated in the upcoming NAFTA negotiations.  Think I'm wrong? Note the speed with which Trump turns against supposedly good friends or allies who he brings into his Administration.

0,"I think that this notion that Americans are stupider than they've ever been, and that a massive number of them don't care about the truth or expertise, is a bit overblown.  Sure Trump is a liar unlike any other we've seen in the White House. And we know that he is using lies for what he perceives as his political advantage. But sooner or later - and it may be a couple years away - Americans in large numbers will wake up to the fact that, no, their lives aren't better under this kind of inept leadership; in fact, with less access to health care, a lousier environment, bigger income disparities, poorer infrastructure, no jobs returning from Asia or Mexico, a country that has lost respect around the world and no end to terrorism in the US or abroad, America will clearly be worse off. We'll see what happens then, but let's not write off American common sense too soon.

Further, I don't pay much attention to the opinions about Canada held and/or expressed by expats. They've made their choice. And the views of foreign news outlets are largely irrelevant too. Were they following Canadian public opinion, they'd see that on many issues the Trudeau government has the support of only a minority of the population. Most Canadians haven't fallen off the proverbial turnip truck to blindly adulate the PM or his migration, diversity and/or globalization agendas. On several occasions, many Canadians have cringed at the antics of Trudeau and some of his ministers. And there's a much larger constituency for Trump-style policies than appears to be publicly acknowledged even if the U.S. president himself isn't broadly popular here.

No one is going to give Trump that kind of deal so he has to take it for himself.  There is no incentive for Trump or people around him to tell the truth because if they lie and if they did in fact collude they won't respect the supremacy of law, they will ignore it and attempt to dismantle any investigation, and pardon themselves if by a miracle charges are filed, acting like every political family before them did the same.

And that was before he was even sworn in. On the day of his swearing in he stood in front of the world and flat out lied about how many people attended - as if we hadn't all SEEN that he was lying. This is a president who lies habitually and actually seems to think that if he says it, reality must change to match what he said. Now, in the meantime - yes, this coverage over Russia is absolutely critical. As I've pointed out before - it took nearly 2 years from the breaking of the watergate story before Nixon was forced to resign and part of what allowed that to happen was constant press coverage.

0,"As one who participated in some of the homelessness alleviation activities, I am grateful that Eugene and Lane County have people who have worked so tirelessly to help homeless people. I watched as many people creatively summoned the funds and personnel to house a lot of homeless veterans.  As the troll class is impossible to talk to and reason with, especially because almost all of them refuse to come out from behind their anonymity, I just point out that they steadfastly refuse to be part of the solution, but instead delight in tearing down every effort to help the poor. They are like Trump, mouthy thugs who refuse to volunteer to help, treat elected officials like dirt, and delight in pain and suffering. There were lots of slots in the work to house homeless veterans...I wonder if even one took it upon him/herself to help out. Well, they set the rules of dissent during President Obama's time in office... Hugh Massengill, Eugene

I wish to take just a moment to reflect on the riots in Berkeley on Wednesday night.  Milo Yiannopoulos attempted to address a group on political/social issues.  However, another group of protestors/rioters stopped him through violence - pepper spraying a female attendee, attacking others, breaking windows, setting off fireworks, damaging street lamps, attacking police, breaking barricades...  Whether you agree with Milo or not, he has a legitimate right, under the First Amendment, to freedom of speech.  Yet, these protestors shut his speech down.  This is EXACTLY what the Nazis/Fascists did - using violence, the threat of violence, and riots to silence those who disagreed with them.  The left has become that which they purport to oppose.

Fewer and fewer people pay any attention to his twittering.  When you can't even maintain a respectable level of twittering interest, you've become a failed has-been.   And this will just give him heartburn.  Trump's most retweeted post was retweeted 82,000 times.  Obama's most retweeted post was retweeted 940,000 times.  He will positively lose sleep over that.

I will not support anyone or anything that stands between me and my country.  The Twenty-Fifth Amendment contains language pertaining to removing an individual from the presidency if he/she is deemed incompetent or a threat to US security.  Donald Trump has already demonstrated that he is both.  I will support all those who work to invoke this amendment because my country means more to me than any politician.  The seriousness of what is going on cannot be understated.  This is about America's survival.

I understand he is bringing his former ambassador to the US during the NAFTA talks, Derek Burney, to this cabinet committee meeting.  Burney is one smart cookie and will also add value to this important meeting.

0,"I just want to point out that the people of Louisiana had the option to vote for a white supremacist (David Duke)  for the senate this year, and only 3% did so, while 58% voted for Trump.  That's the same percentage that voted for noted racist Angela Kaaihue here.  I grew up there in the 80's and 90's, and its not like you remember.  It's still far more segregated than Hawaii and there is a widespread mutual distrust between races in a general sense, but individuals do tend to give individuals of the other race a fair chance.  I think the Democratic Party's methods of preaching victimhood is far more damaging to the South's blacks than the Republican party or any white supremacist remnants.

He did an ok job pointing out that she (establishment) has had many years to address this country's issues and the results are pretty clear.  Did she speak better than him? Yes. Was she more willing to go negative? Yes. Was she more polished in her sound bites and better prepared? Absolutely.  I guess that makes her the """"winner"""" of the debate.

0,"The North Koreans, and I mean the entire population regardless of leadership, hates the U.S. because of what it did to them since 1952. That war killed about 2.5 million NK, 0.5 million SK. WW2 style carpet bombing aimed to exterminate, as Trump now threatened to do again. Since 1954 there were many conflicts short of war including NK capture of American spy ships.  The American, and by that I mean only those who run the American global empire, hates NK because it succeeded in stopping American conquest. Because it dared to develop a credible conventional and nuclear defense against the next Korean War, which would have started already otherwise. This is very bad for a big empire as arrogant and military as the U.S. It raises the question of its umbrella over its de facto colonies and protectorate South Korea and Japan.  The problem with DPRK for U.S. is there is nothing there worth fighting over and plunder. No oil, gas, they don't use the dollar anyway. NK cannot be converted.

But knowing that you’ve shown some strange phobia’s, and have written some off-the-wall comments here, I paused, and read you’re comment again. And by giving you the benefit of the doubt I decided that you’d simply misspelled “Trumpphobe”. So I searched the RG for  “William (Chico) Schwall”, and found the four letters I mentioned.

Hillary has been, according to the FBI, extremely careless with sensitive, classified information. So careless that if anyone other than Hillary were to do the same, they would find themselves charged, convicted and doing a rather large amount of time in prison. I would be just as concerned about a republican doing the same things. Most republicans were actively supporting impeachment of Nixon. Republicans supported Gingrich resigning until it was found that he did nothing illegal or wrong. I have a very large problem with anyone who lies about anything and everything, over and over and do not care what party they are from, Trump included. I know that most politicians lie about a whole lot but Hillary takes lying to a whole new level.

His family could stand to gain a lot due to their numerous real estate businesses and dealings,  via numerous partnerships, limited liability companies, S corps, etc., aka pass through's.   If Trump releases all of his relevant tax returns, he could prove that they would not benefit significantly from the 15% pass through income provisions.

0,"Historians call the popular telling of Galileo's story the Galileo myth, for a good reason. The popular telling is a very simplified version concocted by a couple of atheists in the 19th century in order to make religion look bad.  The gist of it, was that the university philosophers of that time were largely secular and subscribed to geocentrism. Galileo's observations challenged that prevailing belief, and thereby pretty much the entire scientific establishment of the time, and not the church. Galileo could not provide direct evidence for heliocentrism yet he taught it as a fact, which riled academics up. Galileo also had an incredible knack for making enemies, on purpose. The guy was a 17th century troll. Insulting the pope, the church, and the scientific establishment, resulted in trumped up charges of heresy being supported by just about everyone. The guy was under """"house arrest"""" at a fancy villa, and wrote his best work there. All thanks to the his friend the pope.

1,"Trump's ascension was a direct result of Tea Party, evangelical, and white backlash against disorderly Blacks, Mexican immigrants, a decline in sexual mores and rise of gay marriage. It has been harbored and nurtured as anti Obama and anti woman (especially Hillary Clinton) hate. But most important, it has fostered a hate for the poor, the disabled, the homeless, the sick, the aged, and anyone else in need. These needy folk have been disowned as """"unworthy"""" of our concern and suffering from self-inflicted troubles. There is then no mercy - it is their fate until they pray themselves up from their own boot-straps.

Hollywood makes big bucks off of s-e-x.  Why? Simple answer. Sleaze sells.  Movies like """"Indecent Proposal"""" (1993) have raked in millions and they are almost always based on some kind of sex act or adultery in motion. Nothing heartwarming like """"It's a Wonderful Life"""" anymore. Just  violent passion that has replaced good acting,  and Trump was right... in Hollywood the behavior he described is unfortunately all too normal and accepted. Women are treated as 'objects' and we all know it.  Until someone like yourself agrees Hollywood needs to clean up its act, your moral outrage over Trump has little, if any, credibility.

0,"I understand while Putin and Hillary Clinton just didn't like each other.    But I see nothing in the article that implies Clinton did anything to affect the Russian election, nor did she arrange for the Russians to help her in the American elections.  It seems clear that Clinton never had any 'arrangements' with Putin or the Russian goverment to influence elections.  She did say the elections were rigged in Russia(AFTER the results), which was obvious to most and hardly the only voice in the international community that said the same thing.  I see no equivelency between the coopertive arrangement of the 'profit centered' Trump, both as a private contractor, now as the POTUS and the Russian Oligarchy, (including Putin) and the not too subtle animosity between Clinton and Russian Policy (and I suspect a personal dislike of the chest baring macho authoritarianism of Putin).   I can't image two more opposite personalities  If I missed something in the link, please correct me Mot.

This would leave millions of patients who seek services from the organization (2.4 million to be exact) without care.  This fact is completely unimportant to the Republicans.  After all, to them, what’s another few million people without care—especially when Trumpcare will increase the ranks of the uninsured by 22 million?

0,"That's what Christine Lagarde of the IMF is saying is the solution to the problems caused by globalization.  I think Trudeau has said something similar about globalization.  The big problem of course, is that the governments of Europe, Canada and the US have no desire or will to use the money for social spending and to create jobs.   They've had 20 years to do something but they haven't.  No, Trump is doing the right thing.  He's cutting taxes and the cutting the cost of regulations to preserve profits and he's creating millions of high-paying new jobs to make any price increases more acceptable to workers (tax cuts there as well).  It's a bold move, but times like this call for bold moves.  Nobody wants a trade war, just a better deal.

0,"It’s easy to get caught up in the deeply flawed character of Donald Trump. We also need to recognize the policy catastrophe of this presidency.  This past week Trump ordered an end to the Obama-era executive action that shielded around 800,000 young undocumented immigrants – often called Dreamers – from deportation under what’s been known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.  Look at other of Trump’s recent policy decisions and you see the same arbitrary and unnecessary cruelty. What’s the point of banning transgender people from military service? Of siding in court with a businessman who doesn’t want to sell his services to gay couples? Of weakening the standard for responding to sexual violence in universities? Of banning Syrian refugees and reducing by half the number of refugees admitted to the United States?  There is no point, in terms of policy. None of these decisions makes America safer or economically stronger or fairer.

Trump's riled up mob of angry town folk, a vocal minority, are more motivated but winnowing as his caveman shtick wears thin vs the weak candidacy of Clinton that will grow slightly with fears of Trump. If Trump is still his own worst enemy and Clinton can up the charm factor as she has in the past, plus be the stable mind in the mix then she'll secure voters despite the grey areas that are fogging things up.

It often seems that after an attack, the muslim community all over the world is silent or throwing up chaff by using other extremists (i.e supremacists whom no-one before trump ever took seriously anyway.)  I understand the muslim community suffers greatly from racism and stereotyping after each attack in N. America and Europe. Framing terrorist portrayals in news and movies doesn't help either. But really, one wonders, if muslim people feel they are so very far removed from the religious extremes of ISIS - tacit silence is not the same as standing against something - demonstrate against ISIS in the streets of North America as is your democratic right and I will believe you.

Indeed, as angry Catholic Trump voters start dying off, Purgatory will need a new wing. The Marriage decrees are valid, however they are still wrong and unscriptural if you accept that the debate between Hillel and Shammai must be considered. Francis is tempering the severity of Trent, but more needs to be done for charity and sanity. The Calender is a temporal question and it could yet change again civillly without the Church having a say.

He also increased spending by significantly more than any increase in revenues with a defense buildup and no significant cuts to any domestic programs (I guess Trump and the GOP are doing a little better this time since they voted to cut Medicare by almost half a trillion dollars to fund this tax cut for the wealthy).  The other thing that was going on was that the FED under Paul Volcker had raised interest rates to quell the high inflation rate by plunging the economy into what was then the deepest recession since WWII.  Once the FED relented on the high rates along with Reagan's hyper Keynesian fiscal policies the economy took off and tax revenues rose.  You may have a bias in thinking that the only or biggest reason was cutting taxes but there are two other explanations that are more likely to be responsible.

All those war veterans who chose to support him, certainly have the right to choose even if it flies in your face.  It is unlikely that Trump thought up the birther movement.  Maybe Clinton did, I don't know.  But I do know that natural-born citizen is a constitutional requirement and every citizen is right in asking a Presidential candidate to prove they satisfy it.  Obama's refusal to display his birth certificate or to otherwise prove that he satisfied the constitutional requirement allowed the birther movement to flourish.  A little bit of proof would have killed the movement instantly.  So I conclude that Obama himself helped create the birther movement.  (Note that being born physically in the US is not necessary to be a natural-born citizen.  Perhaps the media is also responsible for the birther movement since simple constitutional explanation would have killed the movement as well.)

There is a huge difference between a society approving and encouraging something, and a society tolerating something, and a society feeling helpless to stop something.

0,"Supporting abortion is a term of art. It is not just allowing abortion to be legal (as if Catholic politicians had a choice, even about judges, because vehemently pro-life judges are usually inferior legal thinkers). It is taking the position that abortion is a positive good that society should encourage. Some zero population growth Greens actually take that position, but it is individual, not a requireed party plank. The right to abortion is part of a larger right to engage in conduct that the legislature has no business regulating in a free society. Not wanting a theocracy, even a Catholic one, is not a requirement of the faith. Sadly, Pelosi and Biden have done nothing to educate the hierarchy on why Roe says what it says. Doing so publicly may alienate some Catholic voters, but probably not the amount they fear.  Again, abortion has nothing to do with DACA except as a barometer of who Trump will pader to and why.

0,"It's an attack now to notice subtle language reinforcing certain political biases on an almost subconscious level? If we really wanted to talk about attacks, the character limit didn't even let me get to Saunders' apparent praise of NAFTA, the end of which might be the one silver lining to Donald Trump's otherwise abhorrent presidency.  As for dual citizenship, I don't have a problem with that at all and never weighed in on the issue here. Canada is shaped by an interesting way of balancing multiculturalism, which finds a distinctive character in our diverse cultural and political inheritances. As a son of an immigrant and with a genealogy that looks like a StatsCan demographic report, I was shaped by Canadian multiculturalism. Consequently, I consider anything a positive which enriches our cultural fabric - like our Queen and free movement across the Commonwealth - while despising anything that impoverishes it, like selling us out to the clearly dysfunctional American system.

As John Laughland noted (« Conflit en Ukraine : Kiev a intérêt à aggraver la situation », 2 February) OSCE observers clearly indicated that it was the Kyiv government responsible for violating the ceasefire, obviously with a view to creating problems for President Trump. PM Trudeau should end our training mission in Ukraine. Whatever justification for it there may have been before obviously no longer exists given the reckless behaviour of Ukraine’s ruling kleptocrat. Defence Minister Sajjan’s sabre-rattling against Russia was grossly irresponsible when a tough love approach to the Ukrainian government was surely what was called for. Russia is hardly blameless in this conflict, but was not responsible for this flare-up. Like most of Trudeau’s cabinet picks, Sajjan is not living up to his advance billing.

It is not the ground or underground bunker penetrating bomb. The concussive effect can be used near the openings of tunnels but there are other effective bombs for this purpose. Commanders have preferred smart accurate directed bombs that can strike more accurately-- dropping 100 smart bombs can achieve more military effect than one of these.

He sheds public policy positions and political staff and subordinates with cynical abandon as he strives to keep off balance his opponents (i.e. domestic and foreign figures with whom he is competing) of the moment in whatever transactional enterprise in which he currently engages.  The only constants are a need to be able to define the current agenda, bend others to his will and be acknowledged a 'winner' in each transaction he chooses to undertake.

Racism or sexism has nothing to do with it.

So Beria got removed by Trump.  tch tch.  Or was that Kruschev?  No matter.  The Asst AG  was only approved by the Senate in the last couple of weeks.  He was in place to see Comey testify that  he was not sure of what to do.   AG Sessions  told POTUS that Comey was not competent to lead the FBI to  a fair, just,  impartial end.  Both  AG and deputy recommended he be replaced.  That is not unusual for a new government seeking change.  If the FBI is not capable of continuing or expanding the probe into Russia, Trump,  and election issues,  it has been sorely wounded by the past administration and by Comey himself.  Trump acted correctly.

0,"Alberta is not in a better position that Ontario. The Alberta government is spending many millions of dollars to tell us on TV and radio how good our carbon tax is for us.  It is actually a 30% tax, while Ontario's is 19% (if it is actually possible to calculate this correctly). Alberta is also supposedly giving rebates to 66 % of residents, which essentially is an expensive way to tax the rich.  In both provinces, the tax is regressive and anti-business. Trump is laughing at us all.

Many of these are so simple to verify a kindergartener can see through him.  Earlier this week he claimed he's accomplished more in his short tenure in office than nearly any other president.  Wow.  Just, wow.  Every single day it's like that with Trump.  For all of Hillary's faults - and there are/were many of them - it floors me that Trump supporters continue to look the other way on his faults which are 10x more and worse than Hillary's.

It is where the people living around these small places, too small or too far away from major highway that even Walmart doesn't bother to open a store there, shop and buy daily used cheap knick knacks.  If a 35% tariff is imposed on Chinese products, these people is going to get hurt.  And people in these economic depressed places are the strong Trump supporters.  Jobs that promised for them aren't that easily materialize because the cause of the job loss in these region is more complicated than one cause - China.

He has no political philosophy, ideals or goals, he simply wants high ratings about himself in the media, see himself on TV, and he will associate with whatever party or else will help him increase his popularity.

Without that  information, this story is incomplete.  An internet search shows that the 2014 case resulted in the decision to deport Ortiz.  He requested and was granted a stay, for more time to pursue legal means of residing in the U.S.  In November 2016, he applied for another temporary stay for more time to pursue his case. So, the Obama administration originally intended to deport him, but gave him 2 years to obtain legal residence. The two years had run out and he requested another stay.  The above information changes the complexion of the story.  It was not that the Trump administration randomly picked on Ortiz, as Judge Reinhardt's quote may suggest.  His case had already been decided, he was given time to overturn the verdict, but time ran out with no verdict overturned.  Unfortunate for him.

0,"Actually, Obama's policies were quite successful at turning around the disastrous policies of the Bush administration, at least to the degree that this was possible (e.g. the middle east destabilization). People are voting for change in the US, it's true, but almost half the population didn't bother to vote at all and the majority voted for Clinton, not Trump. This isn't some sort of movement toward the """"policies"""" proposed by a fascist, it is apathy and frustration with the fact that we are living through a time of great disruption, primarily brought about by technology, not policy. Pretending the past is coming back is foolish and naive. Couching this lust for the past in rascism is the opposite of a solution.

Bin Laden's reply was,  """" A community organizer........and (gasp!) a woman......they call her Hillary.""""   One of the 72 virgins asked where Trump was.

0,"Wow man, you are working on a very grim and sad level. On every level, getting in the ring with Trump now is like coming out of the closet as a Sith Lord. I hope you're being paid well for your publicized courtship with evil.  Let's just start with the children: 'hey daddy, why does he talk like that about women and minorities, isn't he the president? Is the president allowed to grope me? Is it an honor?'

Nothing exposes the total and complete lack of any ethic or mores in the right wing than to look at their actions in the face of a reality they'd just as soon not face. . Valueless hypocritical liars. .

0,"I understand that living in the reality of today's American political world usually comes down to 2 choices. I understand how people feel such hatred towards the Clintons, but I don't accept it. I was taught from a young age, that civility ALWAYS mattered MOST, in EVERY walk of life and profession. It is what sets us apart as human beings, having the self-awareness of self control for our own actions and words. Have voted for as many R's as I have for Ds in my life, but put a gun to my head and I have to vote Dem. this time. If Trump would have run as the Independent he really is, I'd have some respect for him. He's made a mockery of the R party. I don't want him making a mockery of the U.S. for the next 4 years. The world respects us more then it did 8 years ago. I don't want to see us slide back into the Bush 2 years. """"Compassionate Conservatism"""" & """"Make America Great Again"""" are code words. The 1st doesn't exist and the latter gives racists & bigots an excuse...my opinion of course.

0,"Look at the facts and ignore the """"fake news"""". First, look at the US Supreme Court brief that Jeff Session and the Solicitor General's office prepared-- the point they make about ignoring the President's previous statement's and tweets and the fact that becoming the US President has changed Trump-- Second, now look at Trump's tweets where he reverses direction to his campaign promises and rejects the position that Sessions had recommended for him demeaning it as political correctness. Look at George Conway's tweets on Trump-- pointing out how they weaken his case and calling the situation of Sessions, the SGO, and the Justice Department doing a good job and getting stabbed in the back and insulted by Trump, """"sad"""".

0,"Trump's grandchildren can't inoculate him against the anti-Semitic tone of his campaign and his Presidency. His top advisor ran an blatantly anti-Semitic website. Trump ran campaign ads with imagery lifted from anti-Semitic websites. His statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day failed to mention Jews. At a press conference, he called Jake Turx, a Jewish journalist a liar and told him to sit down and then, ignoring Turx's question about whether he would condemn the wave of anti-Semitic attacks, bragged about his election. He was silent for so long after the recent wave of attacks that even his own party was questioning the silence. Finally, instead of condemning the attacks, he tried to protect his white-nationalist supporters and blame the attacks on someone else, as if he was accusing imposters of trying to make anti-Semites look bad. At Trump rallies, his supporters taunted members of the press with chants of """"Judenpresse.""""

0,"One suspects that mass dementia has infected the country. Remember, three weeks before Trump took office, Obama deployed thousands of troops, tanks, nuclear capable missiles, and an entire air wing, right on the Russian border. It was a deliberately provocative act, with predictable reactions from the Russians. Trump, and his aides, were deliberately drawn into attempting to defuse a dangerous situation. With NSA and CIA operates in place, taping phones for the """"leaking"""", it was a cynical, dangerous, flat out insane, gambit to destabalize the Trump government. It was, also, treason. And, the scheme apparently involves a number of high ranking Democrat Party officials. The press is out running down rabbit trails instead of covering a breathtaking story on Machiavellian politics.

See: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/14/china-silk-road-trade-train-rolls-london  What great timing for China as Trump turns inward. They are expanding their railway network into Europe and other countries to ship goods. If the US attempts to blockade the SCS, the Chinese have another route to carry on their trade while they go to war with the US.  Our mutual funds, stocks of various Canadian and American companies, our pension funds are heavily invested in enterprises involved in the China trade. The components that go into various widgets we build here are majority sourced from China.  If the costs of the building components that go into various widgets raises, our companies here are at a disadvantage. Profits to the bottomline will drop. Share values drop. Our retirement nest egg shrinks.

0,"I posted because I found it amusing that partisan supporters of Hilary were complaining that Trump was doing what Hilary did, which I find hypocritical.  I have taken partisan positions, but not on US politics, since I am not American.  By the way, I am impressed that you can see my comment history about American politics, when I can't even see it myself.

Pence obviously didn't want some of Trump's positions understood or believed, especially as Trump """"articulates"""" them. Good heavens! What a """"running mate""""!!!

0,"What gets me is the speed with which Putin has run rough shod over the rebels in Syria since Trump's declared victory. Putin expects no retribution for massacring thousand of soldiers and innocents. This is hard to believe as the US actually supported the rebels with arms etc. and has now left them to genocide. It amazes me that Trump supporters are giddy over the new Thermonuclear device race to Armageddon. Happy New Year! It may be our last.

0,"Whether this bombastic shouting match between Trump and Kim Jong-un comes to missiles or not - the US is losing another leg of its power on the world stage. And the Chinese are stepping into the vacuum.  The US is so overshadowed by The Donald making inane pronouncements while on his latest golfing holiday that we don't even have a face of US diplomacy and engagement.  Instead we have China taking the lead role in diplomacy and attempting to avert war.  Some Americans are talking """"regime change"""".  America couldn't get that right with former CIA asset Saddam Hussein in a country where US, UK and France had direct air control for over a decade.  But they think US can slice out Kim Jon-un from his mountain bunkers in the hermit kingdom about which the US knows less than nothing.  All eyes on China because the USA is having one of its increasingly periodic bouts of crazy.

0,"Were you in business before 2008?  So funny that some of you """"new and small"""" business owners think that it is the Dems fault for your costs. So, how did Bennett vote to hurt you?  How did Cory """"lower medical premiums and deductibles""""?  Hint - He didn't!!!  If fact, he would lower those premiums by making them unavailable. Elimination of access lowers costs!!!  Bush didn't help you even though that was his platform and tRump isn't going to help you either.  I was a small business owner and I know that paying for both sides of SS and other costs are hard but this is not a fault of Democrats (that you low information, easily manipulated right wingers just love to blame).  All they care about is BIG business - the kind that can give massive donations.  You and your small business are tRump change.

0,"Part A Ms. Heineman, I have no desire to debate you.  A debate implies two opposing sides with firmly established positions and opinions.  A debate also implies a winner, and therefore, a loser.  I'm sick to death of the zero sum game it seems all politics have become.  President Trump's winners/losers divisions, the goal of """"win at all cost,"""" the idea that if """"A"""" wins, """"B"""" must lose an equal or greater amount...I'm sick of it.  It seems that there are no organizations - not the NRA, not the Brady Campaign, not Congress, not the two major parties, not the executive branch - and (in my experience at least,) few individuals that are interested in an open, honest, respectful, wide-ranging dialogue addressing this problem. My posts were simply an attempt to point out that there are no simple, black-and-white solutions.
