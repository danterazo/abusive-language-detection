0,"President Trump is beginning his term with a 36 percent approval rating over his first five days in office, according to a new poll released Thursday. The Quinnipiac poll shows that 44 percent of American voters disapprove of Trump's presidency so far, with another 19 percent who are undecided.

0,"I hope that people can start to avoid or forget many stereotypes.  Also there is the problem of names. """"Protestant"""" is something of a negative term since it is defined as an antonym.  Another historical replacement term should be """"reformed"""", which is not so hostile.  I see the day where the main Christian bodies still exist but people float between them without hostility are contempt.   And excellent example of such to my thinking is Vice-President Elect Mike Pence. He has sometimes called himself an """"Evangelical Catholic"""". He never disowned his Catholic roots, even being formerly in some lay ministry as a Catholic. He says he had some needs so he went elsewhere, looking for support for more intimacy with God that he craved. I do not think the term """"protestant"""" would appeal to him.
"
0,"I've noticed some selective reporting and omissions of key facts on the part of the Globe and Mail in some of their reporting.  Most recent example I can think of was a report on John Furlong. Globe and Mail's reporting made it seem like there were still some unanswered questions as to his guilt or innocence, when the  facts have been established in the BC Supreme Court that one of his accusers was never even at the school where the alleged abuse took place, and another had already accused another man and had been previously compensated for said allegations. The Globe & Mail never made one mention of any of these established facts and instead made it seem like the accusers had still not received justice, despite being found to be bald-faced liars.  So, yeah, the Globe and Mail likely doesn't engage in """"fake news' but they sure do manipulate, omit and selectively report the facts in a lot of their stories.

0,"If liberals are so concerned about slavery they should protest in the middle east, china, southeast asia and the african continent.  There is plenty of slavery going on there right now.  But, they won't go because they are cowards who's goal it is to destroy America and everything it stands for.  Let me remind the liberal nitwits that it was America who led the world in the elimination of slavery.  First vermont in 1777.  Then The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807.  1862 - U.S. President Abraham Lincoln proclaims emancipation of slaves with effect from January 1, 1863; 13th Amendment of U.S. Constitution follows in 1865 banning slavery.

0,"This service was incredibly well put together.  The passion of the speakers- from Gov. Walker to the men who served with Sgt. Brandt made it clear what a great guy Sgt. Allen Brandt was.  The massive participation from the community today and the hundreds of men and women from the public safety community demonstrated what Alaskans value.  As we go forward we need to heed what we heard today from the police officers who spoke- Phil McBroom, and Sgt. Allen Brandt by a video recording made during his testimony at a recent Fairbanks City Council meeting.  McBroom spoke of the catch and release criminal justice system in Alaska- made weaker by SB-91.  McBroom noted some criminals can be arrested as many as three to four times per shift as they are continually released on their own recognizance.  One of those career criminals was a man who viciously attacked and shot Sgt. Brandt.

0,"Far from """"draining the swamp"""", Trump has filled the swamp with the greediest rats he could find, he being himself the greediest and most corrupt of the bunch. He has a stable base of support, but even that is showing signs of erosion in the latest polls. More troubling, at this point, most Republican office holders still seem willing to tolerate his corruption, incompetence and instability in the hope that they will pass and he will sign a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of wealth-holders under the guise of a """"tax cut"""" or """"tax reform."""" 80% of the money saved in tax cuts will go to the top 1%, while the deficit-hypocrites will gleefully (but as quietly as they can) allow the deficit to increase in order to move that money to the very top. Despicable. In many ways, Pence will be worse. Trump built his political career on the racist theory of birtherism; Pence built his, to a great extent, on gay-bashing. Worse, as an enabler of Trump, he has demonstrated no integrity.

I don't think they have the right soothing tone.  She doesn't believe the church will ever change.  They have a vested interest in the status quo.  Besides, you never ask the people who created the problem to change it.   They would have to admit they made a mistake.   Not going to happen.  At least according to Sister Catherine!
"
0,"Porkfat, The Heller vote was 5-4, meaning that 4 justices opposed the decision, and I agree with them.  Every word in the Second Amendment has an effective meaning, but the majority relied on linguistic trickery to render the first half of the Second Amendment superfluous.  In the opinion of the majority, the elimination of the first half of the Second Amendment does not change its meaning at all.

1,"The article fails to mention that there is a massive dose of present-day political indoctrination contained in the recommended replacements for the classical literary works in question.  The novel titled """"Indian Horse"""" centres on a Canadian First Nations boy who survives the Indian residential school system without getting murdered there by the white man who ruined everything for native folks.  The book titled """"Stone Thrower"""" centres on a black man spending time in 1970s Canada and the USA trying to succeed in a career but who is kept down by the white man, and his black daughter growing up in 1990s Ontario and the racism she faces in the high school cafeteria and reflections thereof, comparing racism in modern America to racism in modern Canada, the white man ruining things for visible minorities.  Visible minorities good. White man bad. The social justice warriors must be ecstatic with these choices. Next up in literature class: Pin the tail on the racist white man.

Sessions cited “a fallacious national crime wave and linking it to immigration.”  “Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin publicly criticized Sessions for spreading falsehoods about crime, stating that Sessions attempted to mislead a meeting of state attorneys general.”  Sessions “ordered the federal government to back away from police oversight measures, such as the consent decrees that have effected real reform in many cities.”  Former Attorney General Eric Holder “referred to Sessions’s approach as ‘dumb on crime.’”

0,"Once again the politicians and the drug protectors fail to see a real villain. Over 30,000 people a year die from a legal drug...tobacco. We do nothing but put ads on packages at the taxpayers expense. These smokers drain our health care system and leave many families without parents. Yet we are focused on a few hundred junkies who knowingly choose to inject drugs. Yes the smokers chose their path but the government made it easy by having tobacco as a legal product....so the deaths and the cost don't matter.

"
0,"I appreciate MSW approval of Salt + Light - even if comparing it to EWTN doesn't set a very high bar.  However, to give Rosica so much credit is not accurate.  Salt + Light was the """"baby"""" of a Sicilian immigrant to Canada who arrived penniless and made good.  It was Gagliano who pitched the idea to Rosica (an American born priest working at the University of Toronto) in 2002 because Gagliano liked the way Rosica oversaw the World Youth Day held in Toronto in 2002.  Gagliano had studied at a seminary and been influenced by Fr. James Alberione about using mass media to spread God's word.  It was he and his family who provided the funds and S + L was launched in 2003.  Gagliano remained active in its formation until just before his death in 2016.  My fear is that now Gagliano is gone and the obvious involvement of the Supreme Council of the K of C - given the name of the new studio and who was in attendance ... it might go the way of EWTN.  I hope and pray not.

0,"I believe most attorneys will tell you that litigation is a last resort: it's the step you take when an agreement seems impossible.  One of my professors used to tell us that when you see a case go to trial, it usually means the attorneys failed.  While I think that statement may be a bit over the top, it does carry a lot of truth.  The point of my post was really just to take umbrage with this emerging language from the bishops that seems to want to rewrite history, and to position the church's leadership as being a leader and a model for the rest of the world when it comes to the handling of abuse.  As I see it, they have a VERY long way to go before they can claim that mantle.  I also suspect this is not an accident:  this theme is emerging   simultaneously in more and more statements by bishops worldwide: the bishops want to rewrite history. I find this rather disturbing.

They will not generally make anything close to the salaries of corporate executives - a kleptocratic class if there ever was one - and certainly can't usually fall back on inherited wealth.

Unfortunately, the courts ruled the city's law to be unconstitutional, and threw it out.   Apparently, people in America have the right to eat and drink themselves to death.

0,"When I look at the left's response to the Trump campaign it reminds me of the Popular Front period in the 1930's. At that time, the various diverse elements of the American and European Left  put aside their doctrinal differences and joined forces to oppose the spread of fascism. It troubles me that Milbank doesn't see this.  The results then were ambivalent, of course--especially given the 1939 non-aggression pact between Stalin and Hitler--but  now  there exists  a similar imperative to unite in order to resist the rise of something that looks very much like fascism in the form of Trump.  The problem Chomsky identities is that the contemporary Democratic Party has moved so far to the right while the Greens have yet to build a viable national party. Stein's critique of Clinton's associations with the corporatist security state has considerable weight and accuracy, but the Greens have yet to build the national, regional and local organization that would give that critique relevance

I believe that everyone should be able to split income with their spouse (household income) but income sprinkling to my kids doesn't make sense. I do it because I would be an idiot not to, but it is just tax avoidance in relation to most other Canadians. If Drs need to be paid more, lets pay them more. As far as passive income, this is an idiotic move by our government. The loophole of being able to turn dividend income into capital gain income needs to be stopped as well, however without double taxing the succession of family farms, businesses and estates. The debate that has raged on over this on the G&M needs some balance. However in the end, our Liberal government needs to quit spending so much money and needs to not punish the creators in our economy to offset their run away spending habits.

The public does pay for this kind of spending in consumer goods prices, it's a part of their administrative overhead.   Money peddling is a successive investment to influence both individual legislators and their parties,   There is little favoritism by party, the money flows to power, so the party in the majority collects.  Too bad the public only watches this spending every 4 years, it happens every day, week, month somewhere in the US.

Eugene and Springfield both recently replaced street lighting with LED lighting and many of our trees still had their leaves in December.  In an interview in the RG with an arborist,  it was said that the extra weight of the leaves being on the trees with the freezing water was one reason the ice storm did so much damage to them.

Its then up to each individual community to decide how to spend that money.  This issue boils down to pupil transportation law, which I admit is something I know little about. But my basic understanding of law is that one designed to favor special groups or classes of the population would meet with judicial disapproval.

0,"In further comment where are you getting crafty?  I did not ignore any of your statements but merely pointed out that they are not all factual statements.   I also pointed out what Jesus Christ taught regarding the ideas of temptation and that he held the individual who chose to lust responsible for his sin of concentrating on sex instead of God during worship or any other time.  Jesus did not tell men to push women away to protect their chastity nor did he push women away from himself.  Mary Magdalene was called at the time, Christ's constant companion.  This is because she traveled with him and the 12 constantly.  You need to take on a gentler tone with people Trad.  There is nothing wrong with people supporting their debate with scripture, Gospel & OT.  If Exodus supported what you claim, then you could cut and paste the scripture stating that clearly.  You can't do this because it is not in the scripture.  It is not my job to prove your argument - that is your job & you haven't.

0,"The Conservative base is in the low thirties. By that I mean the present, Harper/post Harper base. The old Progressive Conservative base was larger, because the party was more moderate. Harper's takeover and shift rightward narrowed the voting base, but three terms of Chretien governments, Liberal infighting, Liberal arrogance and Liberal scandal forced moderate voters to give Harper a chance. Continued Liberal infighting, a succession of weak leaders and successful demonizing of them by Harper led to a majority government. After a single term of Harper majority, Canadians were so appalled that Conservative support plunged to its bedrock base level of low thirties as two out of three voters rejected them.  The Conservative Party is now paying the price for Harper's rightward shift. The activated base of far right supporters demand that their extreme views be adopted by leadership hopefuls, who must oblige to have a hope of victory, thereby alienating two out of three Canadians.

I do not wish to debate its laudable aims or whether there is another mechanism to better achieve this but it is particularly onerous when it involves high tech projects.  Let's face it, SA does not make trains.  You could subcontract some of the wheels or chassis elements but we don't do the expensive traction motors and control systems.  Even then, those bits that you subcontract will be more expensive.  Let's look at higher tech examples: what happens when SAA needs new planes or CSIR needs a new supercomputer?  Yes, SA does make some sophisticated antennas and composite cabin structures but these would constitute far less than 1% of the price tag.  On supercomputers – zilch.

Should historians from outside a specific culture not be allowed to research and publish? Wouldn't that lead to a stunted and biased body of historical works (acknowledging historical bias cuts both ways)? Or is the real issue here not about the stories of a culture, but the profits going to those outside the culture/community?

In the 80's when ASD schools were extremely overcrowded and we were all being taught in parking lot relocatables, we were learning more than kids today are and we were in much better condition to join the job market.  When you look at the money being spent now versus then, it points to problems within ASD that must be addressed.  The rest of the curriculum needs to be looked at for usefulness, as well as individual teachers - perhaps some classes should be cut that aren't critical to a human being able to get a job or pursue further education, and perhaps some teachers that just don't have the skills to actually teach our children should be removed.  Obviously, throwing more money at the ASD is like throwing money in a bonfire, so no matter what the NEA screams for we have all seen that more money does nothing but overpopulate ASD and fund unneeded expansions........

Unless you want to ensure easier access to guns for convicted felons or terrorists, there is absolutely no defense of the gun show loophole.  If a background check prevents a convicted felon with ill intent from purchasing a firearm and that felon isn't able to shoot up a liquor store, shopping mall or whatever that day, then how do you measure something that doesn't happen? Its like having to prove a negative.  Whether or not they would have prevented this mass shooting or that one, universal background checks are sensible.

Looking historically the Ontario PCs under Mike Harris made some small strides towards getting rid of corporate welfare, but it was a much smaller issue when he was Premier 15+ years ago.  Federally Stephen Harper was a mixed bag on this one, eliminating a lot of subsidies for oil and gas companies but increasing subsidies for manufacturing.

I didn't question the motive in the post by Allan Ross is simply asked why he cared about a dinner since it didn't affect him in any way. The reference to Merkel was simply an example to again wonder if the actions of every leader in the world are subject to his scrutiny , and if so why and if not why. It's a simple question as to why are people so emotional and ready to toss out insults over some dinner, that many people have never heard about . If Trump does something to our border we have reason to be concerned, but not going to a dinner....really ?

0,"In parts of the article the Klein writes as though he doesn't understand the very concept of insurance. For insurance to work effectively you need to have a larger, rather than smaller, pool of enrollees. Why? because a large pool of insured guarantees that you will have a mix of the old and sick along with the young and healthy. That's the only way insurance can work. Otherwise, only those who have an immediate need will enroll and the cost of paying for their medical bills will bankrupt the insurance company. In a healthy market, these people are indirectly subsidized by the young and healthy who pay premiums but have very low actual medical costs. And, don't forget that even the young and healthy can suffer medical catastrophes. Finally, when Klein writes """"if there were functional markets where healthier individuals could purchase cheaper insurance"""" he seems to misunderstand ObamaCare, which allows insurance companies to charge the older 3 times more than they charge the young.

0,"While in downtown Calgary at lunchtime, I was walking down a street when a car with 5 or 6 aboriginal men drove by.  They were making lewd comments at the female pedestrians, and said """"Hey Mr. Businessman.  Working hard to pay your taxes?""""  I made brief eye contact and smiled when determining where the noise was coming from, then returned my eyes looking forward.  When profane insults followed, I just ignored them and kept walking.  Then three of them go out of the car and assaulted me.  After they left, a passer-by who had witnessed the assault asked if I was okay.  When I returned to the office, I was taken to the hospital.  The police were called and I gave a description of the assailants.  They took out some pictures, which I recognized right away as the assailants.  They were known to police.  I was never contacted again; there was no day in court; no justice.  I have moved on since being victimized, but have not forgotten.  It is the only way forward...remember, but move on.

0,"No, they didn't take the electoral college into account. They didn't have sufficiently detailed state level polling to do that, and Trump crossed the threshold in states he won by less than margin-of-error anyway.  The EC projections were nothing more than a model - to address these known imprecisions, they take the data they do have (current polling and past election patterns) and run thousands of simulated elections, varying the parameters slightly with each mock run. The models predicted a Trump win about 10-20% of the time, an uncommon but not rare event.  He won all three of his threshold states (MI, PA, WI) by under 1% of the vote, well below the sensitivity of polling.  This is not inconsistent with it being something of a statistical fluke - you wouldn't need to change a lot of votes (about 85,000, circa 1/4000 of America's population) to change the total outcome. .

I would not try to prosecute Trump in an American court because American judges (and juries) will, in general, reflexively protect the power structure. However, based on the evidence so far, I think a fair trial would be very likely to end in a conviction.

A collective of bishops as a lobbying group does not benefit the church. - Governing for the good in the US is best influenced by men and women of good will behaving as informed citizens who talk to their elected representatives. - Thanks to the USCCB presidencies of Archbs Francis (Chicago) & Timothy (NYC) citizens know the hard limits of USCCB as a lobbying group and of the poor collective quality of its secular leadership of catholics. -  Lay catholics must expect each bishop to attend to the requirements of his episcopal offices, while upbuilding  God's kingdom in secular society.

0,"There is waste in K-12 and at the university, which is why the Senate is passing down massive cuts. The problem is that they are allowing the administrations (the waste) of those institutions to decide where cuts are made. The administrations of each of those institutions have decided to cut teachers, faculty, and programs that are critical to the functioning of those institutions and to providing an excellent education for our children, rather than cutting the waste (themselves)! The UA system, for example, has the largest statewide administration of any university of its size and spread in the U.S. by far. They """"cut"""" statewide by moving some positions to the MAUs rather than actually cutting those people, resulting in no net cut of waste. The FNSB school district throws millions at useless fads (e.g. personalized learning) so that they can act """"cutting edge"""", while cutting teachers and classes.

Traditionally, they spoke everything.  They wrote down nothing.  Thankfully, UAF linguists just finished formulating what previously unwritten Alaskan spoken languages ... would look like if they actually were in print.  Now state paid translators will be available to explain what the newly written versions of unwritten dialects look like and what they mean.   Knowledge is good.

You can refuse to accept those facts, but all one need do is look to Washington and Colorado to see that the black market in those states withered away after full legalization.  Going to the black market for cannabis in a state where any adult can stroll into a retail store to purchase much better product legally would be analogous to moonshining basically anywhere in the United States.

It makes absolutely no rational sense to set aside a gigantic marine sanctuary, the blow the hell out of a beautiful pristine tropical island ecosystem. Who is approving this stuff? Obama? What happened to him? How could an EIS ever get approved for this 60's era plan? Even strategically, it makes no sense. The potential adversaries in the Pacific, North Korea and China have northerly barren rocky beach heads, not soft, warm, sandy tropical beaches. It is no secret Obama never got the FBI, CIA, US Navy, US Army as supporters, and many of the top people have tried to sabotage him.

Minimum wage rules set a floor for jobs that require no specialized skills. These jobs will start to disappear if the minimum is set to high.

The notion that a higher minimum will """"float all boats"""" because of more money sloshing around is unproven.

This statement is a good example of using syntactic segregation so that the violence is condemned, and racism is condemned, but violent racism is not directly linked in the same sentence to the neo-Nazi supremacists.  I find it disingenuous that Trump can only address bigotry, even this obliquely, when some semi-literate and half-competent people write his press releases. When he speaks plainly in his mangled incoherent rambles, the style preferred by his fanatics, he condones right wing violence, enables supremacists, and is neo-Nazism's greatest apologist.

0,"It always seemed to me that St JP11's character was formed within communism; his focus was the evil of communism - he seemed to see everything through that lens. Sadly (like most of us) he could not shake the early imprint of his cultural surrounds (communism) in his attitude to other approaches (especially within the Church) and so he tended to be narrowly focussed and dictatorial. He never seemed to question/reflect upon Church tradition, dogma or praxis and the possibility that reform might be needed. In the wider world of politics he trusted western anti-communist advisors, and resisted anything that could be deemed communist. His war was against communism, for which one cannot blame him. It is a great sadness to me that he did not seem to understand the need for Vatican 2 and seemed to turn his back on its findings/conclusions as if they were irrelevant. It seems that he viewed the transformation of the Church as evil.

Taxpayers are fed up with repeated examples of excessive compensation within government.  If the standard pay was not sufficient for Mr. Sarkar, then another person with equal or better credentials could and should be hired (and yes, there are plenty out there).  The author fails to mention to lucrative cost-of-living and other assistance compensation that Mr. Sarkar will receive to be re-located in San Francisco.

While it is easy, and correct, to designate Trump as the Liar-in-Chief, I think he is better understood as the Bullsh*****-in-Chief."""" Several years ago, Harry G. Frankfurt published a book-length essay, """"On Bullsh*t"""", in which he distinguishes between a liar and a bullsh*****, A liar knows the truth and is deliberately trying to communicate a falsehood. A bullsh***** neither knows nor cares what the truth is; he says only what he thinks serves his purpose in the moment. Trump knows, believes and cares about very little, other than about Donald J. Trump; he just conjures up bull in the moment. Consider the nonsense he is sending his team of liars out to try to diffuse the despicable lie about Obama wiretapping him.

We get it.  The newspaper business is a very tough slog these days.  So you must be envious at how successful Trump has been at building a multi-billion dollar enterprise and becoming a multi-billionaire in the process.  It is easier to insult and demean and demonize The Donald than to consider the possibility that he might know what he is doing and be smarter than most of you arm chair quarterbacks.

I had one woman who was convinced that even though two road engineers looked at the roads in front of her house, that both, including the people back at the office who approve such plans, repaved the wrong road. How can trained people with 20-40 years experience make such a mistake? They don't. The best analogy is to think of a house that needs painting. The best way to save money on painting is to paint it before the paint cracks. Once it cracks and starts to fall off, the paint has to be removed before it can be painted. If you had homes that need painting or paint removal and limited money, would you repaint  7 homes before they went bad or the one that has to have the paint removed? That is roughly the relative cost of repaving vs rebuilding a street. The county does not have the money to do it all, so they make value based choices.

Mexico who has a government policy of using the army to raid and kill suspected drug cartels with some 150,000 people killed, and mass corruption with their justice system. The US still uses the death penalty and still has systemic high crime, racism and poverty.  The US also uses surveillance, conducts covert operations and destabilizes geo-political issues and backs authoritarian regimes such as Egypt.

It does not keep people honest, as workers can STILL show up when they want, leave when they want, and take just as much time at lunch as they took before. You don't need to clock out for lunch.  If a supervisor spends 20 to 30 hours per pay period now approving time, then could you admit that supervisor is not supervising the staff?  If each person ends up spending 1-3 hours per day coding their time card now and trying to ensure things are correct then that is 1-3 hours they are NOT doing their job they were hired for.  They had to hire more staff, to keep this running not less.  Why because the whole thing is so complex.  Almost 20% of the paychecks that were cut were under, then factor in all the paychecks that were over, and the sheer amount of time people have been paid to try and figure out """"what happened"""" so it doesn't happen again.

The assistant attorney general said the state was suing Purdue Pharma because the company broke Alaska's strong consumer protection laws. Well, if Purdue Pharma broke the law then convene a grand jury and arrest somebody. But the state’s lawsuit is about reimbursement of money, and that lawsuit will drag on for a long time, spending lots of money on attorneys and probably not change things much.

Im all for requiring people to have a photo ID to vote, but if you are going to implement such a program, they need to implement programs to assist those who do not have an ID (for any reason) into getting them the proper ID to vote. Requiring an ID to vote in this country is relatively new compared to how many years we went without requiring one.  So when Republicans implement these new rules, it dramatically affects those who are poor, or elderly...and no programs are ever created to help assist these people with being able to comply with the new rules.

Just try a Google search of the British model and you will see many complaints as well as other nations.  It is a fact of doing business.  Another perspective for you to consider, the yanks spend 3% GDP on their military (so in otherwords with a socialized model they could double their military spending and still save 3%GDP).  Canada spends 10% GDP on our Health System.  So we are better off fixing ours then emulating that mess down south despite some good experiences by people in getting service.

If military members and, according to Peter Micchiche those who work for Conoco Phillips, are reimbursed for only actual expenses while on temporary duty away from home, then why do Alaska legislators consider themselves entitled to much more in monthly per diem payments? Why do some legislators (like Josephson) use per diem money to purchase investment property in Juneau. Why do Liz Vasquez & Sam Kito use extra per diem income to makeup for lost income required by being legislators?  The math: $5,000(extra) x 60(members) = $150,000/month or $600,000/regular sessio

0,"I agree with you, Richard. I don't understand why it took a month for the call to be made to the police but that's not my issue. What I find interesting that so many people are bent on blaming the victim and not the thief. If reports are correct, Mackey knew those kennels weren't his but he took them anyway and that was just wrong. Yeah, Eischens could have called him but if Mackey denied stealing them, even in light of witness statements, what would Eischens be expected to do then? Drive to Mackey's house and confront him in his driveway? If that went sideways then Eischens gets hit with trespassing out of spite?  I don't know how the dog mushing business works but if Eischens has all his stuff insured and wanted to file a claim he would need a police report.

As a dual citizen (US/CANADA) born in NYC and growing up in NJ and Conn until going to university twice (undergrad & grad school) here in Canada, I can say without a doubt that this is EXACTLY what is happening in the US right now.  Quite frankly, I have NO IDEA where Kpare and Joe9999 heads currently are, except perhaps in the sand or eagerly looking at their favourite alt-right latest blog.  I've spent 20+ years in the investment industry, have headed institutional equity sales desks (along with FX and fixed income) and have made high six figure salaries, until the complete moral (and boarder-line illegal) daily practices of that industry made me leave in disgust.  Donald Trump is a liar, misogynist, sociopath, bigot, criminal and failed business man.  And while this current administration DOES frighten me somewhat, I know in the long run (in this case 4 years r less), Trump will reveal to the world the total fraud he truly is.

0,"The Hirst decision has less to do with water rights or fish and wildlife as it does the fact that the State Legislature passed a law that did not contain an implementation or a enforcement strategy..  The Growth Management Act, a law that was passed over the objection of the voters, contains a requirement for a determination that adequate potable water supplies exist prior to allowing future development.  The State has never enacted a way to render such a determination and that is where the Hirst decision comes into play.  The Supreme Court says that the law must be complied with.  Certain legislators see this as an opportunity to expand government controls and have expanded the discussion to include water rights and fish and wildlife.  There is NO SHORTAGE OF POTABLE WATER and that is not a part of the discussion.  Groundwater withdrawals result in no loss of water.  Water rights are governed by law.    It is time that the Legislature quit monkeying around  and come up with a plan.

0,"I'll explain.  Tourism supports tens of thousand of hotel workers.  Fire them  and that's tens of thousands of workers with no money.  So cancel what ever restaurants those workers  and tourist support, and the restaurants visited by other laid off restaurant workers.  Also cut or close most  grocery stores, clothing and shoe stores shopped by those above workers while not forgetting to add this last group to the unemployed.  Cars and houses will not be bought and most taxis will not be ridden. Thus add those employees to the mix.  Large numbers of rental housing will not be rented. Then the foreclosures begin of rental  and residential housing.  With this huge loss  of tax income to the State of Hawaiit and City, here by cutting services then cutting staff. Students will no longer have money to attend UH except where government funds are used. This will lead to layoffs in the system.  I don't think you can name a job, other than military, not affected by loss of tourism dollars.
"
0,"m: Unless you are going to create a whole new bureaucratic level of state government to write a unique tax code it is likely that our state income tax would be modeled and based on the amount of federal income tax an individual pays. In fact, that is what is proposed. Since only about 50% of all wage earners pay a federal income tax it is likely the same would apply to Alaska. Thus out of the 420,000 Alaskan wage earners only about 210,000 would pay the tax.

0,"Your figures on coho are not true.  The Elliott was a creation in change,  always,  from its inception until the late 1960s,  as land was exchanged, sold,  or bought.  It has been logged at the rate of about 30 million board feet a year until the NSP,  Murrelet and other litigation and the voluntary withdrawal by Gov Kitzhaber.  There is a great mix of stand ages because of logging,  and the careful direction and management of the Oregon Dept of Forestry.  Much of the """"school land"""" was sold or even homesteaded,  and the State got """"script"""" for acres owed but not in title due to unavailability.  Script was sold and """"Unclaimed Public Domain"""",  managed by the General Land Office,  could take the script as money,  which would now be considered a """"sale"""" of BLM land.  The Elliott was in play for trades and logging until the radical environmental lobby/litigants in the progressive liberal left government arena became involved in """"sue and settle"""" cases promoted by the Democrat Congress.

0,"That made me chuckle.  No, I'm not such a poor shot that I can't hit one pig with an open sight 30-30.  However, we're not talking about one pig.  While 30 rounds is overkill for one pig, 30 rounds feels right for a group of 30 (or more) pigs. They run in big groups. Feral hogs breed year round. Gestation period is 114 days, so a sow usually produces two litters each year.  She can birth anywhere from one piglet to a dozen, so they multiply like wildfire. Awhile back I read that there are an estimated 6 million wild hogs nationwide, and over half are in Texas alone.  So, when you're talking about ranches that are >= 10K acres, they can have big pig problems. We use dogs or helicopters and, believe me, 30 rounds is necessary.

For this reason efforts need to be made to silence such groups and deny them publicity.  But there were moderate right wingers there in Charlottesville wanting to be heard.  So it’s frustrating that only a small few in the MSM  are talking about the international well-funded group ANTIFA, which in recent times has taken to rioting  and using violence to silence even moderate conservative voices.  It was ANTIFA that sparked off 3 days of rioting at the Munich G20 after authorities ordered them to remove their face coverings if they wished to assemble.

As long as Hawaii can better hide its homeless & put more HPD cops in Waikiki to reduce the number of murders, stabbings & robberies in Waikiki, Hawaii tourism will do quite well.  SouthWest can make a big dent  from Hawaiian Air's monopoly & make some serious moolah in the process.  United might also take a little hit in their profits from their Hawaii travel routes.

The money did belong to Iran, true, but Iran would not release the hostages until the money was paid. That makes the money ransom. That is the take by almost all of the reporters and news organizations. If not ransom, then why not pay the money a week after the hostage release, or the following month? By paying the money on the same day as the hostage release and the hostages not being released until the cash had arrived makes it look like ransom was paid.

It is decidedly premature to ask a party who they are when they are currently engaged in a prolonged process to answer that very question.  At least the process is meaningful and interesting in that unlike the last Liberal leadership contest the party members will choose based on candidates' resume, competence and substance.

Several years later the girl returns to school - at the third grade reading level.  When I was a school nurse I was legally required to make reports of suspected abuse or neglect. Parents were never told who made the report, but they figured out (correctly most times) that it was the school. So they withdrew their children to avoid further scrutiny.  I believe home schooling is wonderful with competent parents. But there should be mandatory accountability. As a society we all benefit from an educated populace, but no one is verifying to see if home schooled kids are really being educated, or if they are safe (particularly when reports of suspected abuse have been filed). Tax money supports home schooling, so we the public should know if it is put to good use.

0,"Aisha's union would also have cemented Muhammad's longstanding friendship with her father, Abu Bakr. As was the tradition in Arabia (and still is in some parts of the world today), marriage typically served a social and political function – a way of uniting tribes, resolving feuds, caring for widows and orphans, and generally strengthening bonds in a highly unstable and changing political environment. Of the women Muhammad married, the majority were widows. To consider the marriages of the prophet outside of these calculations is profoundly ahistorical. What the records are clear on is that Muhammad and Aisha had a loving and egalitarian relationship, which set the standard for reciprocity, tenderness and respect enjoined by the Qur'an. Insights into their relationship, such as the fact they liked to drink out of the same cup or race one another, are indicative of a deep connection which belies any misrepresentation of their relationship.

He will try to distract the people by outrageous tweets and by the games he plays, but people are starting to stand up more then ever. We have much too lose. For example, how the world view the US. If we pull out of the Paris Accord we are telling the world that our treaty's to other countries means nothing to us anymore. Same thing goes with NATO and other countries we Militarily support. For example S Korea would be invaded by N Korea and that could destabilize the world economy. I think this time things will different then other President's because if Trump goes along with those around him, he will be making the following very angry - Blacks, Muslims, Native American, LGBT community, Public school teachers, women, immigrants, the elderly, the disable, middle class, poor and I sure I missed a few groups.

Trump violates the most essential social rules of human relationships--lying, bullying, insulting, confusing...assuming that only he knows best.

First would be the return to Canada, and the public eye, of Omar Khadr's odious mother and sister. Having left for parts unknown (wink, wink) a fraction of $10.5 million would buy a very nice home for the jihadist duo, anywhere in Canada.  Second would be a serious terrorist event in Canada, with mass public casualties.

If they are women and children, then it's likely they will be on some form of government assistance until the children are old enough to work. The cultural shock will take many years to overcome, and language training, already in short supply, will definitely be needed. Then there will be the PTSD that no doubt many of these refugees will be suffering. Again, help for this is in short supply. All too often after the photo-ops are over and the media have lost interest these people are left to wander around in a world unfamiliar to them, often unable to communicate, and floundering, but in better living conditions. If we are going to do this, and no doubt Trudeau will, then set a goal and design a programme and a plan for the number you plan to bring in. Make sure all the assistance , language trainers, and every other assistance needed is in place , before one person lands in this country.

In the event that fails and it does go to all out war, the preparations should be ready along with a coalition.  However, they are going to need Russia's help, or at the minimum non-involvement.  The goal of the intervention should be Korean reunification and the elimination of the current system of governance in North Korea.

A bathroom & shower, with a room, that they can live in, with all the government & private services under the same roof, 24/7/365, might be a cheaper alternative, to remove the visible homeless.

0,"Sadly, without exception , the focus is still revolving around the extraction of oil, and how best to prop up a declining industry. Not one of them is looking outside the parameters established by the """" Oil Cartel """". Only when we make the determination that this industry is NEVER going to show the record profits again that the oil companies have acquired from the state's oil. Pouring money down the drain in the form of """" Credits """" is the single most blatant cause for urgency. The Courage needed to make the right decisions for our state is being squashed by a Gerrymandered Republican Legislature that succeeded in a """" Hostile Takeover """" of our state Government. This is an orchestrated attempt for the very same fools that squandered a 13 billion dollar surplus ,a AAA credit rating, and got nothing in return to benefit the states residents. Now they want to play with the PFD. These people do NOT represent Alaskan Residents , they represent the Oil Industry to Alaskans.

Furthermore, we have refuge after refuge that came to our shores, worked their butts off, and went into business. remember the LA riots when the blacks terrorized the Korean businesses? It's one excuse after another. Rather than point the finger at dysfunctional republicans ask yourself this question; why is it after black sports players have spent billions of dollars on charity programs they started has the problem of poverty remained the same over the decades?

However, Sandra Martin fails to mention the extremely poor level of health care that we provide to many of our citizens outside of jails in this country. Possibly she assumes that everybody has an extended health plan or the money and contacts to get decent services for their families. Those who pay (either directly as in BC for public health care, or through various taxes elsewhere in the country) face a shortage of doctors and lengthy waiting lists even for urgent treatments. They pay for their prescriptions and of course dental care is not included. It's a struggle for a lot of honest people and their families. Frankly I have far more sympathy for the working poor and for our disabled citizens and I would prefer that any additional funding goes towards meeting their needs as opposed to those of our prisoners.

0,"One should be skeptical when a writer uses exaggerated statements such as """"everyone"""" in the subscription area and """"total"""" panic over Trump’s order. Freiberg says these are the """"impressions"""" one gets. Some may get these impressions, but they are interpretations. To address Freiberg's claims, I compiled information from sources. 1. The vetting procedures applied to Iraqi citizens and only to refugees. The Trump executive order, applies to 7 countries. 2. Contrary to Trump’s statement, Obama did not “ban visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.” Refugees don’t travel on visas. Refugees continued to be admitted to the United States during that time. 3. Obama's process was orderly, conducted over roughly a dozen deputies and principals committee meetings, involving cabinet and deputy cabinet-level officials from all of the relevant departments and agencies.  One can argue other points, but these are the points that contradict Freiberg's assertions. But will they change """"impressions""""?

It'll be hard to top the con that claimed that if we only lowered their taxes and showered them with tax credits and write-offs, the oil companies would increase production to a million barrels a day, there'd  be jobs, jobs and more jobs, economic nirvana would rain down on Alaska and petroleum club membership would soar.  SB21 set the bar high but I'm sure someone at the club is up to the task.  BTW, you can't use the Trump con. It has already been claimed and trademarked and the majority of Alaska voters have already fallen for it...so the Trump con is ineligible for the BS21 contest.

And, it's a tad harder to commit suicide by train; while knives and ropes are more labor-intensive and take more than an instantaneous act of will - both give the distraught just a tad more time to reflect and perhaps reconsider.

The Globe has very recently run articles explaining why it is virtually impossible to get organised crime out of the marijuana business. . The private market is simply not going to achieve that objective.  On the contrary, it presents an entire new range of opportunity for organised crime to dominate the business through the traditional means of violence and intimidation. . You may not like the LCBO, but a regulated government agency, backed up by the police, has a lot better chance of succeeding than private businesses. . So that 25 years from now the marijuana business is as free from crime as the selling of alcohol.

0,"Though Jews discriminate no less than others, discrimination alone isn't apartheid. Apartheid occurs when a minority group in a territory, backed by the full might of the government they control, suppresses and abuses a democratic majority in that same territory. And that's the situation in Palestine. Israel calls the shots there, not the democratic Palestinian majority.  Again, the parallels to apartheid South Africa are clear. The SA government would intervene in the black territories if, say, a white settler or corporation wanted land and resources there. The territory's so-called autonomy would disappear, and if necessary the military would be sent in to enforce the will of Johannesburg.  I began the discussion by saying that there are significant human rights abuses throughout the Middle East. But there's only one apartheid state in the region: Israel.  Wishing you a good day, too.

0,"There is no conflict of interest if any legislation has broad application. Please see the last paragraph on page 2 of the Ethics Commissioner's letter to Mr. Morneau.  She notes that there is no """"personal interest"""" if some benefit accrues to a class of persons. Anything that benefits Morneau Shepell is going to similarly benefit a large group of the company's competitors. In the case of Individual Private Pensions, that would be major banks, Desjardins, Power Financial, various insurance companies. So, for example, no MP could vote on legislation that benefits children if he or she has children or grandchildren - wrong! - the beneficiaries are a class (parents), not the MPs who happen to be parents.

Just to add to the list... so did Hitler (albeit with Nazi thugs disrupting other parties' meetings, beating up their supporters etc). And as the saying goes, the rest is history.  A major flaw in our constitution is that it was drafted with rose-tinted spectacles firmly in place and when dealing with the president and his or her powers etc, appears to have drafted with a saint in mind.  Instead, they should have been drafted with the worst of sinners in mind, so that presidential powers could be curbed where necessary, bad decisions over-ridden and blocked where necessary and the president removed if found to be totally unfit as president - as Zuma is.  But they were not and again, as the saying goes... the rest is history. But the tragedy is that we are all living it -  and our children will still be paying for it for decades.

0,"I do not think Bautista wanted to play for any team other than the Blue Jays.  It is a matter of money and Bautista unfortunately had an injury plagued year that hindered his ability to effectively renegotiate.  I look at it from a strengths based perspective of having a fine year in spite of the injuries who never had a chance to recover that plagued him to the final out of the season.  In spite of this, he toughed it out.  He is a player who who typically has stellar health and an exceptional history of success.  There is no reason he should not repeat this success.  He has at least 3 more years of professional play left.  He would greatly add to his game if he became more involved in base stealing- being the Fowler the Jays failed to land.  Bautista will make fools of his detractors.

0,"Some of what you say is true. However, there are tons of union civil servants currently masquerading as teachers in classrooms. The craft is rife with cr@ppy people. People who truly are not called to the honorable profession of educating our youth, but are rather lower-echelon people whose lofty ambition and high point in life is the attainment of a State job. Teaching just happens to be it. They would have loved working in the admin offices of Forestry or the newly formed Climate Change office of the City if teaching didn't open up for them. Until the union can behave like a true trade guild and implement internal policing and raising its own members into the heights of its craft, I will not empathize with teachers at all. Sorry about that for the few good ones out there...

However it seems that our representatives should be focused on how to use the current state income to cover existing programs, not new ways to give more away.  If compromises can be found to cover costs of potentially new spending like this, why can't those same compromises be used to fund existing programs without new taxes?

"
0,"Perhaps, I'm stating the obvious, but it seems from these posts that I need to point out the obvious to those without DB or DC plans complaining here...  You have to pay in, and this makes life hard when money matters most (ie., while raising a family).   Where I work, the underfunded DB pension plan is more than 30% of the employer's cost, with both the employer and the employee paying more than 15% of gross income (which reduces take home pay by at least 25%).  Between the taxes, various deductions and the PP, your paycheque can be surprisingly small.  A word of advice.   If you have a plan and you go to buy a house, the bank is going to tell you you can afford WAY MORE house than you can actually afford.  Incredibly, they look at your gross income more closely than your actual take home pay.  Personally, I'd rather have 32% more pay, but that's not an option.

A man who has no experience at all in civic matters after living for six decades, and never done anything previously to serve our community,  suddenly now wants to be our Mayor?    That is such a joke.  The fact that his campaign is focusing so much on Springfield's schools shows how totally ignorant he is about how government works.   The City government plays no role at all with the schools in Springfield.   They are operated by the Springfield School District, which is entirely independent of the city government.   The School District gets its funding from local property taxes and from the state government in Salem, neither of which the city of Springfield has any control over whatsoever.   And yet, he criticizes Mayor Lundberg for the low graduation rate of Springfield's high schools.  What a ridiculous campaign.

Historically, one small step after another toward making progress suggested  by American officials ( in this case Tillerson), no matter how noble, gives Putin the freedom to interpret it however he wants depending what his hidden agenda is.  He can, for example, appear agreeable and even admire the potential solutions with respect to any problems in the world, and yet show  antithetic conduct that  would serves his calculated outcomes. This is not to say that Tillerson and others should not come up with constructive suggestions, be it in Syria, Iraq, Iran or any other trouble spots, but it does say to be vigilant and be ahead of the political chess game.

This is why the question at long last ended up in the hands of then-Msgr Lopes at the CDF.  There is more union between faithful Catholics and faithful Anglicans, even those who haven't come into the Ordinariate than there is between secularized nominal Catholics and faithful Catholics or between faithful Anglicans and post-Christian modernist Anglicans.  And this is felt on both sides.  Give it time.  The post-Christian Anglicans have no faith to pass on and those in the middle have refused to pass on their lukewarm faith.  Soon the only impediment will be the reluctance of more Protestantized """"evangelical"""" Anglicans to be in union with Rome.  (Old prejudices die hard!)

Judges are human beings too, after all, and asking someone to turn down something like that, just because Congress was engaging in their usual political gamesmanship, feels like asking too much.  The real, pertinent issue is whether or not Gorsuch will be a truly competent and impartial judge. In other words, a good judge. I haven't seen anything that indicates he wouldn't.  I think the circumstances that led to his nomination were despicable, but that's a battle already lost. Somebody was going to be nominated, and it wasn't going to be Garland. So it's more useful, I think, to focus on making sure that the the best possible person is nominated rather than continuing to fight over a lost battle.

Read it carefully and more than once to see the massive lying operation orchestrated by the Republican party led by Governors and legislators in the pockets of the Koch billionaires and Karl Rove.  All designed to rig the local and state elections by ridding the electorate of any and all minorities and suspected anti-Republicans.  Systems of computer algorithms purging voter rolls joined with rigged ballot counting computers bought and paid for by elected Republicans in control of elections processes.  Started in the 1990s and finalized in the 2016 election.  The reason all polls-exit and national- told the opposite story from the rigged system.

However, if Mr. Stewart feels an adopted initiative being found unconstitutional and being, thereby, voided """"creates more divisions and mistrust"""", he needs to imagine the level of division and distrust the adoption of this clearly unconstitutional measure will create.  Commissioner Jay Bozievich said the idea is “not about trying to block citizens’ right to the initiative process.”   Actually, Commissioner, read it,... that is exactly what the idea is about.

The sales taxes on the mainland are much more than Hawaii but they invest much more in their educational infrastructure. If we think students can cover the cost of our higher education by raising tuitions, our colleges won't be competitive with mainland institutions.  As a whole, UH dorms are a embrassment. Frear Hall is the newest and should be the standard for all the dorms. I couldn't ask my child to stay in a dorm without hot water or furniture that was used when I was there 30 years ago.

0,"""""Entry-level economics teaches us, however, that there is no relationship between cost and price.""""  I stopped reading at this point.  Complete nonsense.  Rubbish.  A company is entirely constrained by the cost of its product.  Imagine the company pays $3 for their widget (after all discounts and rebates are accounted for) and tries to make a profit by reselling it at $2.50.  If anyone thinks they can make a profit this way, don't go into business.  Companies survive by selling their product a prices higher than their net cost.  The difference must also pay for overhead, salaries, insurance, etc. etc.  So if the profit margin is a couple of percent before measure 97, the company must raise prices or go out of business (assuming it can't fire people to reduce cost).  I suspect that Mr. McKinney's company is not subject to the tax so of course he wants his competition to face it.

We were “chosen in Christ before the world was made,” as the hymn in Ephesians puts it (1:4). Our sin could not possibly be the motive for the divine incarnation, but only perfect love and divine self-revelation! For Scotus, God never merely reacts, but always supremely and freely acts, and always acts totally out of love. Scotus was very Trinitarian.""""

The photo with the statue on the Episcopal church gives us a hint of the past glory of this riverside community which was once the major port in the region; a town  once known as the """"White City""""  for all the lovely white houses on the hill as the mill owners gave free white paint to their owners.  Travelers on their way  south would do well to stop and look around, including in  the historic  hillside cemetery with its grand view of the river. But no matter the beauty, a town needs an economy and Gardiner is almost a ghost town today.  The mills are gone and it's no longer used as a port.

So real information about the ground motions characteristics is not exactly known in this part of the Anchorage Bowl.

Whether to build  or not to build in this area, I will not argue on that, as it is policy of the city, I can only say based on scientific study that this area will show high ground amplification even at 5 Hz which is roughly the natural frequency of two storied building. So there will be a risk but how to offset that risk is surely a challenge for engineers.

And two, he filed a lawsuit against the Clintons and several other parties. In the video, Paul implies that the lawsuit came first and that the Clintons pulled the strings of government to shut him up because of it  Paul actually filed suit on June 19, 2001, according to legal documents, days after his June 8 indictment, and well after he knew of the investigation that led to it.

Perhaps, only those countries that do ten ha of reforestation for each ha of deforestation should be allowed to sell lumber. Consideration could be given to adding on a carbon tax to Canadian lumber exported to other countries.  Canada has 9% of the world's forest area per the UN, 348 million ha.

Canada having the largest coastline area and second largest forest area has a massive CO2 sponge ...the plant life therein consumes 2,000 million tonnes of CO2 annualy.

And yet Obama thought it was fine that China could receive funding under the Paris Climate Accord and could increase CO2 until 2030.  Makes you wonder!!!!!!!

Again Jesus' actions toward the Samaritan woman were a promise of change in the traditions of the time. This includes ethnic groups and race as well. He came with a new approach in relating to each other that would have played out if the church had remained faithful to Him. Instead it became the RCC which was the ultimate in dividing people and promoting hierarchy. This also promoted the  inequality of slaveholding that caused the cultural destruction of the New World with its history of bringing unwilling slaves to America. The principle is echoed in the Bible as there being no difference in Jew or Greek... in His Kingdom. We know in our heart this is true but tradition blocks it out just as the Sunday-keeper blocks out the meaning of Jesus' rest in the Sabbath.

Not only have the Turks historically been supressing the Kurds and Christians but they were also responsible for the mass genocide of the Armenians who were largely Christian.

I have some simulations of how the US election would have turned out under PR and preferential voting at http://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2016/11/23/voting-reform-to-stop-a-canadian-trump/#.WD7S8fkrKUk

I'm saying that human contributions to global warming are settled science: we know based on more than 14,000 studies conducted since the early 1990s through the 20-teens that we are a component of the warming we're experiencing.  I agree we don't know exactly how big a role we played (though consensus indicates we are significant contributors) or how bad it will get, and thats really the scarier part. We're sitting at the edge of a completely unknown severity, planet-wide phenomenon that can and likely will have a profound effect on our economies, civilizations and even our ability as species to survive on this rock. Yet we will bicker and squabble about whether it's happening, and whether we should do anything to stop it, rather than take action.

0,"Of course the author is right.  But this absurd state of affairs is steam rolling ahead and anyone who dares offer a contrarian word is immediately shouted down.  As someone noted earlier, the native segment of the population is only 4 percent, but you can't open a paper or turn on the radio without this agenda being promoted without question.  I know the cbc is much maligned around these parts, but I used to really enjoy several of their radio programs.  Now it's practically unbearable.    Some of the guests are promoting undemocratic seditious ideas, suggesting for example that the 4 percent should hold government decision making power over everyone else.  The radio hosts don't even bat an eye.  They just nod and agree.

0,"""""We have a Muslim community that rejects the hateful ideology of terrorist jihad..."""".  Intriguing declaration!  In the past, when abortion clinics got bombed in Canada, I don't recall writers rushing to exclaim: """"We have a Christian community that rejects the violent ideology of anti-abortion extremism"""". Indeed, some pundits seemed to like the idea of smearing Christians in general with a broad brush, seeing them as impediments to progressive legislations.  And when Quebec separatists violently kidnapped politicians, I don't recall writers rushing to exclaim: """"We have a separatist community that rejects the violent tactics of these outlier traitor extremists who kidnap innocents"""". Indeed, some pundits seemed to like the idea of smearing all separatists with a broad brush, seeing that as a useful tactical narrative.  In reality, Christians, Quebec separatists and Muslims are each diverse groups. Curious how DIFFERENT the reasons are, for each group, for NOT recognizing that in print!

0,"Jim, we agree that was a pretty disgusting reaction from Dunthorpe, but he's been a  very open outspoken anti-Semite here. Regarding  Eli Wiesel, he was a remarkable man, outlasted the concentration camps with his mind and morals intact, wrote and taught about peaceful relations, and certainly deserved  his Nobel Prize.  He's spoken out powerfully on any number of world conflicts on behalf of the victims. I like the quotes Karen Meyers used here. However, there is one side of Wiesel which has bothered many people for years--his refusal to directly speak out about the suffering of the Palestinians at the hands of the expanding state of Israel.  Jim, if you google """"Wiesel and the Palestinians"""" you'll find lots of examples. What makes this especially upsetting to many people has been precisely his famous quote """"Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. """"

Unit 20 C has 4 times less moose and bears than 20 b.   Ask about the Denali caribou herd. Ask why the Alaska range caribou herd went from 14,ooo to 25oo in 2 years under gov. Knowles.  Read the old timers account of the game in the country. All of the interior was in a predator pit. A moose, any moose, was hard to come by. Unit 20 C is one of the last predator strong holds. Thanks to guides and bear baiters, this is going to change. And in the long run there will be more of everything.  One thing has been proven beyond doubt. Predator control works. Moose and caribou love it. Dall sheep love it. Wolves love it in the long run. Denali Park is in a predator pit. Everybody with a brain knows it. And the huge area that is game/ prey deficient is not some thing they can blame on hunters.Take your pick

The school was forced to abandon the rules, and thus the kids abandoned the lawsuit.  He was right to. The right of schools to make rules does not supercede the constitutional rights of students. As was recently confirmed in the OGOD case yet again.  You spoke of limits to rights. Do you understand that the rights of school boards to make rules are ALSO limited rights ? They can't make rules that discriminate, intrude on freedom of religion, or needlessly on freedom of expression. Hair rules do all three.

Normally I would agree with you that science cannot determine morality. In his particular instance, the charge is that homosexuality is intrinsically disordered. Science certainly can influence how we think of the order in the universe. From there, disorder could be understood differently, influencing moral judgments. If some people are born as homosexuals, ie have no choice in the matter, it cannot be immoral and it is harder to say it is a disorder.  I dont really think science has reached that point, but it has established the idea that sexuality is innate. I don't think we should stop people from considering the implications.

Not everyone can get enough scholarships to fund their college. The AK performance scholarship is an investment in Alaska - if you believe that our greatest resource is our young people. For the state legislature to cut this very important resource as one of its first knee-jerk reactions to cutting the budget, while at the same time refusing to cut tax credits for the oil companies, shows their commitment to this resource. It may be that this scholarship opportunity will have to end someday, but I think that the kids who are already in the program should be grandfathered.

0,"Thanks for writing this truthful recognition of Obama's uniqueness and strength. People don't get passionate and energized when someone slows down and thoughtfully acknowledges the """"weakness and legitimacy"""" of both sides of a conflict--which is what Obama has been asking us to do for a long time. But I can think of nothing better than to step back and take Obama's view. We can become passionate about learning to think and feel from all sides, to suspend up our certainties.  I wish our schools and universities would teach the intellectual virtues Obama displays, but they seem too wrapped up in their foregone conclusions and the inculcation of correct beliefs and attitudes to step back and take on this task. It's too bad because inculcating beliefs and forcing students to parrot language will not bring about the long-term and deeper change that cultivating intellectual virtues would.

Knowing this, why do you hold only the woman as accountable?  Why are you not preaching to men and their sons, that they should never brag about their sexual conquest, or live in fear of shame about being a virgin still at 18?  Yea right, you can stop a President from 'locker room' talk, just as easily.   It's not going to happen with the majority of men.  Accept the responsibility of men in the case of pregnant woman and demand that he take care of the child, full time, pay for the medical cost, take on sleepless night, and explain to his wife just why they have another child in their home, (If the woman agrees to carry the fetus to full term).

Naturopathic 'medicines' and supplements have ingredients and one of the issues is whether they do in fact contain the herbs and other ingredients they claim to contain. Better regulation by Health Canada of these products will protect the consumer.  I expect some naturopathic products do work, but I suspect others don't do what is claimed. And if some herbal products do actually work, that is worth knowing. Interestingly some naturopathic products are already backed by good scientific trials. Many are not.  Most egregious of all are homeopathic 'medicines'... which by their own admission contain pure water. Rather than go through Health Canada, these might as well label themselves as magic, and seek endorsement from Harry Potter.

Today, the BA is the new high school (or depending on program, community college). Even then, earnings are relatively static. Entry level positions pay less and are more likely to be precarious than in the past.  = a winner-take-all society which requires parents to invest ever increasing resources and vote for pulling up the ladder to ensure opportunity for their child.

These are the right things for a manager at his level to be doing. I know you don't know me from adam, but the questions he's asking and the observations he's making are fair.

Civics class is meant to teach students such things as The Constitution, scientific election and polling processes, government processes, etc. if the mock election were run properly as an educational tool, the students would have been told several facts including that the results would not be published due to its non-scientific methods. The demographics are not representative of the specified populatio, nor is the group conducting the poll an approved neutral entity. You are correct in that it referenced the results and not the process which would be mandated by the scientific process.

Some places still are under lots of ice. Show me some projections. Last I heard from inconvenient truth and its models are that the coastlines should be well inland by now.

No, again you are wrong the net effect is not zero.  Example: a federal bond is purchased for $100, the bond purchaser provides $100 to the treasury and receives an interest bearing bond. That $100 received by the treasury is spent on government operations and 67% of spending is entitlement programs. When the bond is redeemed the treasury must provide $100 plus a dollar amount for the interest. We will say $1 to make it easy for you. The treasury either pays the bond from the general fund (income taxes) or borrows $101 dollars to redeem the bond and pay the interest.  This is why interest on the debt was $222 billion in 2015 with interest rates at historically low levels.  """"...drops to about 28%"""" With this statement you have admitted that entitlement programs receive the largest percent on federal spending.

Romans 13 makes it clear that Christians (and popes) are to respect civil governments. Coming into a country ILLEGALLY clearly resists civil authority. Pope Francis proclaiming that DACA is pro-life, reveals his rebellion to God. (Isaiah 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil).  Should nations have borders and immigration laws? The Law of Moses laid out borders for Israel. Furthermore, the Law also instructed Israel on how to handle aliens/foreigners. They had to eventually become Jews or get expelled. After Nehemiah led the people to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem, he expelled the foreigners from the city and punished the Jews for raising their children to be pagans (Nehemiah 13).

The first principle constraining our conscious evolution of doctrine under the guidance of the Holy Spirit is that science and doctrine can never be in ultimate conflict since the ultimate author of both is One. All appearances of conflict must be misunderstandings, and such apparent conflicts are pressing invitations to allow the Holy Spirit to take us deeper, to continue the evolution with honest revision.

The old Friar teaching us laughed and said the original Latin was much more graphic.  And this was in one of the official lives of St Francis from the Middle Ages.

Congress must find a permanent resolution that conforms to the Constitution and dispose of the remainder of the public lands it now holds. Article One Section Eight, set up our Nation Capitol. More importantly it kept the balance of power. This area will never become a State, it will never have Senators. Adding two senators to 26 current would have upset the power of balance.

When people drink the Kool-Aid, they become convinced of ideas which have no basis -- like Hillary Clinton belonging in prison.  It is the Kool-Aid that people who deny global warming drink.  And after drinking, they are left with the view that politicians, not scientists, can judge best this question. Whether you agree with his politics or question his effectiveness in solving world problems, President Obama (and his family) have represented this country with dignity.  I am proud of his service to America.  Beause he is a man of morality, he deserves respect and our nation's gratitude.  Mr. Jackson, put down the Kool-Aid.

0,"Utter nonsense. Nagasaki and Hiroshima were targeted specifically because they were heavily populated civilian areas. The whole idea was to shock the Japanese imperial command into surrendering by demonstrating the horror of the bomb. It was a cold, calculated and deliberate attack on a civilian population.  The A-bomb wasn't produced to destroy factories, and nobody in their right mind believes that was the intent at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. And even if it were, the fully predictable and inevitable collateral damage would still have made dropping the bombs morally unjustifiable by any reasonable standard, and certainly by the standard of Catholic moral teaching.  I don't judge Truman or the U.S. military. I'm sure they did what they thought was right. But what they did is still objectively horrific, and nobody who rationalizes it has any ground to stand on in criticizing the brutality of others.

0,"Yes, I'm sure there are detailed instructions regarding the regalia worn by various hierarchs.  Pope Paul simplified some of the cardinals' accouterments -- for instance, the galero (the round hat that used to be hung from a cardinal's cathedral after he died) was suppressed.  The cappa was not suppressed, but it was shortened, and if I remember correctly, its use was limited to certain days or feasts.  I found a reference to a 1969 document titled """"Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates"""" but I couldn't find the document itself. I do think that Pope Francis would do the church a service if he simplified the non- or extra-liturgical garb of cardinals and bishops -- I think he already did for the 'lesser prelates' (love that expression) -- and codified the simplification as Pope Paul did in 1969.

This was introduced by a PC Government and was designed to encourage savings and avoid taxes on income. Characterizing the GST as a 'tax on human activity' is a valid characterization but distracts from understanding the justification behind it. The carbon tax is not a tax on 'all human activity' as it just applies to carbon usage.  Germany has adopted a program which relies on green energy. Green energy is becoming a bigger part of the German economy. Is the German economy bankrupt or is your hypothesis inconsistent with reality?

The appointment of a pontifical delegate effectively neutralizes Burke, but it's only a band-aid. At some point, obviously, Burke has to be replaced so that the Knights can resume normal relations with the Holy See. I imagine that's being negotiated already.

Americans are experiencing skyrocketing health insurance costs—premiums, co-pays, and deductibles—which is the opposite of what the law’s name promised: affordable. The ACA is wasting trillions of dollars even though President Obama initiated his takeover of health care claiming we had to “bend down the [health care] spending curve.” The original 1965 Medicaid law created a “jointly funded, state administered” program.

The only military option is for the U.S. to attack NK alone. Because SK and Japan will not join, and SK will not initiate war. If U.S. does attack it will 1) cause a devastation and bloodshed greater than Vietnam War for NK, SK, Japan and the U.S. itself'; 2) will lose military alliance with SK and Japan; 3) will trigger a military response from China and Russia (this is confirmed officially by them). It will trigger WW3. And thus all U.S. assets around the world will be subject to  attack.  Faced with this, Trump talks, yell and threaten. This is all he can do.

I don't agree with MSW on the MediCare deal...Think that a very sneaky Rep strategy is planned that mixes Medicaid, ACA and Medicare into a fast track bill in Congress scheduled almost immediately after the inauguration, that masks the horrors and woos folks with special favors ....with a long term due date after the midterms...I would put absolutely nothing past Ryan et al..AND Ryan has looked terribly happy lately which I interpret as he thinks he can bust these budget breaking programs for good....(forget the poor, the sick/poor elderly,  the uninsured and after those tax cuts there wont be money for them anyway)  I would pay very very special attention to that early legislation.

0,"The Canon deals with ALL the faithful, including religious, deacons, priests, and bishops.  In the instant case, the cardinals did not """"impose"""" a view. They asked questions about something that was doctrinal, not “pastoral”.  And the Holy Father did not take it well, did not seek dialogue, did not even acknowledge questions had been asked.  At that point the cardinals, consistent with Canon 212, went public.  I continue to scratch my head wondering why some folks keep slavering over his approach.  My working hypothesis is that it falls under """"the enemy of my enemy is my friend"""" rubric.

The single family dwelling is the economic, social and environmental scourge of urban areas and suburbia. Especially over the last 25 years, 905 municipalities and the OMB have allowed developers to squander green space by developing massive subdivisions of single family dwellings. Such developments should have been banned long ago. The lowest allowable density should be a row house. The most common unit,  the low rise condo. Nothing short of taxing single family dwellings out of existence, and banning their construction will alleviate the housing shortage.

0,"Poor phrasing on my part, maybe """"entail"""" would have been a better word.  It is my understanding that in Jesus' time only men could obtain divorces, and that they could do so by simple proclamation.  The divorced former wife was left with no rights at all.  Furthermore, I believe the man also divorced -- they used the same system -- a woman to whom he was engaged.  Engagement was, I think, the signing of the marriage contract with ceremony to follow.  Hence, Gabriel had to intervene to persuade Joseph to not divorce Mary.  In short, I would presume Jesus was speaking of divorce to men as practiced by men in His society.  It is my belief that we can not say for sure what he would say about divorce in the Western world today.  I do know that, in Ireland, where divorce is a relatively recent development, prior to its legalization, men simply deserted wives.  Finally, marriages for life are marriages for a lot more decades than 2000 years ago, and humans, we now know, continue to develop.

0,"Rationalthought: The problem with """"yes"""" or """"no"""" style polling questions is that they generate responses that are often bluntly interpreted as indicating wholehearted approval or rejection. So, to be accurately interpreted, such polling results should be examined in view of other available data to generate more fulsome analysis. You might recall a poll that was done in 2014 that revealed a high level of general support for the then-current immigration policy while more detailed questioning revealed that a lot of respondents vastly underestimated the actual immigration intake level. When respondents were informed about the actual level, support for immigration policy diminished substantially and only 15 percent wanted immigration intake levels to rise beyond 250,000. In other words, polling results are often reported on the basis of responses to absolute propositions, where the results tend to be interpreted as accurately (or wholeheartedly) reflecting public opinion.

Obama, was a great communicator, but on many issues delayed confrontation with Russia (Syria etc..)  Hate Trump if you want, but Obama officials stated publicly that he knew during the campaign and did not deal with it.  The people who said this are Obama supporters.

We might finally see another Ross Perot — and this time, there is enough critical mass to elect one. Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura comes to mind — for starters.

0,"This assumes the 'renter' is disciplined enough to invest the cash properly earning at least 6-7% per annum rate of return.  On the flip side, a home owner with 10% down on a $500,000 ppty for example only has $50,000 of capital in the game and leverage working for their 3% inflation type returns thus the actual return on investment before interest costs are ~30% / per annum, lower after interest costs but still better ROI vs. the renter (assuming they're not using leveraged money).  The security of owning one's home is another factor (non-financial of course) which likely add to one's happiness and ability in making smart financial decisions over the course of their life.  No doubt though that currrent home prices in the likes of Van & TO are elevated. As a result, anyone without a 5-10 year time horizon should consider renter as there is little margin of safety in Cdn house prices (most markets) as rates are even lower than they were in the 1930s thus elevating valuations.

Mike Harris spit in the face of the GTA population by creating this very limited representation at the municipal level and giving the local  bodies very limited authority.  The real problem though  is even more fundamental: it is that two of Canada's provinces are too large to be democratically governed. Ontario, specifically, ought to be split into at least three separate provinces: the GTA, Southern Ontario (excluding GTA) and Northern Ontario. Not only would this give citizen a more manageable  set of politicians to choose and control, it would also much improve the dynamics at the federal level.

I can't help wondering if using words differently is not just another attempt to sound more knowledgeable when there is such a descriptive vocabulary already available. Frankly I find the UK's slang use of the word 'bonking' the most fitting.

But remember; 3 million barrels of Canada Oil goes to the US every day; which is discounted by 40 even 50% so why do we have to pay so much? Well as one poster noticed it is greedy simple minded politicians for sure but it is also greedy oily, greasy and gassy.

In my opinion, the key to finding a real woman in charge is if she's listed as the senior pastor. In Pentecostal churches, that's almost always where the power resides.  You might be interested in this article, Nora. It discusses just this issue - I found it enlightening;  https://www.faithandleadership.com/qa/james-bowers-and-kimberly-alexander-leadership-and-women-pentecostal-ministry  regards ... Dave

Trump isn’t learning. His campaign isn’t getting any better.  Just look at his target audience for this and all his speeches, his audiences is full of people who are not very bright.

0,"I think the distrust is a real issue, on many levels. There is also very little understanding that family is about relationships not biology. It is a very unloving parent who disowns a child because they are different or choose to live a different way of life. Our children (and grandchildren) know our values; the fact that one is divorced and lives with his partner does not mean that we disown him and his partner (nor their children, our grandchildren) - we respect them and their choices and pray for them and love them, and they respect us and our choices. Hopefully the hurt of marital failure will be healed, and he will not allow one failure to blight the rest of his life. I am equally sure that God loves and accepts him/them as they are more than we do. He/they know that we love and trust them, which is what God asks of us.

The health labour adjustment plan put hundreds of millions of dollars into job security plans that were supposed to encourage employees to gain education but due to the disincentive of wage compression (little difference between unskilled and skilled pay schedules) few actually took advantage of that part of the plan.  Little of that money went into patient care and now we have one of the most expensive health systems in the world with inverse outcomes compared to places like Singapore and Taiwan.  There is incredible job security for completely incompetent and/or unmotivated people.  But Clark has sold out to developers and foreign RE investors.

0,"Greenpeace does not have expertise in forecasting asian oil demand.  Financing a project has nothing to do with Greenpeace's resolve.  Greenpeace questioning Kinder Morgan's investment decision based on oil demand is like someone who doesn't like fighting in hockey, telling Sidney Crosby how to play.  The product will be burned up, whether it comes from Canada or Saudi Arabia.  Therefore, climate-change concerns are irrelevant.  The business that supplies the demand of a legal product should be able to conduct its business under fair and reasonable rules and processes.  Rather, the person who chooses to create the demand for a product that has negative side effects should be the one mainly penalized (i.e. taxed -- as with tobacco and alcohol).  Greenpeace members support in creating this demand as they too enjoy a great and healthy lifestyle due to fossil fuels, whether they choose to believe it or not.

0,"Really? I don't have much hope in the Conservatives either. More career politicians and their entourage will only get us more of the same. I can sympathize with the people that voted for Trump. Giving every policy issue a left or right answer is NOT the best way. I would prefer a pragmatic party that does the best for the citizens - not what passes the sniff test for their ideology. I don't see that happening, so I struggle to see anyone to support. The Conservatives may be more business friendly (bias alert - I own multiple businesses), but Harper's focus on security when crime levels are low, gagging scientists, and creating pet income tax deductions for his voter base was alarming too. Conservatives are no better than Liberals, just the other side of the same taxpayer's coin.

It's hard to label someone as irresponsible because they are sick, disabled, or injured.

When land transfer taxes, the double dip they've been living on dries up, how will they be able to afford paying consultants and shady contractors $150,000 for a set of stairs (not a huge stair case by the way, at most 5 steps).  Granted they did 'lower' the cost to $10,000 but imagine the billions that have been stolen and looted, now that the cupboard is going to be soon be bare, it's time to go after these crooks and get our money back.  Sadly no one is that naive, it's too late, your taxes are going up, spending is going up, no savings or cost efficiencies will be implemented at any level of government.

Bring a few board games, or find ways to deepen friendship and time together.  -morning walks with this child who rises early -making dinner with this child who may be prone to selfishness; they can learn to serve others cheerfully  Don't look at vacation as a time of not doing anything!

0,"You mean a real war monger. The point - aside from the one on the top of your head - is that Syria did nothing directly to us.  And while the gas attack was reprehensible, there was no urgent need to bomb Syria, certainly not without getting Congressional approval. The point is that Trump has his finger on the red button, and his impulsivity is a detriment and a danger to the entire world. The point is that Putin is on record militarily supporting Assad and invading other countries, and Trump says not one word about that. The point is that Trump is using this horrible situation to draw attention away from the Russia investigation, and maybe put a little fake space between himself and Putin for a minute forcthe same reason.

0,"2/3 or 4 We need to be able to hold with respect all of the perspectives different people have on the same situation in our minds at the same time, for Jesus obviously sees and hears and understands all of the different perspectives people have on the same situation.  Can we take abortion as an example?  As Catholics we have certainty that human beings are immortal, we simply cannot and will not cease to exist, and we believe that status is granted to us by a direct act of God while we are in the womb. Since immortality is for us a defining characteristic of what it means to be human, we are appalled and horrified by the idea of taking life in the womb.  But what about those who do not agree with us that human beings are immortal? If one seriously takes this perspective, then life in the womb is not yet fully human life, for the defining characteristics of being human from this perspective are not yet fully in place. Fetuses are evolving towards human life, but are not there yet.

0,"The State Constitution establishes that pension benefits are a contractual obligation and the AKSC has held that earned benefits cannot be diminished.   That said, it is pretty well established that contracts can be reformed by courts or other entities where one party demonstrably cannot perform.   The State's problem would be that it could never really demonstrate that it cannot perform so long as the Permanent Fund exists.   I'm not foolish enough to think that the ever-altruistic citizenry would amend the Constitution to access the corpus to pay my retirement benefits, but the Dividend only has a statutory existence, so as long as the Permanent Fund is making any money, PERS/TRS retirees have first dibbs  on the earnings, all of the earnings, on it should it be necessary to pay retirement benefits, and I take comfort in the fact that the judge(s) deciding the case are in a State retirement system too.

0,"Perhaps the perceived infringement of Second Amendment rights is a matter of degree. Most, I think, would agree that felons, mentally ill, and children should not have access to firearms. However, there appears to be a movement afoot to ban not only the AR-15 style rifle but also all semiautomatic firearms. In my opinion, that is going too far and likely would do nothing to prevent mass shootings as just took place in Orlando. It would infringe on the rights of only the law abiding and leave them at a significant disadvantage.

0,"No, In-my-view, they weren't. The NDP government's economic performance, during a time of global recession, was far better than that of the Campbell and Clark governments. The disinformation campaign perpetrated by Campbell is well documented, yet BC Liberal supporters continue to perpetuate the false myth of NDP mismanagement. In truth, the NDP left a record surplus and low debt. Both Campbell and Clark practice dishonest financial management in which there is obvious under-funding of operational needs coupled with rapidly increasing capital debt ($80+ Billion) that's shuffled off to Crown Corporations like BC Hydro. With all that unrecoverable debt, BC is in fact in terrible financial shape. It's clear the BC Liberal government has been playing a shell game with government finances.

Let's not forget that our church is still very anti female and likely will always be so. The church is very Republican- like and has always been that way. That is also very unlikely to change. Pope Francis may be less so but the American Catholic prelates are very unlikely to ever be less anti-female. It just seems to be in their DNA. I think a lot of them are crippled in that way. It sure seems to be a Freudian-like mindset. There also seems to be a narcissistic component and a male fear like component to a great many of them.

The Soviet Gulag of which Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote in his novel, """"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"""", as well as the entire Stalin era, embodied evil on a mass scale.

Considering the amount of success he's had, it certainly wasn't a detriment.  Now, however, having """"relocated"""" to the Oval Office, he's been unmasked. For the first time in his life, Trump is in a situation where it's not all about what HE says or thinks and it's upsetting his applecart.

We need to change this law that keeps us from knowing how much us paid to each company with tax credits. This is ridiculous. We're not talking about thousands of dollars, not even millions, this is billions of dollars our state is paying companies to setup business in the state.

Islamophobia, because it can mean simply a dislike of Islam, or a dislike of certain aspects of Islam, should not be condemned along with racism or bigotry, which are both unambiguously undesirable attitudes.  For example, someone may feel that the Islamic burqa is an obstacle to integration. Should that person be condemned and put in the same bucket as racists and bigots?

But,  assuming Alaska magically had an economic and social system just like Norway.  Nirvanna in America.  Would 5 million people move here from the lower 48?  Can the current 400,000 people actually earning in Alaska pay 50% of their earnings to Alaska?  Would Alaskan families happily hand over their children to the State to raise? How many people would the welfare State of Alaska be able to afford? If you think Alaska is expensive now,  wait till everything is free.

The only reason I was able to do it was that I was buying the place from my sister. When my income declined I had to bail out. Don't remember about property taxes but the interest deduction was so low that I just took the standard deduction, so I really didn't get a break.  In the early 1980s a friend was buying a simple house in Springfield. She borrowed the down payment, which she wasn't supposed to do to qualify for the loan but I guess the bank didn't check. She told me that among her acquaintances who were buying houses, all of them borrowed the down payment from their parents. I never had that option.

No abortion drama is ever rightly lived out unless all three of its main characters are treated positively in a meaningful way. How many times is that done now? The answer to that question is: Almost never. Instead, the mother is made victim, the father is scorned as scum, and the child is discarded as something worthless that never happened. Consequently, loving relationships are destroyed, and lifelong angers and regrets take root in their ashes.  That is the status quo, and that does not work.  My proposal treats all three of an abortion drama's main characters with dignity and respect.  The mother controls her body and her destiny, the father publicly accepts responsibility for his part in the pregnancy, and the child gets a name and therefore becomes a human being who is also a person in the eyes of the law.

We have zero tolerance for drinking and driving (even a small amount) and we have discussions about the difference between social drinking and binge drinking. Every family should examine their own behavior around alcohol, assess their own child and then decide what makes sense. Personally I would never """"bring the party home"""" because that promotes binge drinking, which is extremely dangerous.

The state foots the bill and this money isn't available for instruction and curriculum: it my view this is not acceptable.

I have ask the legislature to jointly proclaim alcohol a dangerous drug and advise people to avoid it, and have been met with refusal. The net loss equals the governor's veto of PFD dollars.

0,"Unfortunately it is not so simple... If you are closer to retirement I think it should be fine to hold some dividend stocks though if they are Canadian stocks and in RRSP you will  loose the tax advantage. If they are in taxable account and you do not like them anymore you may have to pay capital gains if you sell them. If you are not close to retirement and have a job you will pay tax on dividends though Canadian dividends have an advantage. Also in the taxable account the Canadian dividends  increase your total income and may affect your OAS or GIS. Anyway in the long term I doubt that any dividend grow stock (including the dividend) may beat the index .

Throughout the 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's the government of Ontario kept a massive amount of debt off government books by keeping it on the books of Ontario Hydro instead.  Of course Ontario Hydro was 100% owned by the government so taxpayers will still entirely on the hook, but by hiding the debt it made the provincial numbers artificially look better.  Mike Harris corrected this in 1999, moving $20B of government out of hiding and properly accounting for it. Now, less than 2 decades later, our government wants to go back to this deceptive practice?

You're ignoring that Klein nuked AHC premiums, along with a bunch of other fees for services that gutted provincial incomes, and you'll ignore that US sources of shale oil weren't online in 2003 as cheaper competition, and you'll ignore the Saudis dumping oil on purpose to drive down incomes below replacement on a lot of Alberta projects. You think any oil player in Fort MacMurray was building a project with a $95/bbl break even point in 2003, like Suncor has going right now up there?  Part of the issue is government, and now the PCs relied heavily on resource revenues, but some of it is corporate greed. Who PLANS to have $95/bbl oil?

You said such things as he needed a new brain and you, Klastri, called me a liar for defending Dr. Carson.  This is what another famous American said about slaves and immigrants:  “….So life in America was not always easy.  It wasn’t always easy for new immigrants.  Certainly, it wasn’t easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet in their own way were immigrants themselves.  There was discrimination and hardship and poverty.  But, like you, they no doubt found inspiration in all those who had come before them.  And they were able to muster faith that, here in America, they might build a better life and give their children something more.""""  Surprise, surprise.

0,"The circumstances and effects of the Obama action in respect of Iran were completely different from Trump's actions.  Obama’s Iraqi visa policy in 2011 did not ban Iraqis from entering the country. Obama’s immigration policy did not treat people with passports from the seven countries as unusually dangerous terrorism threats. And Obama’s policies never approached anything like the breadth, cynicism, and incompetence of Trump’s executive order.  It was discovered databases of fingerprints from Iraqi militants Iraq were not well-integrated into the broader State Department–run refugee admissions process. As a result, the Obama administration initiated a new review of all roughly 57,000 Iraqis refugees who had been recently admitted into the United States. this in place was extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the rate of Iraqi refugee entry into the United States slowed dramatically for the six months it took to finish the review but Iraqi refugees still arrived - no ban.

May noted that """"While we have made significant progress in recent years, there is – to be frank – far too much tolerance of extremism in our country."""" She went on to say that her country requires a frank and uncomfortable discussion about the roots of terrorism, suggesting that the communities from which the attackers are emerging are too self-segregated and too often broadly reject British values, particularly pluralism. It's inaccurate to hold that these attackers are essentially victims of actions perpetrated by others. Majority populations in the West are tiring of this nostrum. It's time to move to direct and honest debate, even if that's uncomfortable. May's assessment is correct.

The royal theocratic rulers of Saudi Arabia bought the US many years ago, shortly after oil was discovered there in mass quantities. In exchange our politicians and military keep their mouths shut about the human rights crimes committed by the Saudi's while simultaneously criticizing other countries like Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, etc. for exactly the same behavior! Our hypocrisy has real life consequences! And we wonder why anyone would commit a terrorist crime against us or why groups like ISIS are so successful at attracting membership.

The Tenth Amendment States """"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""""  Since the Constitution specifically delegates the power of Immigration and Naturalization to Congress (and enforcement to the Executive) the Tenth Amendment is not applicable in this case.

0,"William, you have expressed a logical fallacy.  That we should have built it.  If we had built it """"back then"""", the city would have been doing so at the expense of other core services which the city is failing to upkeep now (such as roads and sewers).  Secondly, once running, the rail will have a massive bill for operations and maintenance.  Also, had we built it """"long ago"""", areas of the rail would need upgrading and rebuilding.  The ongoing cost of rail is not one that is self sufficient.  It will always rely on more tax money to keep running.   I will add that not a single public works rail project in the US has ever met the ridership projections and Oahu will not be the first.   That will also trigger the need for the city to raise taxes to subsidize the riders.  Even back in the 70's and 80's when Mr Fasi proposed rail, it was already too late because there was no land east of Ewa to build a rail line on.

0,"Re Medical malpractice, one of the largests costs re health care is the high cost of medical malpractice insurance, which is passed on to the paying customer, as everything is.  Often the defendants insurance companies  settle bogus claims because it is cheaper than the court costs.  *IF* we really wanted to lower health costs, we would mandate that any lawsuits filed, and then thrown out by the courts would result in full reimbursement costs to be borne by the suing party. Owed in full.  A legit case would go forward, but the ambulance chasing type lawsuits would mostly be stemmed.  That is what I mean.

There was a huge campaign for shareholder votes prior to his ascension, since many on the Board thought he would be too aggressive with cost cutting. I cashed out when I thought he had squeezed every last cent he could. and did very well. But while I made out well, he ultimately hurt the long term sustainability for the company because the mode of compensation favours high quarterly gains rather than continuing viability. This, coupled with the fact that few crumbs are left for working level employees, is why I am not in favour of the way in which CEOs are currently compensated.

1,"Dan Sullivan is a minion of Trump and a strategic Republican. He's also in collusion with Trump to twist a yes vote from Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski will not back down from bullying. As well far right wingers troll here and talk down to people, insult those with an opinion but in the end when you listen you dont hear anything like their support for a 'better' health plan when it amounts to a tax break for the mega rich. Dan Sullivan could care less if Alaskans have access to healthcare. He's not from Alaska and his resident state is on the east coast. He sounds like if he waves his arms enough fanning the flames of fear he might get a position in the west wing.  I appluad Lisa for having the guts to try and do what is right for her constituents by not following the party lines for the sake of Donald Putin and attempting to secure access to healthcare for ALL Alaskans. I don't think trying to bully her around isnt going to work. She is Alaskan and is showing it right now. Kudos Lisa!!

If the words """"Tax Break"""" weren't in their policy then they would have one. Well tax breaks only work when you have really high taxes and that road block was removed decades ago. So now what tax breaks mean is more money for the rich who hide it offshore and less for those not as fortunate.

0,"The leverage cycle, that has only worsened since the financial crisis, coupled with structural unemployment, are the two key economic challenges in the West - (US, Canada, UK, EU)  Politicians of all stripes are reticent to address either however,  as they rely on borrowing to win votes on the one hand, and promising to reverse job losses in manufacturing on the other, carefully avoiding blaming the unemployed themselves.  Honestly addressing these two issues, with unskilled workers taking some responsibility for their plight, is essential in moving forward.  This is especially true in an upward rate environment, with higher interest costs.  That stock volatility and  direction will be affected in the first 100 days is less certain as a strong Dollar, few attractive investment alternatives and a world of index huggers and crowded trades looks to persist.

So if the women can safely wear a bikini, then as a public place, they have a right. Applying the same rule, one could complain to the bikini wearer that it was inappropriate and be rightly upset. But since it is a public place, what could one do?  The trouble is workers are captive audiences (unless one believes they should just quit if they don't like how they must dress of how someone else dresses). They are paid for their time too.

For men to act so outside their natures, serving others with a cheerful heart, must be taken as a sign that God is somehow involved, and so serves as a compelling sign of God's presence in the Church. The ongoing miracle of men acting decently...

Perhaps now in the midst of the biggest fiscal crisis in the last 40 years, the politicians should use some foresight in preparing the budget for the future.  For example, include a sunset provision on any new taxes so that as the states oil income rises in the future the degree or kinds of taxes are reduced or even eliminated. Amen.

The ones who haven't signed Trump-like non-disclosure agreements. Ask about the company 'policies' up on the wall. Any one of which is more regressive and demeaning to the lower employees than the last. They foment an atmosphere of 'dog-eat-dog' among senior staff. They hold Republican find-raisers on company propery and time, 'inviting' the senior staff to attend. The plebes are invited on their time off.

0,"As a child growing up in eastern Canada, I distinctly remember my father talking about how important the Combines Investigation Act was for Canadian enterprise. At that time, when the multinationals' share of foodstuffs was perhaps even higher than it is today, there were rules and regulations governing origin of product labelling, and more importantly the amount of eye level display the cartel could monopolize. My children have all grown up with this lesson in mind, and because the labelling requirements seem less stringent today, they do their own research. Buying local creates employment in our communities and wastes less energy in transporting products to market. A pretty simple concept, that we all can follow simply by taking the time.  It's our own way of pushing back against anti-Canadian trade sanctions by our neighbour to the south.

0,"Myanmar (Burma) as a country hasn't lost its sovereign borders. What's happened is that the government of Myanmar has abdicated its authority to govern.

Though it has a population larger than Canada's, the neighbouring country of Bangladesh is impoverished. We can't put all the responsibility on them. This is a crisis that calls for direct action from a neutral country. Canada should step up.

Many studies - even the politically skewed one done by the Senate Majority earlier in the session - show that the public is strongly behind a broad based legislative solution to our fiscal dilemma, an opinion which was promptly ignored by the Legislature. What the people want is to not have to bear the entirety of the fiscal burden we face.

It was so hard to do especially since my son was with one of him all the way to the helicopter and my son, as his Sgt. felt responsible because he thought he had failed him in some way. I also think that everything General Kelly said, from the VERY beginning to the end when he left the podium is something people should hear, in its entirety, before criticizing Kelly or Trump. My son told me the same thing that I should remember if he was killed there. Guess that is standard Marine line but very true too. If you heard what Kelly said that was in reference to his other experience with the same Congresswoman, it makes sense that people are angry at her for using a death AGAIN politically. Trump might have been better to have his wife call the fallen man's wife. Next time he should stick to a letter.

Victims for Justice can not represent victims as attorneys. How would you like it if defense counsel demanded your psych/medical records as a victim to try and claim you are not credible? Or to turn over your entire contents on your cell phone? This all becomes public record if granted, and mind you, it usually is. That is what OVR has been set up for, to ensure that the privacy and rights of the victims are upheld. The prosecution does not advocate for the victims, their only job is to notify if there is a hearing which they now source a third party program to do that. This program will only notify about certain hearings, and sometimes after the hearing has happened. Here is more about the constitutional rights for victims: https://ovr.akleg.gov/rights.php.

The map at crosscountryalaska.org seems geared toward skiers specifically, and I couldn't find a map that had the functionality I wanted -- namely, photos added to posts from each area.  I'm not claiming originality, but a map like this was a resource that I personally, as someone who gets outside as much as possible, thought would be useful in making sure we all go out prepared for the conditions.

So that when you have a rare disease, there is hope that the market found it worthwhile to develop a treatment.   That might mean that when you have medical issues, money is a worry.   You get scary bills.   But you have hope.   If the treatment is available, but the money is not, that can be fixed.   If the health care is free, but the government doesn’t permit you to receive it…well, that’s a cruelty we don’t want to see replicated in the United States.

China loves the money our consumers give them for inexpensive products. China will slap down Porky if it's economic interests are threatened, and India and Vietnam would love to have the kind of business we give China.  Second, announce a major initiative towards nuke-interception. Reagan got respect with talk about SDI, and we certainly have better technology now. The ability to nullify Porky's nukes (and anyone else's) will stabilize the whole region, preventing Japan and South Korea from pursuing their own nukes. We're already working on the concept, so step it up.

For the last two decades, almost all lithium production was destined for batteries in consumer electronics. During that time there has bee no major environmental spills or ongoing contamination. No human rights violations and no oil wars.  The main reason that lithium mining is so innocuous is that annual production is less than 1/100,000th of oil. Not to mention it is reusable in grid storage and recyclable.  Once you place battery production in proper context, it is impossible to conclude that it is more of a environmental hazard than burning 100's of millions of barrels of oil per day

I can't imagine he was, but a jury couldn't make such a finding in the absence of evidence. The case would have cost a huge amount of money to prosecute and it only takes one juror to fail to reach a unanimous verdict, necessitating at least one retrial. It looks as though there have been dozens of motions and hearings in the last 18 months. There may have been a problem with chain of evidence, which could jeopardize any conviction. His prior record was minor, save for a 2007 DUI in which a $3,000 fine appears to have been waived. I wonder if he went to ASAP, and if he was mandated to go to treatment?

As Chait puts it, """"traditional measures do not capture the most profound changes he has wrought."""" Chait calls it """"ethonationalism."""" Steve Bannon is key to that. Chait continues, """"In both words and deeds, the White House has established the federal government as the defender of white power in America, projecting a blunt-force message of zero-sum dominance."""" As Russia is seen by some as a white bulwark against the invasion of dark Islam, Trump's Russian infatuation makes sense. It's a pity so few people see this.

When Hollande talked about a 75% tax rate, this was a definite encouragement to leave, and also the proximity of the London financial market didn't hurt either. And as for the first vote result, what looks really bad is the total percentage of socialist voters as compared to the vote for M. Fillon, with a communist running just behind  François Fillon. Whose program included cutting 500,000 government sector jobs.  This alone would have been enough to sink his candidacy by three  or four percentage points, enough to have put him ahead of M.

In the East historically the remarried were not allowed to commune, this excommunication was reduced to a number of years towards the end of the millennium, despite consensus in both east and west that it was a sin.  The problem is not divorce or separation the problem is remarriage.  If you believe the one, holy, apostolic and Catholic Church of the first millennium is the East than why are you not Orthodox?

Harper exacerbated the inflationary period just before the predicted slow down. The slow down came and we fell farther than we would have  done, and we had no cushion, and we had nothing left in the tank.  To say Harper fixed it after he broke it is a pretty specious claim. The point is, he broke it.

IM has become a political mindset, serving powerful, behind-the-scenes interests. It has taken over the department and board to an unhealthy extent.

0,"Lincon wasn't just warning us against guys like Trump. He was warning us against politicians like 95% of our current elected representatives from congress to the senate to the presidency. He would likely be disgusted with the lies of most of the politicians, including Trump and Hillary,  as he was known for being honest Abe. He certainly would not of been for interfering with foreign affairs, i.e. A constant state of global war. He certainly would not be for taxing working class, giving loopholes for rich to not pay taxes, and allow for a system that has so much walefare. He certainly would not of been for trade deals that make moving businesses overseas more profitable than creating employment in the states. He certainly wouldn't be for the communistic style of democracy where government decides what we consume and punishes people for their consumption choices. I would venture to guess that Honest Abe would not endorse 95% of our elected officials.

0,"Sadly, there's no escaping the fact - fact, not opinion or assertion - that terror threats across the world emerge primarily from Islamic roots.  It wasn't always that way, of course. In the early/mid 20th century the religious wellspring of unrest were the alliances between the Catholic right wing and Euro-fascism. In the 1960/1970 era in Northern Ireland, it was primarily Protestant extremists.  To be sure, there are localized threats and actions made by fundamentalist right-wing groups in the US and other places, and they need to be taken seriously. But those threats aren't part of a world-wide movement like Islamic Jihad is.

0,"A primary reason that the CBO overestimated the number of people who would enroll in ObamaCare is that it underestimated the number of Republican governors who would oppose the Medicaid expansion. 24 Republican governors, motivated solely by a desire to sabotage Obamacare, declined roughly $423 billion in Federal funds when they refused to expand Medicaid and, in doing so, they drove up premiums for private insurance and caused somewhere between 5,700 and 17,000 preventable deaths each year in their states. Those 24 governors comprised a de facto death panel.

0,"Moderate doesn't mean anything to these people. In fact, the more careful and sensible the person, the more infuriated they become. The problem is that even moderate views are deeply threatening to fundamentalists. One example might be Brown's observation that the wedding feast at Cana is not about a wedding, but about messianic revelation and the nature of  Christ's relationship to his mother: “Neither the external nor the internal evidence for a symbolic reference to matrimony is strong. The wedding is only the backdrop and occasion for the story, and the joining of the man and woman does not have any direct role in the narrative.”  Yet for those anxious to link this passage with """"God made them male and female"""" and """"for this reason a man shall leave . . . """" and the bride and bridegroom and all the rest of it, this suggestion will never do. Scripture must point in the direction they say it points in.

0,"In general, there are benefits and problems with sprawl and compact growth. Neither is perfect. How one emphasizes the good and bad of each is where the arguments rise. Sprawl offers cheap land (often productive farmland), lowering building costs while providing more open development with single family housing that many people enjoy and even see as a sign of """"making it"""". Neighborhoods also have more control over the social climate with more homogeneity. But it also requires large amounts of land, longer commute times (pollution and cost), longer bus routes, longer distances to provide city services and often a sense of isolation (some people like that). Compact growth saves arable land, encourages alternative transit, reduces pollution, increases a neighborhood feel, is less costly for city services, adds diversity and supports local retail. But it creates congestion, makes parking more difficult, forces encounters with """"strange"""" people,  & housing is often costly. Which is better?

Let's not confuse it with personal income where allowance for deductions is far more limited.  The two are very different in terms of how they are taxed.

Regular businesses pay tax on net income regardless of whether it was retained or not.

I find the drive to tinker with the system that has served us well for over 200 years based on discontent over Trump to be unfortunate.  Naturally, the democrats support this move because the small population western states tend to vote Republican and they have a slightly higher weight in the electoral college.

The US dollar is unlikely to move sufficiently to offset its impact to the US consumer, nor are factories likely to return quickly enough to provide jobs to stave off the impacts of high inflation to the poorest Americans.

Singling out and killing a sole pack of wolves (including their puppies), for instance, can almost immediately boost a caribou population in danger of extinction.

We can cheat and Google it, but the definition, due to some very historic civil rights legislation, is far more inclusive than it would have been in the 18th century; it doesn't now mean just (white) men of a certain age.  And another factoid:  due to historic precedent, the militia most certainly ain't today's National Guard.  We can also cherry-pick what countries we regard as """"civilized"""" who have stricter, more onerous, or draconian gun control laws compared to us.  You would be remiss, however, if you fail to recognize that other nation-states such the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, plus many now defunct states such as Nazi Germany and the later German Democratic Republic all think (or thought) of themselves as pretty civilized too.

Now of the criminal is a juvenile, it's even worse! They can commit very adult crimes like felony theft, burglaries, robberies, felony assaults, and stealing cars but if under 18, just get released to their coddling or clueless parents. In fact I heard a lot of times the police can not even bring a juvenile in to the police station or any holding area because it will traumatize our delicate flowers regardless if they 70 year old lady was traumatized when she was pushed and her purse ripped off her arm.  Other states laugh at us when they hear that our criminals have 80-120 prior arrests running around in our neighborhoods. A relative told me that they had a thief take an unattended purse from a woman but had to have knowledge of how much money there was inside so only the value of the purse was used. Knowledge? Really?

These tests are never perfect, and will result in many false positives, and will result in many innocent citizens having to spend enormous sums of money in order to claim their innocence.  Not even the Conservatives (not a fan of the last government) would have come up with such a plan.

You did mention our infamous former governor, Sarah Palin, Queen of Per Diem.

The present GDP growth rate at present is typical of the growth rate since Bush's crash (despite GOP efforts repeatedly to sabotage the economy). Fact is: GDP growth has been steadily decelerating since Carter was in office 40 years ago (more mature economy, older population, etc.).  Right-wing hacks think the economy has gotten better suddenly; left-wing hacks see a  depression around every economic warble. The statistics say things remain the same (for better or worse).  Perhaps you were just confused given how deep the hole was. Financial panics, unlike typical recessions, undermine confidence, which in turn takes years to overcome (not that GOP austerity didn't do real damage too).

If subsidization is a matter of public policy, the costs should be spread across all of society through the tax system.  Restricting landlords to rent increases that don't even cover the actual increases in taxes, hydro, water, gas etc. is unfair.  Sure. everyone hates the large corporate landlords.  But some landlords are mom and pop operations--maybe a triplex, one unit of which they live in.  And tenants may in fact be richer than landlords.  If a tenant chooses to use his salary for consumer goods, cars. restaurant meals, travel, etc., why should a less-wealthy landlord be required to subsidize the tenant's lifestyle choices?

0,"Dear Rule and Raven, I believe most Catholics, lay and cleric, assume that a properly formed conscience is always in harmony with the teaching of the magisterium and, therefore, a man in a same sex marriage is living in a state of sin.  I question the assumption.  For one thing, I believe the entire cosmos is theophany and that the sciences can tell us as much about the will of God as can Scripture.  What we read in the Bible is an account of how people have interpreted revelation and that interpretation is conditioned by what they already believed as taught and understood in their own cultures.  As our scientific understanding of humanity deepens through science, I believe we have to accept that past understandings do not represent the """"Will of God"""" as much as the understanding (or misunderstanding) of humans.  It is high time to review the magisterium's  understanding in light of modern science as well as developments in the study of Scripture.

0,"there is a rational debate that people can have regarding the purging of imagery from a historical period with dark associations. To do that however requires people to accept that not all imagery of a historical period should be judged by the same criteria  Robert E Lee for example was not a secessionist and was offered by Lincoln, a command post with the Union just before the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln, perhaps the most revered of US presidents,  clearly did not consider Lee to be a man of ignoble character.  And Lincoln was clear, if he could save the union by maintaining those slaves then in bondage, he was prepared to do it, but he was not prepared to allow for slavery's expansion west.  Lee may be a representation of more than the institution of slavery, or he may not be, depending upon the circumstances attending to the monuments in his honour...to discuss the issue however requires honesty and trust , and those qualities seem in short supply in the US these days

0,"And I would respectfully disagree with St. John Paul the Great on this issue--as I respectfully disagree with Pope Francis. Pope Francis, though is more radical than JPII.  I don't by JPII's logic.  Some hardened killers continue to kill from prison. The fact that they do this demonstrates that they cannot be safely locked up and must be put to death in order to protect society. Osama Ben Laden also, I think qualifies as a good example of someone who needed to be executed in order to protect society.  As for Pope Francis, he is trying to claim that the the death penalty is an intrinsic moral evil. This claim is simply wrong. Being for or against the death penalty is a prudential judgement.

A negative right to assisted dying is far more temperate.

Korean President openly requested bilateral talks with NK and was uniformly rebuffed. Japan, S.Korea and U.S. have gotten nowhere with Kim JungUn and his regime.

Do we really have over 4900 vacant homes in the county and only 953 vacation rentals? As noted earlier, how many of the 41% (5584) owner-occupied homes are only used by the owners and their family/friends? Since vacation home permits are for life, how are they actually monitored? What about short-term rentals over 31 days that do not require any permit? Are the short-term rentals (over 31 days, but not year-round) reflected in the percentage of rental-occupied homes? I'm assuming they are, so how does that actually affect the availability of rental units available for full-time residents? These are all questions that I hope will be answered by the Planning Department.  To those who seem to think there is no impact by vacation homes on the communities where they are located...try living next to a 5-bedroom party house.

Thus, Bernie could have run as an Independent, and if he didn't win nationally, his votes could have gone to the Democrats.  I usually don't blame the candidates though. The system forces them to grab for tons of cash by not saying some things and pandering around saying things they may not really believe. Not many people would go through the national election process. Look at the intense scrutiny that they have to endure, and look at the danger that they have to face every day. They are brave to run.

0,"What’s wrong here is the premise that long term care insurance is defined as costly. This ruins the desire of people to buy a policy and guarantee that they have coverage for their future long term care needs.  Long term care insurance doesn’t have to be expensive. According to AARP and ALTCP,  you can save on premiums if you make a purchase early and personalize your policy based on your needs. Adjusting your policy features like making your elimination period longer and decreasing your daily benefit can help lower your premiums. But just make sure that you still have enough coverage for your future needs.  Long term care is not limited to nursing home, which is known to be very expensive. Home care is a more affordable option likewise adult day care and assisted living facility. Considering these facilities can also help lower your premiums.

The fact that McGee only had two years left on his contract was an issue (and then the fact that McGee wasn't very good in 2016 was another) but the trade never really bothered me. But some folks who followed the minors more closely than I did suggested that Marquez could end up as the best player in that trade, and right now those people look like they know what they're talking about. I'm sure the Rays are happy with Dickerson, but from the Rockies perspective Marquez's breakout turns this trade from an OK one to a potentially fantastic one.

Since many coming into Toronto are professionals, the impact is probably greater than 40% 2) Toronto receives massive grants for both the federal and provincial governments, which means that all people in Ontario and Canada send money to Toronto, but the important part is that both the median and average income of those that live in he 905 exceeds that of Toronto, meaning there is a net flow of income from the 905 to Toronto. 3) We in the 905 throw billions towards such things as the Pan Am games with little coming back. 4) Finally, if Tory doesn't want us to use """"his"""" roads, we would be happy not to.

I've yet to hear any apology from the Catholic Bishops for their active role in Russia's strategy. It always puzzled me why the Bishops thought it was appropriate to comment on an email exchange they had no business looking at. And in doing so they were playing exactly the same role they accused Clinton's staffers of playing: using the church to promote a partisan political cause.

If we get married, Conservative Baptists teach that our marriages a cause of """"grief"""".  All this is public information.

The opioid epidemic disaster declaration by the governor is purely to bring in unmarked federal government health care money to be used in anyway the state feels fit so long as a percentage of the money can be traced back to opioid treatment and prevention. Whatever is left goes into the healthcare budget. Do you really think that the people of this state would not cut off the true cure for opioid and whatever drug comes next (school education funds, dividends, Denali Kid Care, drug abuse prevention and such)? Opioid abuse did not become a epidemic until 30 year old white women with back twinges got their greedy doctor to over prescribe them. And Narcan is not a new drug. It's been around since before I started in the ER in the late 1980's. Check the stats alcohol is Alaska's problem. I also drink responsibly.

Then he did his best to undermine NATO on his recent trip to Europe as well as supporting Brexit.  Russia's number one goal since the end of WWII has been to bust up NATO and the EU. Trump is helping Putin realize those goals. Now he's withdrawing from the Paris Accord, and leaving the Chinese to assume the role of world leadership on climate change.

0,"Please check out a few recent histories of both Pearl Harbor and the Lusitania: - Pearl Harbor - most historians show that FDR was moving the US towards war and thus failed to adequately have forces notified or alert to Japanese intentions.  FDR's Japan Policy cut Japan off from all fuels, iron ore, etc. that would have allowed Japan to expand normally.  Most historians do not focus on this contributing factor.  But very few recognized historians show that FDR, staff, etc. knew or expected a sneak attack. Robert Stinnett - Day of Deceit - poses warning of the attack was on FDR's desk  - Lusitania - the best historical studies indicate that the Lusitania was carrying arms violating the German warning.  This was part of the unofficial US policy to help arm and feed Great Britain.  See Erik Larson's Dead Wake - Did the British Admiralty fail to provide a naval escort for the Lusitania because its likely sinking would draw the U.S. into the war?  Unable to answer that question.

It is all about whether a conviction can be obtained or not - too bad if he or she is innocent.

They want to believe that the people they put in power have a solid vision and the skills it will take to make them a reality. We want evidence that we are in good hands. Even Governor Ariyoshi, famous for being quiet but effective, spoke forcefully on issues of economic development and preservation. Ige saying that he is not media savvy is a dodge; he ignores the people around him who are. I am certain that someone is giving him good advice on being more visible but he just plain doesn't want to. The bottom line is that he wants the voters to think he's a nice guy who has our best interests at heart, so let's just trust him; the reality is that he is a hard-headed technocrat who doesn't listen to others or amend his behavior to better suit his office.

0,"Having worked on many successful (meeting most of the intended goals and not having a catastrophic systems meltdown) public sector IT projects, I can say the flaws are thus:  1) Scope: this process is usually not done well and thus the agreement on goals is not clear. 2) Existing IT staff and departments feeling threatened by new tech and methods. Often they obstruct or sabotage. A room full of Windows PC guys being intimidated by a bunch of Mac newbies. 3) Budget: only a third of the budget should be spent on development: 2/3 needs to go on implementation, testing, and troubleshooting. Public sector organizations are complicted by their nature: you have to deal with deadbeat staff who have priviliges, you have to deal with complicated mandates, political interferance, political crises, etc. Not paying on time. 4: Getting hosed: because of all the above, pretty well every private sector player has a very cynical attitude to government contracts, and basically takes them for a ride.

In Sydney alone, robbery rates with guns rose 160% in one year.  Fact: A ten year Australian study has concluded that firearm confiscation had no effect on crimes, A separate report also concluded that Australia's 1996 gun control laws """"found no evidence for an impact of the laws on the pre-existing decline in firearm homicides.

If, by the current situation, you mean that AL gives the divorce and remarried much more leeway to prayerfully discern whether a first marriage was licit and valid, and then conduct themselves accordingly, that is very different than option one.  If, by the current situation, one means that AL can be interpreted to mean that even if a D&R person knows that his or her first marriage is valid, if the 'best one can do in a concrete situation' is to continue to engage in marital relations with the (putative) spouse, then that is OK, I think that is very different from the first two options in this post and very different from my original post.

0,"I am pro choice, like most in my generation.  But I still struggle with the idea that we have no law whatsoever governing abortion in Canada.  This is an abdication of responsibility by politicians of all stripes.  Every other developed nation in the world has had the political courage to address the question - when does life begin.  I don't have the answer, it is somewhere between conception and 9 months.  But we owe it to ourselves to address the question courageously as a nation and not just throw it back to the doctors and say - you decide for your own practice.   I know this is a topic most politicians dont want to touch with a 10 foot pole, but we should have a law.

0,"Al Hee was held accountable in the private sector by simple tax law violations.  Prosecuting under civil and common law for breaches of various duties is more time consuming, expensive and difficult.  Public sector has fair treatment and conflicts of interest rules and regulations that """"parallel"""" the private sector.  Although the context, $$quantification. and management are different comparing Hee privately and Apo publicly, the nature of """"rip-off"""" is the same.  Simply, you can't use your public position to elevate your community status and private business card.  While this applies to NGOs, govt imposes its own fair treatment and conflicts laws. So, 40 years public service while excusing oneself for a lack of training and """"I didn't know?""""  Settling by paying a cheap fine to avoid weighty criminal prosecution and declare innocence?  Then crying """"witch hunt"""" by a disgruntled beneficiary?  We see the political talent through 40 years public service.  Imagine,...40 years public service.

For years, Muslim followers of Islam have been attacking, maiming and killing innocent civilians in the Middle East, in Europe, in Australia, in Russia, in Asia, and in North America.  What is it that inspires, incites and leads Muslim followers of Islam to attack, maim and kill innocent civilians? Where do Muslim followers of Islam get the idea they must attack, maim and kill innocent civilians?

0,"Never stop telling it like it is. The biggest fear of people who love the U.S. is that media people will get tired of treating Donald Trump with the obvious contempt he so richly deserves. Unfortunately Mr. Trump's base isn't shy about pushing back and labeling any criticism of Mr. Trump as 'fake news'. However, losing Steve Bannon from his White House staff can only improve his decisions.

0,"There should NEVER be a zero% tax bracket... everyone needs to pay, if you make $1.oo a year, you should pay Income taxes on that dollar. And you should never receive more in a refund check than you paid in income tax. The IRS needs to get out of the business of handing out welfare checks - Earned income tax credits.

0,"I think housing does not contain an expressive component, whereas a cake can be legitimately expressive. We use it to express """"happy birthday,"""" """"congratulations"""", and so on. The argument he should have waited to find out what they wanted on the cake implies cakes can be expressive. Housing, on the other hand, is not expressive. So I don't support someone who tries to evict an interracial couple.

0,"You clearly know few people who come to this country to settle here.  I have known very many over many years, and I have heard none of them talking to Americans about anything that would remotely demonstrate a lack of gratitude for the opportunity to be here. Many people do find our customs strange and our language difficult to learn.  Nevertheless, they adapt, and their children become as American as anyone else. I don't know if you have any concept of how difficult it is to leave one's home and everything familiar in order to find safety or to be able to provide for one's family.  If the trauma that the immigrants suffer manifests itself in ways that offend you, then I am sorry for you. If one is to speak about being ungrateful and unappreciative, I would use native-born Americans as a prime example.  Close to a majority of them choose not to vote; many cheat on taxes.  That, to me is far greater evidence of a lack of gratitude than anything any immigrant might say.

0,"And in other news not found on the e-version of the R-G, the US Supreme court issued three (3) unanimous or per curiam rulings today without the presence of a Scalia replacement.  His death or absence made no difference whatsoever, despite Senator  Merkley's arguments at the U of O Law School that having only 8 Justices means the end of society as we know it.  One of them overruled an Obama administration case for overreaching in a water usage case and one of the others was, of course, yet another unanimous overturning of a 9th Circuit Court decision.  We are now up to thirty-seven (37) decisions by the US Supreme Court since Justice Scalia's death where his absence was irrelevant.

The same people who nagged on and on and on about where President Obama was born completely supported the Ted Cruz attempt to become president and Ted Cruz was born in Canada!

He even said himself that his supporters are so stupid that he can say and do anything and his supporters will still support him. He proves that fact every day.

0,"Donnie raised the topic of extremism, so let's take a look at the issue. Franz, an attorney for an environmental group, files lawsuits. Isn't that what attorneys are paid to do. I'm not in favor of the current climate of litigation that surrounds environmental issues, but that's also what opponents of environmental law do?  Mr. McLaughlin is a supporter of COWS. This group wants to return Federal lands to the States, which they believe will do a better job of managing the lands. Sounds good, but many organizations of hunters, fishermen, ATV riders, horsemen, and other outdoor enthusiasts, like the Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Partnership have called the bill an “overt attempt to undermine public land ownership.”  What these groups have discovered is that States are unable to afford to manage public lands, so they sell them off to private interests. Then public access is closed off and we are left with a """"pay to play"""" scenario for outdoor enthusiasts. Who is the extremist in this case?

Yes, there are other sources of information than Fox News or Rush Windbag or Breitbart.  Until these propagandist are exposed for their lies by Trump betraying you and your fellow Trumpist, we, the """"others"""" are saddled with a guy that has shown no respect for the Constitution.

So, you should ask -Raz- what he meant by """"we"""" and """"Alaska lifestyle."""" Now, my response to his comment was simply to remind him that Sen Sullivan has in fact """"lived here a few years"""" himself and has been formally instructed over those years by many people who grew up here, including his Native Alaskan in-laws (who are at least minimally qualified to be considered as a subset of """"true Alaskans"""" n'est pas?), how """"we live.""""  But, in the interest of being complete, I'll treat your nonsense question with more seriousness than it deserves and answer it. I would define a """"true Alaskan"""" as someone who has invested their time and heart into this state and seeks to better it and its people based on their own personal philosophies.
