0,"""""We will cut the size and cost of government by making every program and agency justify its existence and eliminate those that don't work.""""  This guy must be a complete moron.  All the stuff he said in that sentence is a direct consequence of laws that were written by the House/Senate and signed by the President.  It's a compliance issue, the governmental agencies are the ones charged with enforcement of those laws.  That in itself is the justification.  Well, I guess we could ignore all those pesky laws we don't like.

1,"Not for nothing, but I've had plenty of service employees talk to me like I'm an idiot. Bad customer service and crummy social skills are pretty gender neutral, Laureli, and confusing that with sexism is a bit of a stretch unless you view all forms of resistance through that particular lens. It's funny that you post this article today, because I just got home from Lowes where I spent 20 minutes arguing with an """"expert"""" over the required thickness of residential wiring. Very much a man, in my carharts and manly voice, yet this individual still felt at ease talking to me like a petulant five year old. So there you go.

0,"Michael: I'm not an expert on this but as far as naming goes, here in the Transkei, the only three names used are """"intsangu"""", """"icuba"""" (which includes tobacco) and """"ganja"""". """"Cannabis"""" is a Latin name and not widely used in SA until recently. """"Cannabis"""" also refers to hemp which can cause confusion - as can be seen in some of the comments here. """"Dagga"""", """"ganja"""", """"weed"""", etc are seen as slang words which wouldn't be appropriate in this type of article. Hence my choice of """"marijuana"""" as the most common name used globally to refer to the drug now being legalised for medical and recreational purposes.

0,"Fake news is bad enough, but fake facts is worse. The reasons Hillary lost are 50 years of growing anger about the rigged economy, continual disappearance of the middle class, the dysfunctional political system, the anger about the swamp of Establishment corruption in Washington. As a columnist for the media Establishment, Renzetti loses credibility in feigning innocence. Furthermore, what is it about the words """"elitist dynasty"""", Renzetti doesn't understand? Trump won and Bernie Sanders almost won because they were fresh faces, not career politicians, outsiders promising to shake up the Establishment. That's precisely what Americans, left, right and centre, want. """"I imagine there are jobs where an excess of expertise isn't useful, but I can't imagine U.S. president is one of them."""" No, no, Ms Renzetti. Clinton's expertise is in winning power, pretending to advance the progressive agenda, abandoning Democratic Party values and neglecting the people who counted on them.

0,"She just couldn't get on board with a measure that would peel back health care options for women, for any reason.    Isn't that one of the main problems that is causing the whole mess? No body is willing to see any of their benefit programs illuminated and so it keeps growing. It's easy to keep giving benefits to people when you don't see it coming out of your pocket, that's why it was so easy for the presidents to go on a big giveaway spree and so hard to shut it off. It's not just helping women but the hidden government program costs for every program and there aren't enough taxpayers to cover future and existing conditions.

0,"Sending youth on missions is a chance to expose youth to other cultures and see how the poor live but as far as being useful to the population of the missions visit is certainly up to debate.  Having a daughter that lived in Honduras and Chile for 7 years she witness up close the many groups of kids that came through.   You can only build and paint the churches so many times and in most cases the mission groups rarely even asked what the locals want to be done.  You have to remember that every branch of church sends mission to country they may have some interest in converting people to their faith.  The folks in Honduras in those days were much more interested in having a building constructed to store grain then another church constructed, you may recall these people do have a religion and were not in need to be converted.   The money that it took to send these kids to South Africa was huge you have to think it would have accomplished more to just give them the money instead.

As well, something like 1/3 of concussions happen at practice. This is not just a football or NFL issue. It sort of comes across as, well if you get concussions in middle school or high school or even college(in any sport) it is okay because the NFL is where it is really bad. Thankfully, more and more information is now available so people can make better choices on their desire to participate in sports.

0,"Two solutions seem reasonable: flush the line with nitrogen then with air pressure until they can fix the leak or put a cap over the leak like the Macondo Well in the Gulf.  Bring the gas to the surface and burn it off an anchored flare barge.  This would let the rigs continue to run on fuel gas.  Methane is a greenhouse gas more powerful than carbon dioxide. Not taking care of this leak is irresponsible on behalf of Hilcorp.  There will be more leaks as a bottom feeder like Hilcorp sucks the last drops of oil from the formations and puts this oil/gas in old corroded pipes. We Alaskans might as well get ready for this fact. The prior owners of Hilcorp pipelines were not too keen on wasting money on pigging, thus corrosion and leaks. I had a Technician from a pipeline integrity testing outfit working at Milne, tell me several years ago to """"not lean on any pipes, today or"""".  Meaning the plumbing should of had a tad more maintenance over the last 30 years, thanks BP accountants in London.

0,"Excellent article.  Only one thing that needs tweaking.  Questioning Glantz's aim, Mr. Bentley writes, """"...it is bizarre to imagine that slapping an R rating on movies will stop teens from seeing the kinds of movies that feature smoking.""""  But the call for an """"R"""" rating is mere cover for the real result.  """"PG"""" movies bring in all that family cash that """"R"""" movies do not.  By forcing an """"R"""" rating on what would, but for smoking, be a """"PG"""" movie, Glantz hopes to financially coerce the Motion Picture Assoc. into choosing dropping smoking scenes altogether instead of moving to an """"R"""" rating.  Glantz said this himself:  """"An adult content or """"R"""" rating for smoking in movies would not have much effect on the movies that children see because, unlike sex and violence, smoking in movies does not sell more tickets  Studios would simply stop putting smoking in movies aimed at an adolescent market.""""  --  Smoking in Movies: a major problem and a real solution.

You've served in plenty of high caliber appointed position inside and outside of Alaska, surely you can do better than beat around the bush.  The only new revenue that's been kicked around in op-eds is taxes:  Tax the PFD, income tax, education head tax ranging from $100-$500 depending on one's income, additional fuel tax, marijuana tax, more cigarette tax, and a statewide sales tax.

Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some…Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shuttered.  Our health care is too costly, our schools fail too many -- and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.

What the climatistas ought to be worried about is that it gets colder rather than warmer as it will bring the ice back.  Renewables are the shining example of crony capitalism, where democrats launder public dollars through high tech companies that go bankrupt and donate to democrat campaigns all in the name of oneness with Mother Gaia.  We are a cold part of the world and won't keep warm powering our homes with unicorn flatulence or breezes.  Want renewables?  Build the Watana dam.  Bring in some reactors - heat engines - small ones for the interior and medium ones for the railbelt.  The very best way to address climate change is to provide large quantities of inexpensive electricity to consumers.  Cheers -

Newt, Speaker of the House,, was having an affair while he was calling out President Clinton for the same thing.

I'd like to see the duplicity of school board administration costs reduced by amalgamation.

The fact is that cats are insanely independent creatures who may or may not learn what you want them to learn. It is absolutely true that many loving cat owners don't realize the little critter needs a scratching post until they've made one of the $4200 leather sofa in the living room.  If this anti-declawing campaign truly wants to save cats, they'll start spreading word far and wide on how to train cats not to scratch valuable stuff like that sofa & grandma with the thinning skin. Brochures at vets, shelters, discussion at the shelters with adopters, information on nail caps, etc. would do far more to minimize the chance a cat will be declawed than scolding LTE's & ordinances.

High school degrees were not required to work in well-paying manufacturing jobs.

If you want small single issue parties then we need a PR system of some kind to ensure they don't get crushed by our current electoral system.

There are some psychological ceilings to the current pricing for customers and I will keep it there as long as possible in order to maximize revenue and profit.  Your first sentence is, of course, not true. What is true is that the very rich have gotten much richer and the rest of the population has flat-lined. Some of the rich have gotten that way by paying their employees very poorly and expecting the taxpayers to fill in the rest.

What are we to make of Trump (a politician who is all performer) or of Bill Mahr or Ann Coulter (performers who are all entertainers)?

If there is a dispute, then the oil company has a right to a jury trial. This will take the conflict out of the current broken appeal system that lacks of due process and keeps oil and gas investors out of Alaska!  Next; Do away with all tax credits and taxes on all natural resources that pays royalty to the state and vote on a constitutional amendment not to change this for 30 years. This will cause the $60 Billion gas pipeline to be built and fill TAPS and kicks the hell out of this stupid rigged SB 21 system the majors used to keep Alaskans and smaller oil companies out of the oil & gas money. SB 21 is killing Alaska.  Create a self insured state. No bonds, red tape, costly and lengthy permitting process that keeps Alaskans broke and no Alaskans making profits in Alaska's oil business

Inflation right now is in the 2% area which is at the upper end of the BOC's target.  Poloz should not be threatening to lower interest rates, he should be talking about raising them.  Instead, he cowtows to the Liberal government and their voter base in Ontario and Quebec and the manufacturing industry there.  The manufacturers are so uncompetitive they need a $0.70 loonie to compete.  Poloz is making all of us poorer just to try to support the government and their voters.

Ice ages are artifacts of Milankovitch cycles - subtle variations in earth's tilt, distance from the sun, solar intensity, etc. that have well known periods of occurrence (though all of them are different so their combined effects don't show up like clockwork as you might expect).  Why do you refuse to acknowledge these facts:  -The earth has never warmed up this fast in at least the last 800,000 years.  -There is less than 1 chance in a million that global temps and CO2 concentrations are NOT causally linked.  -The earth's CO2 concentration is the highest it has ever been in 800,000 years (and quite possibly more) and during that time it has never spiked so high so quickly - not even close.  -Much smaller historic changes in CO2/temps have resulted in the earth going into and out of ice ages.

Trump is playing the crowd to heighten their fears of what Clinton is hinting at not seeking her death. He is pointing out the hypocrisy of  her seeking a national disarmament.   I also doubt if Clinton truly cares one way or the other on the subject. Her only goal is to attain the White House by any means necessary. Not to do good progressive deeds, but to accumulate wealth and power and set her child up to one day hold the office too.

He in no way then posited that this is the catholic position - rather, he called for dialogue. <<<  I'm not aware of this statement re: authentic acts of love, but your account is very consistent with my understanding & experience of Fr Martin's approach.  Furthermore, I agree that dissent can be fruitful, if responsible. If he does indeed dissent re: homoerotic expressions and LGBTQ relationships, he's most certainly doing so well within ecclesiastical guidelines (coy as he's been)?  Finally, this is first a question for evolutionary anthropology and the social & biological sciences before the moral philosophers get to wrangle with it. Moral theology jumped to conclusions long before the scientific evidence was in. W/o grasp of nature, natural law can't be formulated. W/o inductive personalist evidence, personal morality remains inapt & inept.

I think what we (especially journalists) should be asking Apple, is what progress has been made in eradicating the issue related to phone radiation and its link to multiple cancers, depending on what area of the body the phone is exposed to most. Absolutely no one is discussing this, especially the company that sells the most cell phones. Not sure I want to pay 1,000.00 for something that can due harm to the human body.  You will find the radiation warning deep in the iPhone's manual, buried where most people will not even bother to venture (due to legalize and apathy).  But this is a simmering issue that, obviously, the phone manufacturers would like to see kept low key. Perhaps Profit takes Precedence over People.

0,"I hope they're controlling for other factors, such as how many violent crimes are committed by illegals, how many are gang and drug related, what the socio-economic status of the high-crime areas is, and how many come from states where pot has been legalized. All of these factors (and others) affect the level of violent crimes, and are independent from being able to legally carry a gun. Yes, for years the increase in concealed carry issuance coincided with a decrease in violent crime, but responsible people always caution 'correlation does not imply causation' as there are numerous other factors to control for. There IS very good data from Texas where not only are they a 'shall issue' state, but businesses aren't allowed to have 'no weapons' policies. Based on the TBI data, concealed carry permit holders are 7x less likely to commit ANY crime than their non-permit holding counterparts. That is a better way to look at it - not just at the raw crime rate, but at the discrete populations.

0,"Cutting inane and out-dated rules is fine.  Doing so by an arbitrary regimen that requires two to be deleted for every new one added makes no sense at all.    I can see this forestalling the implementation of a new, needed rule because other needed rules would have to be cut.   I can see this causing some reasonable rules to be deleted, simply to make room for a new rule.  That appears to be the Trump way; rule by decree, half-baked ideas originating from linear thinking without regard to unintended consequence.  Foolish.

Although the old folks would deny it and we know the family history back to 1810 (on Mom's side), it wouldn't surprise me if there's some black because of the curly hair, but that could just as easily be from the Irish. DNA results wouldn't really change who I am. I was raised to respect all of the cultures that my parents brought to the table. Candy in our shoes for St. Lucia's Day, lots of foods from the European side of the family. Our bedtime stories were about the world on the turtle's back. Mom used to terrify me on Halloween with wendigo (not from Mom's tribe, actually). The fact still remains that we're all about 10 generations removed from each other ... at the most. DNA shouldn't change who we are because ultimately we are the sum total of who we were raised to be, not who slept with who centuries ago.

It didn't matter if we thought it was right or wrong for going into Iraq. Didn't matter. But once we were there we should have seen it through--by that ensuring we have a strong, U.S. friendly government in place there, and even then withdraw only very slowly, over decades if needed. But we seem incapable of seeing anything through for longer than the term of a president.

Let's assume that the States actually cares who is in our cabinet, which is a  big assumption. Of all the names recently announced and past appointees which name do you think is likely to grab the attention of the security departments in the States, because of their cabinet position. I'm not saying it's right, but rather just pointed out how the States operates. We all know how concerned they are about borders and illegal immigration.

Modern day language is rife with words whose etymology would be found offensive by someone if you dig deep enough. For example, people of Irish descent could easily take offence to the term 'paddy wagon'. But they don't, because like - most other ordinary people - they realize that any pejorative connotation attached to it has long since been washed from our vocabulary.  Anyone who questions whether political correctness has gone amok in this country will have absolute proof of it after reading this nonsense article. Some groups and cultures need to stop seeing boogey-men around every corner...and mainstream media need to stop giving every silly grievance a platform for airing them.

0,"This and other programs losing funding are largely responsible for a 50% decline in teen pregnancies over the course of 5 years. 50%.  According to the data we have, an unwanted pregnancy costs taxpayers an average of $1,682.00 annually from the date of birth to the age of 15. The national average for teen pregnancy is 9%.  Let's assume half of that number don't have babies because of this program:  9% of 1300 = 117 students 117 / 2 = 58.5 58 pregnancies prevented * 1682.00 dollars per year * 15 years = $1,463,340.  A net savings to taxpayers of $713,340 (it isn't 1 million, it's 750k that went to the program).  Now, imagine funding continues, more teachers are trained (who then pass on their learning) and an exponentially larger number of students are reached. How much money would we save? Hard to tell, but it isn't peanuts.

Horses, though more aloof than dogs, likewise can read humans pretty well, and are trusting unless abused.  I knew a man, Eritrean or Ethiopian, he wasn't clear about that. He lived in the highlands and was from a tribe of cattle herdsmen. His diet even in America was beef and milk. He told me that where he came from, every village had a lion. The lion knew everyone in the village and would threaten strangers. The lion would keep dogs and hyenas from the cattle. The villagers fed the lion, and the lion was smart enough to protect the cattle.  My house is surrounded by foxes, deer, bears, raccoons and coyotes who all exploit my garbage, the fruits of my orchard, the gophers in my lawn. The foxes recognize me, I see them at dusk. Humans are still connected to the wild, if only they would look and see it.

0,"Nat Turner, the leader of a violent Virginia slave uprising, will be honored on a new emancipation statue in Richmond Virginia Also honored will be Gabriel, often incorrectly referred to as Gabriel Prosser, who planned another slave rebellion in 1800 but was caught and executed before his planned rebellion began. It is difficult to overestimate the impact of Turner’s rebellion on the intensification of pro-slavery sentiment throughout the South and rising Southern resistance to the questioning of slavery in the North. Coming to the terms with the brutality of slave revolts brings the brutality and violence of slavery itself to the fore in a way America has seldom publicly faced.

0,"A well written letter; concise and much needed. The potential lethality of a firearm, though ownership a protected right, comes with responsibilities. The responsibilities include, but are not limited to knowing how to handle the firearm safely, being able to attain reasonable accuracy, and knowing under what circumstances a citizen is within his or her right and on the side of morality and personal ethics, in using lethal force. As to the question Steve Hunnicutt asks, """"Do you really need a gun?"""" I would answer that if you're considering only risks of attack, you're looking at only half the equation. You must consider the consequences of an attack and ask if you're willing to endure them. I think the answer then will justify preparing for the possibility of an attack. That doesn't necessarily mean that you should purchase a firearm. There are people, who are legally allowed to bear a firearm, who are just too clutsy to handle one. A baseball bat for them would be a better option.

By keeping the pre-existing conditions clause of the PPACA, but pricing almost every single older person that currently qualifies for a subsidy completely out of the market, you destroy the very viability of the Alaska individual insurance market. That will then leave the currently unsubsidized people high and dry without a insurance provider. Regarding raising the maximum age based premium multiplier from 3 to 5. Again, this will price older people out of the market. Healthy older people worry about going without insurance, and they will buy it if they possibly can. The Young Invincibles won't spend any money on insurance unless they have to, because (with broad brushstrokes)  they don't envision getting sick or having an accident. They also have fewer assets to worry about. The 5 times multiplier won't get them to buy insurance.

The only problem with that is that Oregon's income tax is one of the highest and most regressive in the country - because it tops out for rate at a very low level of income.  Measure 5 also had the effect of leveling school funding between districts across the state - curing serious inequities between neighboring districts right here in Lane County and throughout the state.  Measure 97 is the largest tax increase in Oregon history.  It will increase state revenues by 30%.  No one knows for sure where it will really go - but based on past performance - we cannot trust that it will go to help K-12 class size.  School districts will just put it into PERS and upping the salaries of current employees - just like they have been doing for years.  And Measure 97 would not just tax big corporations, but would increase prices - all over the state economy.

I've heard several of them, on air, basically telling listeners to give because it's what  the Lord wants them to do, and that giving their money to Catholic media is a """"good investment"""" for their hopes of salvation.

0,"In desperation, Bombardier just gave to Airbus, 50.01% of their C Series aircraft, and oh, by the way, 50.01% of the money we as taxpayers gave to Bombardier. Did you notice the fine print? """"No cash is changing hands in the deal and the C Series partnership assumes no debt as part of the transaction..."""" In other words Airbus just got a huge gift for standing in the right place at the right time. It looks clever, but it means that Bombardier, if it ever can, must repay us out of its approximate 31% stake of the holdings, instead of the previous 81%. On the other hand, that may be a better outlook than Bombardier going bankrupt after the Junior Prime Minister decided to go to war with Boeing rather than salvage the deal through negotiations. His inexperience, once again, has cost Canada dearly. Airbus has outsmarted their Quebec cousins and will get the cream off of this deal for a very meagre investment as compared to what Canadians have paid. Onward and upward!

And so far he hasn't shown any actual conflict of interest with the groups involved. But he certainly had the opportunity, and since he has placed so much emphasis on his party remaining above suspicion this revelation stinks of hypocrisy. But until someone can actually show me a real conflict of interest, and not just the opportunity for one, I won't be jumping on the conservative bandwagon just yet.  Smarten up Trudeau.

0,"To tell you the truth Bill, I don't think there is any excuse for a man forcing himself on a woman that isn't willing.  Same goes for a powerful woman forcing herself on a man.  Period.  I'm just saying that women are more sexually adventuresome than 'society' is ready to accept publicly,(especially those over 50).   Birth control has lessened concern for pregnancy, and woman seek social power in ways that weren't common 50 years ago.  So why Wouldn't they use sex to achieve power/status?     There's a female Weinstein out there.  Moving toward gender equality has not been easy.  It's important that people be truthful with each other.   It's important people feel 'safe' if you want the truth.  Fewer threats and accusations would help men and women feel safer to talk honestly.

0,"Hmm. So that property is at the deepest part of the proposed reservoir?  Build the dam on property you already own. They'll move! {/sarcasm}  I agree that eminent domain is a needed, and powerful, tool for the construction of PUBLIC projects.  It prevents one owner from blocking a project.  I'm not sure about the ability to use this tool outside Aurora's jurisdiction. Perhaps they should have Park County acquire the land, and the purchase it from them. Park county is probably in favor of the project, based on the construction employment & tax revenue. BTW: What are the property taxes on a reservoir?  Who pays them?  That being said, I do NOT believe that Eminent Domain should be used to transfer title from one private entity to another private entity, a trailer park to a shopping center developer for example, regardless of the improved public good.

And they shall say to the elders of his city, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey us, he is a glutton and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death; so you shall remove the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear of it and fear.""""""""

0,"Everywhere are terrorist acts where religion is used to justify an escalating level of carnage. These terrorists all have Holy books that state that, if killing to be done, their version of God will do it. Mortals are expressly forbidden to kill one another. Yet the killing continues. The reasons never make sense. The objectives are never clear. Goals never seem to be met. Islam now gets blamed yet we have had centuries of other religions doing the same. Only the technology used and scale of the carnage seem to have changed over the years.  The media must take a more positive role. The scale of these acts and their global reach relies on media coverage. When one act is reported it seems to motivate other acts. What if the media stops trolling the world for religious intolerance and spends its efforts looking for people of religion getting along? The media may not solve the problem but at least it can stop profiting from it..  Do we really """"need to know"""" this - I know I don't!

We need to be critical thinking, free thinking, responsible citizens so we learn from history and develop better politics, a better economic system and an ethical code that works for all.

If we merely say, """"Canada is amazing, our history is awesome, we're the best"""", we turn a blind eye to many things done wrong in our past. One example of what we should be ashamed of is Canada's attitude towards Jews in the 1930's and 40's. Anti-Semitism was rampant. Like the rest of the world, Canada was quite fascistic, in it's mistreatment of Jews, French-Canadians, First Nations, Chinese, gays, etc. The anti-Semitism of many nations was part of what encouraged the Nazis to come to power and perpetrate the Holocaust. Recall what Prime Minister King said in 1938, refusing a shipload of Jews from Germany: """"One is too many.""""

When companies start loosing money through bad decisions---like---failing to lay people off in the name of social justice, paying too much, etc-the value of stocks will plummet and people like you and me will drop their stocks leading the company into potential insolvency.

In October of that year, he was given a 1-Y medical deferment,[24] which was attributed to heel spurs.[25] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which gave him a low probabilty to be called to military service.

The two COBI water utilities had the highest water rates in Western Washington ... it took a citizen lawsuit to get the City Manager/City staff to cut the employees they were charging into the utility by more than half.

The computers that were hacked were: Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server and the DNC's networks-  not US government networks.  It is not the President's job to use the brute force of foreign policy, sanctions, and kicking out diplomats to protect non-US government resources.  These resources were (a)unauthorized, (b)not government secured, and (c)nothing to do with US Government business.  The proper avenue would be for Clinton (her server was private after all) and the DNC to go to the FBI and have them investigate like any other citizen would - not have the President call in the CIA personally and use foreign policy to exact revenge for his DNC friends.  The media should be grabbing on this side of the narrative.  McCain is known anti-Russian war hawk, and the DNC and eviscerated Clinton and Obama are using the Govt resources for their own objectives.

0,"I have to disagree for the reasons already mentioned. You seem complacent in the D failing to do it's job, blaming it on the O but yet you don't recognize that the losses are a TEAM problem. In the simplest terms, the O's job is to score and the D's job is to prevent scores. ANY failure of EITHER unit is a failure - and it's not a matter of degrees as you want to imply. Heck, if the O scores 3 then it's on the D to allow zero and conversely, if the D holds to 0 then it's on the O to score at least 3. The 1985 Bears had 4 shutouts and 10 more games of giving up 10 points or less. The 2000 Ravens had 4 shoutouts and 11 more games holding teams to 10 pts or less. The Broncos D hasn't shut a team out since 2005. Now I'm not saying the Ravens or Bears seasons were the norm, they weren't but the Broncos D is supposed to be """"elite"""" - at least that's what they're paid like, so ya, if they're gonna get all the praise for wins, let them carry some of the blame for losses.

That perspective sees no discontinuity at any point in evolution, and most certainly does not entertain our specific religious problem of ensoulment, a necessary and irreducible discontinuity from our perspective.  In imagining, in speculating, about a solution, I accept direct creation by Yahweh in the sense of ensoulment as inescapable, but see no reason to imagine the direct creation of the bodies of our earliest ancestors (which you seem to see as required?). Indeed, Yahweh directly creates everyone of us in the womb by a similar act of direct creation, of ensoulment of sexually reproduced biological matter. I suggest that once one ponders the equivalence of that first ensoulment and all subsequent ensoulments, each an instance of direct creation, then the starting point disappears as a problem. ...2

It's going to be hard for the Trumpbots to maintain their delusions about him for however long he's in office. But, it will be absolutely necessary for them to do so, so as to try and avoid the inevitable guilt they will feel when--if--they finally see the damage they've done.

Then there are ordinary political people who often describe themselves as conservatives that take the questionable science from these companies and pretend it is believable. By the way each time the planet has gone into warming usually from the explosion of a super volcano, an ice age followed.  Man himself did not cause the previous warning but the one we are undergoing now is from the unwise continued use of fossil fuels that the greedy petroleum industry continues to promote.  It is very interesting that there was a hostile share holder proposition passed during the last Mobile oil meeting forcing Moble to make yearly progress away from fossil fuel and asking them to finance more authentic research by Universities not controlled by the Mobile dollar.  So even the stock holders have taken notice. Why not you Dan?

0,"You're correct about education in the long term. But for the recent past SA's had a skills mismatch, which is NOT a skill shortage. Ie, too many or too few skills than the economy needs at a point in time. Engineering, the core discipline for economic infrastructure, is losing lost jobs due to retrenchments, lack of investment, political interference in the government sector, etc. (A recent chem eng graduate we know could only find work as a debtor's clerk!) Similarly for accountants. Another reason skilled people struggle to find work is employers don't want to pay thinking semi and unqualified people can do the work, often to disastrous results. This is not only in government and state enterprises.  Very high unemployment, and increasing graduate unemployment - still low compared to the total - indicates serious, fundamental structural econ problems going back 20 years - it's NOT a recent phenomenon - due to the reasons I mentioned. It will take another 20 years to fix

0,"There is no obligation to keep the reasons for a settlement confidential.   That is often a term of the settlement, but it does not have to be.  While there was most likely  legal liability here, I question the sum paid.  It may be appropriate but it seems high to me considering that  quadriplegia caused by negligence commands about $ 2 million for pain and suffering but excluding lost income and costs of future care.  In these circumstances, the settlement should have included the express right to make public the rationale for the settlement.  We taxpayers have a right to know if the sum was reasonable.  If a term of the settlement included confidentiality, I suggest that was a poorly  thought out concession on the part of the federal government, And while lawyers take the lead in negotiating, they take instructions from the client.  The client decides.  That client was ultimately the PM.

0,"After three years  all that has come from both Pope Francis and the O'Malley Commission is talk and more talk. In point of fact that's all that has come from the Vatican since these horrific crimes have been reported. There's not even a process by which to investigate and, if necessary, punish Bishops who are not dealing with sexual abuse/assaults in their dioceses, to say nothing about a missing process for dealing with Bishops who are accused of being sexual predators themselves.  I believe Marie Collins that there is not a true commitment by the Vatican, including those """"don't use my name"""" Vatican sources, to deal with reported sexual abuse. The lack of progress by the Commission and unwillingness of some Vatican offices to even write a simple letter of acknowledgement to sexual abuse victims speaks volumes. It is crystal clear that protecting their own is far more important than holding accountable and punishing those men who abuse/assault/rape children. It is unconscionable.

Mexico has always had a higher abortion rate than the U.S. even though up until very recently abortion was illegal in Mexico.  How does one know that statistic?  One knows it, in part,  by the amount of women in Mexico who died getting illegal abortions.  Fact is that in no country where abortion has been made illegal is there proof that abortion has declined & most of these countries have instead the highest abortion rates.  Criminalizing abortion makes a abortion a crime it does not end it or even lessen its presence.

0,"Let's approach this question from the perspective of hermeneutics. Does the truth of the Gospel exist in what actually happened during the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus? If so, we are immersed in an historical-critical project from which we may never emerge, but in that view it would be difficult to argue that the historical Jesus showed anything like a preferential option for the poor. Thus the second question: does the truth of the Gospel exist in the stories told by the four canonical evangelists, which have been considered revelation almost since the very beginning? If so, those who get to tell the story also get to shape it. History shows they have often shaped it to fit their contours. Finally, does the truth of the Gospel exist in a dialectic between Gospel and those who hear it, so that one informs and reshapes the other? If so, then Liberation Theology, though not perfect in its methods, has a better chance of leading us to truth than the historical church.

0,"This comment pertains to the latest from Vancouver City Hall, the so-called """"Vancouver Empty Homes Tax"""".  Vancouver, hitherto a world class city, is fast fading: """"While Castro had a revolution,  Gregor Robertson is presiding over a devolution"""". Many owners, including actors, writers, musicians, producers, etc. have legitimate reasons to be non-resident owners of properties in Vancouver. The 6 month rule will force most to rent full time or sell, given the proposed 500% increase in taxes on them. The day this measure became public, 140 luxury condos (now up to over 500) were posted for rent on Craig's List, IN THE FALSE CREEK AREA ALONE. With no takers.  The stark reality is that there is NO RENTAL MARKET for luxury condos. This type of draconian action will not ameliorate the homeless situation, only exacerbate it, as money and spending will flow out of  Vancouver to friendlier shores. Watch the old adage """"Be careful what you wish for."""" become manifest overnight.  It's Economics 101

0,"Your statement assumes that only Measure 11 crimes define viloent offenders. That certainly reveals a total lack of understanding of the criminal justice system. There are many people in the hospital on other than Measure 11 crimes that are in fact very dangerous. In addition, there are many at the hospital that were civilly committed that are equally dangerous, even though they did not get to the hospital through the criminal justice system. That said, there are indeed a substantial number of people in the hospital (my estimate is somewhere around 40%) both on the the forensic side and the civil side, who really are not that dangerous and who could be treated in a less restrictive environment if such facilities existed. They don't. Communities have fought tooth and nail to keep these facilities out, and have been successful.

If I recall correctly, a high speed train between Toronto and Montreal, for example , would require almost 400 new bridges.  The costs would be staggering - well into the multi billion dollar range.  To be feasible, there needs to be a very large number of  trips  taken on the railway and this requires a travelling population far in excess of  population or rail trip densities in Canada.

Apart from the current crop of practitioners, some of whom must be actively planning to accept appointments south of the border,  there is the problem that those entering the medical profession must be thinking twice about doing that in Canada. The Liberals' tax plans will have the effect of creating an even worse shortage of general practitioners and specialists, and as each one leave Canada, one less taxpayer at 53% is lost to the federal and provincial  governments' combined income tax revenue.

0,"As a number of other commenters have observed, what data? The only hard data I saw in this article suggests the opposite. As an experienced business person myself I know personally a great many female entrepreneurs, and with those people you are absolutely correct in the degree of drive and spirt of adventure they possess. The idea of sexist barriers didn't occurr to them. People make choices, and however politically incorrect, for whatever reason, men and women...on average...have different personalities. Does this affect the balance of women entrepreneurs? It's something I'd be looking at. But anyway, why is it a matter of societal concern that we don't have enough women entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs of any sort? Women are severely underrepresented in the trades, and I think society - and the houses we live in - would be a whole lot better built were that not the case. Ah....but wait, I forgot, men and women are perfectly equal. Guess we need programs & quotas there too.

0,"The left has never understood postmodernism in any rigorous sense. Derrida and Foucault were derivatives of Nazi Heidegger, simply adding a grab-bag of formulaic deconstruction tactics. This philosophical ethical vacuum suited the Totalitarian moral agenda of the left, who smugly and nihilistically deconstruct traditional discourse and ideology, only to usher in its own through the back door. Social justice warriors are the demon spawn of this ploy, which is ironic as they have no coherent theory of justice.  Postmodernism is an epistemological critique based on math and science (nonlinear dynamics). Nietzsche checked out from the Basel University library over 30 times Cantor's work on set theory (with the diagonalzation proof that the infinity of real numbers exceeds the infinity of rational numbers). Derrida-Foucault minions don't understood Cantor, much less Godel, Turing, Davidson and nonlinear dynamics. So they miss entirely the constructive aspect of postmodernism.

Most people have been around many blacks at some point in their life, so 2 be intimidated solely because someone is black is not believable in a society where blacks r common. I'm wondering about Carolyn's demeanor & voice. Does she have a deep, throaty, gruff & aggressive voice? Does she have a quick temper? Was she using language? Just because she was referred 2 as """"black"""" by her coworkers doesn't mean skin color is why she was fired. And so what if someone expressed surprise she was married 2 a white man.

But the thing is, whichever does win, the interests of those businessmen don’t change. So they’ll push for the same policies in either case.  And that’s the reason why you end up with there being very little difference between Conservative and Liberal policies.  Ask yourself this – what of great significance has changed in Canada since the Liberals took power?  Not much that I see.  It’s more or less a continuation of the previous government.  Maybe a few policies on the periphery, but the core is identical.  Meet the new boss.  Same as the old boss (but with nicer hair).

""""Show me how good you're doing before I'll fix your leaky roof"""" simply doesn't make sense to me.

This year the bond issue is leaner and is funding necessities...failing roofs and HVAC systems. I didn't vote for last year's bond package, but I will this year, knowing it's on top of my property taxes and my kid's private school tuition. Although they likely bought the cameras with our property taxes rather than the bond money anyway.

0,"An early reference to the Blessed Sacrament is found in the life St Basil (4th century) who divided the Eucharistic bread into three parts. One part he consumed, the second part he gave to the monks, and the third he placed in a golden dove-shaped container suspended over the altar.  The specific liturgies began as a response to Eucharist heresies, beginning with Berengarius of Tours (d. 1088 AD) who adopted the view of John Scotus Erigena (9th century) that the view that the sacraments of the altar are figures of the body of Christ, a memorial of the true body and blood of Christ, which are not truly and really present.  Following Berengarius, a series of Eucharistic heresies right through the Protestant Revolt led the Church to emphasize the Real Presence, particularly with adoration.  These sorts of controversies did not occur in the East, which do not share the Western tradition of  Eucharistic adoration.

Those of us who were not as fortunate, were paid a paltry sum of money, in the 60's R10,00 a week.  We were fed lies and falsehoods about the """"Swart Gevaar"""" and communists, who would slaughter all whites. The murders which happened in the Belgium Congo and other African states were held before us and we were certain that this would certainly be our fate as well.

0,"Biblical prophecy certainly is interesting in connection with what we are seeing. Much of it is incomprehensible to me, but the parts about the earth are easy to understand and are scary right-on.  Some of the best is actually from the old testament, and I quoted some of it recently. Hosea says that there will be mass die-offs, including beasts of the field, the birds in the sky, and even the fishes of the sea will die. Daniel has a fascinating prophecy that says that knowledge will increase, and the people will be highly mobile. Certainly that is the case of our era, something that began not that long ago and is in stark contrast to the rest of human history. The trees will burn, the oceans will die, and people will be terrified of the storms. There will be stark increases in earthquakes and war.  I came to my conclusions through science that the earth has been dealt a fatal blow, but when I read biblical prophecy I thought my hair would catch fire, it was so uncanny.

0,"Hillary lost for much the same reason why Obama won: Americans are looking for actual change.  Americans, in large numbers, feel that the current political system is failing them and that both parties are equally responsible.  And really, can you blame them?  American's national debt is spiralling out of control.  Median wages in the country have stagnated ever since the 'dot.com' bubble burst in 1999 while median wages in many other countries, including Canada, have risen steadily for 2 decades now.  Politicians largely seem increasingly out of touch with what is happening on the ground.  The result?  Obama came in campaigning on 'Real Change' and won some of the most lopsided elections in decades, though whether he delivered is questionable at best.  Sanders and Trump came in promising actual change while Hillary Clinton came in promising the status quo, and people voted for change.  Whether Trump will deliver change, and what that change will look like, is still up in the air.

So we built in a safeguard against bad faith actors, hostile to fundamental Democratic positions.  A SMALL group of Democrats organized to block acceptance of Beth's membership. Beth decided patience is a virtue and took extra time to win over as many Democratic networks as she could. The opposition collapsed.  To its credit, the OCC resisted the temptation to indulge in drama and rendered a decision consistent with the intent of the Rules. There was nothing """"predetermined"""" about the decision.

0,"Certainly, your take on the course of events here is entirely yours.  However, there's a backstory. During the campaign and going back to the initial announcement of his candidacy, Mr. Trump made a point of singling out immigrants and immigration as a principle focus of his campaign and his statements expressed that he'd pursue deportation as a remedy. While vague on specifics on how that would be accomplished, Mr. Ramos sought to press him for further explanation and clarity in a manner that I would term aggressive, get-out-the-story reporting but you see as heckling.  Being a private citizen in the public eye, Mr. Trump has basked in positive media attention [some of his own creation, such as the mock-up Time Magazine covers]  but recoils when that attention becomes probing or critical. As POTUS, he's got to accept that level of scrutiny and  demonstrate leadership  instead of participating in a tit-for-tat social media distraction.

The hot water that comes up from underground that is used is some pretty nasty stuff that produces alot of waste that is very similar to oil and gas waste.  Lots of salt water brine with some nasty stuff in it.  That being said it can still be a viable energy source under the right conditions.

Trudeau's trip came out in bits and pieces, after the PMO initially stonewalled. No one cares where the interim leader goes, but she did contact the Ethics Commissioner. The logic here is if you are going to attack the PM, then first make sure you are not guilty of the same thing. Since the rules are not about the yacht , but how you got there, then you are fine. Most specifically the rules apply to the PM, which is why Seamus O'Reagan is not under investigation. The Liberals have a bad week again, and would love to change the channel.

Anchorage already has both of those needs in place. Does it make sense to abandon existing and build new when the university is already cutting programs due to budget cuts.  I can remember when all graduate programs for teachers were all  in Fairbanks.  UAA faculty could not offer graduate courses for teachers so UAF staff came to Anchorage.

With the world's population growing at an alarming rate this planet will have a hard time sustaining the nearly 15 billion people we expect to feed, educate and support in just a few decades. Not to mention the affects on our environment and resources. The UN predicts it will level off at that point although it is not clear to me what conditions will trigger that.  At 7 billion we have long exceeded the ideal population of 4 billion.  Politicians and business people like the idea of population growth. It increases the number of consumers and therefore artificially helps to grow the economy in the long term.

Yes, they have been convicted, and no, I do not believe society in general is neutral on this sort of behaviour, but, had this been a Muslim sect, it would be spread far and wide as proof positive of Islams fundamental correlation with misogyny and backwardness. All religions have dark sides, and outliers, that do not represent the mainstream.  It does an injustice to sound reasoning to not attempt to reduce hysteria as a result of false narratives. Do not take this to mean Islam deserves a free pass, it does not, but nor does it deserve special vilification, or scare-mongering.  Doing so serves no good purpose, beyond ignorance, and civil discord.

0,"It's well established that in most health measures, African Americans have worse outcomes than whites. Study after study has shown that blacks are more likely to be diagnosed with health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma and are also more likely to die from cancer, stroke and heart disease. The disparities have been largely attributed to socioeconomic differences and unequal access to quality health care. Now a study (2016) published this month in the American Heart Association journal Circulation suggests that if all patients get the same care, these health differences disappear, and in fact, African Americans fare better than whites.   In order to keep a job, black workers also must meet a higher bar. Only in instances where black workers are monitored and displayed a significantly higher skill level than their white counterparts would they stand a significant chance of keeping their jobs for a while, the researchers found.

Jesus also spoke in pretty strong & unequivocal terms. Since without the support of  their children, the parents would have most likely perished.

English Canada. That's the Harperite contribution to Unity. The head of the Peladeau-ex-SunNews is now the ex-Tory named Brian Mulroney.

0,"Yes - Keep abortion legal and support services to women and families like public daycare,  work training, college education support for both mothers and fathers, free healthcare so pregnancy is far more manageable, even when it is unexpected.  These services could be offered to all people in our country, and in Europe many or all of them are offered.  It does not sound like Poland offers them.  I keep telling folks, on these kind of article's comments, that countries that illegalize abortion have higher rates of abortion per pregnancies but no one seems interested in facts on these threads.  Legal abortion does not cause abortion.  throwing tiny amounts of money at women won't cure abortion either but real solutions, especially the kind that cost taxes to fund, might lessen abortion a great deal.  That along with teaching that indeed there is a life of a person growing in the womb and that it is not the same thing as an empty womb.    If we won't pay, we prove we don't really care.

0,"240 lbs for a 5 ft 4 in person is still a very high body mass index of 41.2.   According to the National Institute of Health, that is quite obese.  A BMI of over 30 is defined to be Obese.   She would have to get down to 174 lbs to no longer be considered obese, and become classified as being badly overweight.  At 340 lbs, she was at risk of suffering very early disability and even death.  She has indeed made great improvement.  But this amount of progress will only delay her getting heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and all of the other serious maladies associated with obesity.   She might be able to get through her 40's in relatively good heath, but by the time she reaches her 50's, it will catch up with her.  She really needs to get down to at the very least 160 lbs, if she wants to have any quality of life when she is older.   Let's hope that this trip allows her to do just that.

The SoCreds used money collected from Public Service Workers as a slush fund to build gigaprojects such as the WAC Bennett Dam, paying 2% less interest than Vancouver was paying for sewer and drain bonds at the time.

The right question is: if we need guns to defend ourselves against tyrants - why didn't the Nazi gun bans prevent the Warsaw uprising (or the thousands of other armed resistances throughout their empire) ? Well, simple, because gun control are for normal situations - nobody OBEYS a gun law by a government that wants to kill you. If the need arises to resist a true tyrant - all the people advocating for gun control right now would acquire guns, join the resistance and fight back right next to you. But that is, of course, a situation that has declined rather a lot in frequency - out of over 300 countries on earth, such situations only arise an average of once every 3 decades, and sufficiently so to create resistance movements only once or twice a century. Why sacrifice millions of innocent people every year, to protect against a one in a million scenario you probably won't live to experience, when you don't even NEED to sacrifice them to have the gun if it happens ?

Moreover unless you know who Melancthon was, and the other players, you don't have the full picture.

Also, in touring Germany it is also necessary to realize how a Calvinist monarchy of the state that came to dominate the country (Prussia) and birth the Second Reich (the first being the so-called H.R.Empire) impacted Lutheranism.

This president's only accomplishments to date have been the total defiling of the office of president, a lowering of the state of public discourse to the level of pro wrestling, and turning our government into a nepotistic family for-profit enterprise. All of the bigoted and sociopathic promises he made and you cheered have not, and will not, come to pass. In fact nothing will get done, including attention to very serious matters, given the president spends his days obsessed with repairing his fragile, massive ego. But as long as """"liberals"""" are upset, that's all that matters, even if the whole country goes down for it.

0,"Good article. I think that politicians should be removed from decision making when it comes to natural resource management. Period. But this never happens - they just can help meddling in things (and I worked for 30 years for a provincial government natural resource ministry, so I do know about politics and meddling). That is why we have organizations like the NEB - to do a fair, balanced review of projects and either approve or reject them. We don't need politicians to come in later to test the political winds and then decide again - it is plainly not fair to the proponents or to Canadians. It is like politicians making the final decision of guilt after a court trial.  I hope that the cabinet is taken out of the decision making and the NEB has the final say as was recently recommended by the senate committee. Make it a very rigorous, thorough process, but keep the politicians out of it (we can always dream, can't we?).

0,"I'm no fan of Cardinal Law, nor am I a fan of the custom of giving disgraced bishops meaningless ceremonial roles to help them save face. But, unlike his predecessors, Pope Francis doesn't seem inclined to do that, as demonstrated by the way he dealt with both Archbishop Nienstedt and Bishop Finn, neither of whom have any official position in the Church at the present.  That said, the persistent story that the Vatican is shielding Law from prosecution in the U.S. is completely false. Jurisdictions in Massachusetts can file charges against Law any time they like but have never done so. He is free to come and go in this country as he pleases.

Despite regular requests, Matthew Rainwater has refused to narrow the scope of his public records request.  Even though I have indicated to him that his request as it stands will take three years to fulfill, he has made it clear he expects me to fulfill it before I leave office.

0,"Deadly force is quite restricted in preventing an escape, through AS. More importantly, is the use of force a good idea in a given circumstance.  The reasons alluded to by police were defense under the threat of serious harm.  I agree police have refused, even three days later, to release any information about their actions, so we don't know what happened.  However, these officers are acting in the public's name and therefor we (the public) are responsible to judge them (in the sense of ensuring there actions are proper). It is the responsibility of the state (troopers in this case) to make the necessary information available to the public to ensure actions are proper, maintaining public trust.  This case could be a clear cut case of self defense, or it could be a case of a cop blasting away because he was pissed off the guy was going to get away.  We will probably never know, with the police refusing to release any info.  I know nothing of Mr. Tupper other than what is in the article.

At one point they estimated a skills course at Lord Hill Park could attract 500,000 bikers annually, but that figure has since been adjusted down to 200,000. 2) Yes, there are several such trails in Lord Hill Park now. What the Parks Department is considering is a large section--the original proposal  was 400 acres--dedicated to a bike skills course, in addition to independent trails. 3) We are not at all against mountain biking in the right setting. Lord Hill Park is acceptable for mountain biking to the extent and in the locations already established for bikes. Other suitable locations nearby include Centennial Trail, Paradise Valley (where the State DNR has set aside a large piece of land and $1 million for development of a mountain bike course) and on North Mountain in Darrington.

Not many people decide to spend a week or two on vacation in Syria, Mexico attracts they by the plane load.  I suggest countries need to pick their battles.  Running to Trump in an attempt to have him adjust his view on Mexico or for that matter anything he feels strongly about would be as successful as the GOP's attempt to repeal and replace Obama Care.  The opportunity may arise where Canada can add support which will be meaningful.  That occasion has yet to arise.

The level of anger that some activists show, and the guilt and personal blame that they seem to want to dish out to white people is often off putting and counter productive. Nobody chooses their parents or their race.  But realizing being of a certain race does in a general sense confer some privilege shouldn't be a radical thought.

Forgotten in all of this is the visual and suggestive titulation and sexual stimulation of men by female dress and behaviour. Humans are primates and the sexual drive is the dominant hormonal behaviour catalyst.  If either sex dresses or behaves in a sexually provocative and stimulating manner, what other response would anyone expect.  This is not to excuse sexually aggressive behaviour just that containing a strong hormonal drive is not always probable.  Maybe the Chandra is a very good idea

0,"Shannyn Moore what if  they change the laws so for the first time in history, Alaskans can drill and produce oil and gas at a profit?  No one bid in the last DNR Beaufort Sea sales because the state increase rental cost by 1,000%  up to 8,000% to keep Alaskans and smaller competitors out of the lease sales!  They seem to want the majors to own and control it all in Alaska, but it hurts the people and competitors!  Many feel the Governor should get rid of all the harsh oil and gas actions and rules they use to rig the game to keep small competitors out of the oil business!  If they fix it many  feel the state can keep the incentives and credits!  How about a straight 20% royalty with no tax confusion or tricks!  Then the state can make the oil and gas rules work for all to produce more oil safely and fairly.  Can the state stop the big oil Monopoly and the few bad apples at the state's oil & gas agency who are running interference to keep small competitors out of the oil market!

If I had my druthers, I would make the old downtown LCC building the new downtown shelter, and then make living on the street corners and flying signs under bridges illegal. It is just unhealthy for the city, and for those who live rough, to live in large groups in the freezing weather, holding signs and existing on handouts. Of course, I would have a state lottery with the profits dedicated to building and staffing homeless shelters, so no tax money is needed. No shelter, no arrest.

Perhaps  pressure on companies to withdraw their advertising from the Rebel site had something to do with that.  There is also the chance that the CPC/Rebel alliance has lost its appeal and that  the damage another appearance by Andrew Scheer would do with voters at large would outweigh the boost to the large contingent of supporters shared by the CPC /Rebel.

Clinton in 1994 threatened preemptive strikes against NK. Obama, who watched fecklessly as NK built their nuclear and ICBM arsenal, threatened direct military action. Clinton gave NK carte blanche to build their nuclear weapons. Obama used """"strategic patience"""" which is a euphemism for """"doing nothing"""" effective.

When a good case comes along it should be pursued by the district attorney's office and if there is a conviction the sentence should be widely publicized. It should serve as a deterrent to those who might be tempted to break the law. A very good case might be the one against the Governor's friend, Roland Maw from Kenai, who was indicted on 12 felony counts of perjury stemming from several years of PFD fraud. But the problem is that he had not yet been brought to trial. After almost a year since charges were first brought. Why is that?  Is the prosecution being told to hold off? Does the fact that Maw contributed and held fundraising events for the Governor in Kenai have anything to do with this lack of prosecution? While applying for a PFD, Maw was receiving non resident hunting and fishing privileges in Montana. For which he was prosecuted and found guilty, by the way. So how is it that he can scare away  from Alaska charges?

Our moral law must be more humanistic, telling the faithful how to live the happiest of human lives - which does not necessarily imply license.  The biblical justification is that Jesus is meek and humble of heart, his yoke is easy and his burden light.

We suffered from the wars of religion in Europe, and wanted no repeat here.

0,"This editorial reeks of pure ignorance of history and context.  Cuba was one of the most unequal societies in the Americas when Castro came to power. It was a criminal regime, being fleeced by other criminals, often to the advantage of American gangsters. During Castro's time in power, particularly during the 1960s to 1990s, Cuba was a far better place to live than almost anywhere else in Central America. Places like El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala were in the middle of vicious civll wars and genocides, driven by American-backed forces. 80,000 people were killed in ES; 80,000 in two wars in Nicaragua; in Guatemala, a genocide against the native population killed more than 200,000. Castro was certainly a dictator and he certainly did things wrong; but he cannot compare to the far worse monsters around him. Fighting the Cold War decades after it is over -and during the failure of capitalism - is ludicrous. I suggest that the Globe editorial writers think more before they write.

For example, a young lady was illegally arrested for practicing Falun Dafa. They brought her to a hospital and asked her to sign a document giving the state the right to harvest her organs. She knew they meant while she was still alive. She refused so they beat her, knocked out a few teeth, then cut off her fingers. Unthinkable cruelty, that is never mentioned by Western media nor the U.N. because of corporate greed.

0,"empty homes are not a problem.  They are a choice.  I cannot figure out why so many free thinking people can think for one second that someone who owns a home, should not be able to choose to live in it, rent it out, or leave it vacant.  What happened to freedom? to determine a solution to the social problem of homelessness on people who happen to want to leave their homes vacant is ridiculous. Before the Chinese were coming to buy houses in Vancouver, there was a homeless problem.  Why then, blame homeowners who want to leave their house vacant.  There are rules in place to deal with properties that are unkempt, but government reach to find new and creative ways to tax people has become the real problem>  I understand many will disagree, mainly because people who take from the government want to ensure the government takes more from paying citizens.

It still warmed throughout this entire period - the rate at which warming increased was somewhat lower than older models had predicted.

We were told the cameras work well and tickets are issued and that it frees up law enforcement for more important issues.

That's ridiculous because some nights drivers do ok, some nights they end up in the hole. And sometimes they just break even.  After working 12hrs trying to catch calls? Yeah, no.  We need uber, lyft and more permits here to reduce this mess to something that others can actually make a profit doing and not just a profit to the permit holders.

0,"Yes, there are government programs that benefit us. You probably get government services I don't, even though I pay considerable taxes.   People who have children pay more on main street and invest into our society more than people who don't.  A tax credit for these children means the money stays in the local community to be spent.  It benefits the community. People who have children care  about the community and that makes the world a better place.  While the likes of you advocate for anarchy and abject poverty and a complete break down of society that depends on families.  What is also interesting is how you Trolls oppose abortion, but do not support health care during pregnancy or after the child is born.  You oppose access to birth control and family planning,  and then complain when they are born and oppose support.  We already have an astounding child poverty rate and child hunger, but the callous, corrosive alt right are just fine this. Do you call yourself Christian too?

So, some have to suffer more than others to maintain some level of stability.  I'm in no way advocating that, but it is what it is.  Loosen the reigns, and that region falls to pieces, as we witness in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  I'm watching our culture start to fragment and become more and more violent or aggressive.

In any case, parents aren't opposed to school choice where it can work, we just wanted someone with experience and would commit to accountability based on lessons learned with charters and vouchers. Many of the Senators felt it was unions calling and writing and weren't listening but it was just mama and papa bears, like me which is unfortunate.

0,"The simple fact is that a substantial increase in the capital tax rate will wipe out the startup industry in Canada. The simple reasoning is that money will find a home where the risk / reward is most attractive. At the moment we see reasonable investment into innovation in Canada because the high failure rate of startups is offset by the favourable taxation on the few companies that do well. Change that equation and it will make more sense to put the same money to work in another country or in safer investments in Canada.

Inspiration says that his real difficulty was that he loved to have the pre-eminence among them. This was the spirit of self-exalting independence and disregard of gospel order and organization which led straight on to the papacy.""""

Among these might be found atheists. On the other hand, there were others who protested their condemnation: """"We taught in your streets, we worked miracles in your name"""".

It is not they who say, 'Lord, Lord' that enter the Kingdom of Heaven but they who do the will of the Father."""" While salvation is of grace, grace may be given to whomever God pleases to give it.

If criminal contempt of court is such a """"nothing burger"""" why did he seek and accept a pardon from Trump?  Our legal system depends on compliance with court orders ranging from search warrants to injunctions, particularly for law enforcement officials. Arpaio put himself above the law while claiming to enforce it.  Arpaio lost a civil case in 2013, when the court ruled that his office had systematically violated the constitutional rights of Latinos by stopping people based on racial profiling, and detaining them based solely on the suspicion that they were in the country illegally. The court ordered him to stop these practices, he ignored the court for years.  If the president can pardon anyone who defies court orders to enforce constitutional protections, then those constitutional protections are rendered meaningless.

Dolan's Giacomo pizza, triggering an internal investigation into your diet because, God forbid, one of their guest contributors couldn't possibly be a liar, for that would undermine their credibility as a news source.  Then CB (of course) found it to be completely unsubstantiated.  Years later your credibility was called into question when you wrote an article chastising a politician's behavior.  The politician's attorney, in an attempt to discredit your condemning article, subpoenas CB for any records of misconduct they have on you.

The truth is that a doctor doing procedures at a Private Surgical Facility it removing those hours from the Public system. Government policy limits the number of Docs who graduate each year.

Let me try this again, if not for John, then for others who might be curious what the Catholic Church teaches about suffering, pain, and intimate union with God (see Salvivici Doloris for some very beautiful writing & teaching on this matter).  St Paul is talking about deep & intimate unity with Jesus Christ, in fact a total and trusting abandonment into His care, and a oneness with the will of God.  His motives are our motives.  St Paul is """"rejoicing"""" in the sufferings that God is allowing for the good of others.  He is imitating Jesus Christ, even in suffering.  One can't do that without a ready presence (influence) of God,  a lively interior life.  As I said, John doesn't yet have the integrality of Scripture needed to fit such matters together, how """"happiness & pain"""" are not at odds.  How one can actually rejoice while suffering.

I do not think you have enough data there to judgmentally proclaim that the woman is delusional. That is a very harsh judgment of yours to make, in the absence of sufficient data.  I would be curious to hear the woman's response to this question: What do you think the odds would have been for a normal life if he had gotten treatment very early on?  If her answer was """"50/50"""", then that would be evidence for your harsh accusation.  If her answer was """"one in a million, but look, people win lotteries with worse odds"""", then no, that would not be evidence in support of delusion.

The legislators who are wanting to get rid of the APS are the very same legislators (mostly) who voted for it in the first place. Another article in today's ADN is discussing the possible purchase of the new LIO! Talk about hypocritical!!! Our representatives in Juneau want the """"Taj MaHawker,"""" but they do not want to keep their promise to our children. Could it possibly be that it is because Mr. Pfeffer and his ilk give campaign contributions and our children do not yet and are they old enough to vote? What is even more shameful is that students who qualify at all for the APS work extremely hard to even qualify--most of my students won't qualify because their high school courses taken are not rigorous enough. The APS helps the creme dela creme of students afford college. If we can give $600 m to oil companies in tax credits, and $32 m to the LIO, $15 m a year for the APS--already saved--is doable.

0,"Rape and sexual assault against women can indeed be classified as hate crimes, although the term was generally intended to include only crimes targeting victims of a certain race, color, religion, and national origin.  However, these days in the United States and elsewhere, it has been expanded to include gender and sexual orientation as well.  But just looking at the United States alone, you will find some variation in the groups included, for example, a specified age range (either very young, or very old, or both) being listed by some states but not others.  Some authorities would also merge certain categories depending on the circumstances.  Off the top of my head, I'd say the reported systematic mass rapes of women during the Yugoslav Wars of the late 20th century could be termed a hate crime involving both religion and gender, though the term genocidal rape is a more universally accepted term.

That makes them idiots, at best.  And some of the counter-protestors (probably a much smaller proportion than of the 'other guys', but still a significant number) also showed up hoping for a fight. That makes them idiots, at best, as well.  And these rough-tough lunatics created an environment in which a woman died.  Comparisons with Nazi Germany are very popular nowadays, but we're not there yet, not by a long shot. However, we seem to be moving a little closer to Weimar Germany, with its running street battles between the Communists and the SA. And we all know what happened next... However, I think the most apt historical comparison is the last days of the Roman republic.

Mainstream media coverage of all things political has turned from journalism to political advocacy and everyone knows it.  There are myriad examples of deliberate quote mining and misrepresentation everywhere.  CNN is no angel (deliberately cutting feeds, omitting key context, etc), but neither are most of the media outlets (eg. Fox is probably just as bad).  Their recent ploys at controlling the message by encouraging consumers, companies like Facebook, and governments to censor and regulate news in their favour would be palpably laughable if it wasn't a direct slap in the face for freedom of expression and peoples' right to hear all viewpoints.  Their bid for control smacks of the recent religious ploy at the UN to make blasphemy a hate crime.

She profoundly rebutted """"A central tenet of the universe is that everything evolves.""""  In a nutshell that captures what I believe the Holy Spirit has been screaming at us for the last couple of hundred years, and most dramatically since the discovery of the big bang one hundred years ago. Virtually all previous human thought, and most emphatically all previous theology, assumed the exact opposite--a stable universe and an even more stable arena in which humans, regardless when they live, work out what is true.  Ultimately, I believe we must accept that revelation itself is not only ONGOING (in the minimalist sense that the Holy Spirit continues to attempt to influence us, although profoundly hampered by freedom to not listen), but actually EVOLVES (what she says changes over time, adjusting to our capacity to understand).

I don't think this story got any press in Hawaii, where such emissions are 2-3 times greater than all our sources of GHG pollution.  Needless to say, climate change from GHG pollution is an existential threat to Micronesian communities.  This is a difficult problem, but clearly cheaoer flights won't be part of the solution.

The teens who are vaping are either former smokers, or they are vaping with no nicotine, as many studies already show, and has been proven time and again to NOT be a gateway to smoking.  Would you remove seatbelts from cars?  Helmets from motorcycle riders?  Vaping is all about HARM REDUCTION.

0,"You have it backwards. Conquered populations usually assimilate into the conquerors' and disappear as a separate culture. Your own example shows this. Egypt became Arab, the Arabs did not adopt the language and culture of the existing population.  The Romans assimilated most of their conquered populations, with the notable exception of the Jews who refused to be assimilated. We know what happened....  But a lot depends on demographics, i.e. how large the local population is vs the conquerors'. When the conquests happened by land by empires expanding  to the neighbouring populations, assimilation was more likely.  When it started happening overseas with small armies conquering huge populations, that was impossible. Although both the French in North America and the British at the beginning of their domination of India did intermarry and have close relationships with the local populations. Only later did the British start fearing treason and clamp down on fraternizing.

0,"Right Sher, because Sweden has been involved in so many foreign wars and yet their liberal society is being segregated by Islamist extremists. Let's continue to make deflection as opposed to staring at the hard truths staring everyone in the face. Every country governed by Islamic law has no freedom of religion, no gender equality, no freedom of sexual orientation - this has nothing to do with wars or cultural relativism, it has to do with right and wrong. Western societies are the most progressive in the world in every sense of the word. Societies governed by religious law are not (without exception) - just look at the state of civil society among the 57 members of the OIC - it's taken an Islamist in Turkey 10 years to roll back 70 years of secularism, go figure.

0,"Yes, there are some vibrant parishes, but that vibrancy is not always real.  Even in the most so-called vibrant parishes there are often many who are on the sidelines.  That's not how a Christian community ought to be. I think that the institutional Church ossified a long time ago.  That's why John 23 called the council; he knew that there was a drastic need for renewal.  Unfortunately, Paul 6 slowed that down and JP2 caused it to take a U-turn.  We are reaping the fruits.  The handling of the sex abuse scandal is just another example of the clericalist grip on the institution.  The irony here is that they are literally pushing themselves into complete irrelevance.

0,"Ask Germany.  The global perception of """"made in Germany"""" is that it means higher quality, cool design, higher prices. And consumers, especially Asian consumers, lap it up.  Personally I believe that Japanese autos offer far better quality to price value, but no matter. Perception is reality.  Canadian companies, especially branch plant auto,  believe that they must join the race to the bottom in price, with quality secondary.  Wrong. The companies profiled prove this.  Another example:  Canadian beef, especially Alberta beef (range fed). Far, far tastier than US or other foreign beef, but we fight country of origin labelling tooth and nail.  Wrong again. Embrace protectionist pressures in the US, and start campaigns to sell the quality, the superior taste of Canadian beef.  Congrats to the winners that fight for quality. The others, like branch plant auto, are just whistling past the graveyard.

Some excluded under the original BAN were green card holders traveling back after business or family encounters abroad.  The first round of lawsuits caused re-writing of the Travel Ban.  The second ensured that, at the very least, employment, educational, and bona fide relationship travelers were admitted, were not going to be excluded only because of nationality (what Chin and his colleagues in other states WON).

Along with supporting Iran in developing nuclear weapons while Irans mullahs threaten to destroy Israel  he showed his contempt for Israel months ago. So why is anyone surprised?  He did not have the courage to speak  about the murder of JEWS in the Paris  grocery store. He is a coward. Personally I believe Israel should not  build more settlements.

Lol, ok let's unpack this little nugget of wisdom.  Clearly we have to ignore political power because that just wouldn't fit the narrative.  So we'll go with economic and social power which Pierre points to. The black middle class is bigger than the white middle class (and growing), blacks pay more tax, and blacks control 23% of the JSE compared to 22% by whites. And who controls the social narrative Pierre? Well, the fact that we have exhibits that proclaim """"Fuck White People"""", politicians calling for dispossession of white owned land, numerous black editors, a plethora of black musicians, actors and artists one would sort of imagine that there isn't exactly social exclusion of blacks.  What does the perceived power of a race have to do with individual right to artistic expression anyway? Does definition of hate speech change?

He claimed that Mary only bore Christ’s human nature in her womb, thus fracturing Christ into two separate persons (one human and one divine, joined in a sort of loose unity), only one of whom was in her womb.  The Assyrian Church of the East, historically regarded as a Nestorian church, now rejects Nestorianism and is in the process of coming into full ecclesial communion with the Catholic Church.

Trying to describe our world without that is like trying to describe the circulatory system without mentioning the heart.  More to the point, the Bible isn't bad literature. Parts of it are hard for modern readers to engage but that's true of so much important literature that it's a silly point to make. Ever try to read Beowulf? Milton? Rousseau? Homer? Cicero?

0,"My father was misdiagnosed with stomach flu when in fact his illness was stomach ulcers.  His Dr.'s advice of take aspirin and stay in bed worsened the condition rapidly leading to major surgery and colostomy.  He was 35.  I had one hip replaced last year at St. Mike's. My surgeon broke my femur AND my pelvis, something virtually unheard of.  The blame was laid specifically my weak bones.  Turns out (no surprise) aside from me wearing my hips out prematurely the problem isn't mine.  My bone density is of a much younger man. The problem was a prosthesis that was too large. I have a hip filled with metal screws, plates and bands.  My wife had exploratory surgery at Mt. Sinai for abdominal tumors, as per x-rays.  Afterwards, the surgeon berated her in the recovery room for wasting hospital resources since there was nothing wrong with her.  A few short years later, a Dr. at Sunnybrook removed 5 very large but thankfully benign tumors.  Lesson, don't believe everything Dr.'s tell you.

Of the Syrian refugees admitted so far to the U.S., half are children and only 2 percent are single men of combat age. This year the Obama administration wants to increase Syrian refugees to 10000. For a sense of proportion, there are 4.3 million U.N. registered Syrian refugees.  A few politicians and pundits have claimed the Obama administration wants to bring in 250,000 Syrian refugees. That number has no basis in fact. The 85000 number you mentioned is the TOTAL number of refugees from ALL parts of the world the U.S. will bring in this year, NOT THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN REFUGEES.

I would read """"go and do likewise"""" as an injunction to provide care for the injured, not to ignore your own people (of your nation) because outsiders will care for them. That seems like a call for the people of the nation to care for the injured of the nation instead of leaving it to outsiders.  Primarily the parable is about something more fundamental, who is my neighbor. There are no outsiders, there is only those who need help, those who seek to help others. It seems odd to exclude government from that process.

Even one of our presidential candidates has been questionable about her charity. Garrett Tossoro is an example. The paper wrote a great story about his wife as a humanitarian. She keeps a change jar and sells all kinds of stuff for the orphanage in her village and make lots of money. I talked to a person from the same village in Vietnam she said they haven't got an orphanage there. His wife goes and harnesses business owners for free stuff. So where does the money go?

0,"Any discussion of Waldorf Schools is incomplete without mentioning the founding philosophy of them. Steiner was a clairvoyant mystic whose visions told him that humans existed in a spiritual hierarchy with blue-eyed and blonde Germans being the most spiritually developed and intelligent. Through a process of karma and reincarnation the 'lower' races could improve and evolve in the Aryan ideal. Steiner Schools are the spiritual midwiffery home of Steiner's occult beliefs known as Anthroposophy. The schools exist to help children incarnate from their previous existences into their new form. This process takes place over seven year cycles. This is the reason are not taught to read and write until their adult teeth arrive around year seven when their first major incarnation event happens.  Parents are not told about the spiritual aims of the school. Anthroposophy can be best thought of as an initiated cult - you will told of more beliefs about Anthroposophy as you become deeper involved.

0,"I mostly disagree with the points and assumptions  in this article.  First, lots of mortgages have rates of 2.5% or less. Your current mortgage rate will be a major factor in your decision. The lower the rate, the less value in paying it down faster.  Second, using a conservative (balanced) investment strategy (one that is expected to grow at 4-6% per year) within your TFSA will most likely be a suitable choice for anyone who is really debating whether to accelerate paying down their mortgage principal or not.  The article mentions that someone contemplating a possible default should be more likely to elect to pay off the mortgage instead of investing. This could not be more wrong.  Setting up the TFSA will serve as an emergency fund and would provide a much better safety net than would just a smaller mortgage balance.  Try going to the bank after losing your income (sickness or layoff) and see how difficult it is to borrow back some of your equity.

Taqiyya is a moral duty. No other religion has such a thing as Taqiyya. It is anathema to western thought, and so it is hard for non-Muslims to understand that it actually exists and is used regularly against western culture and political stability.  The worst part is that the police, and liberal media like the Globe, are now giving us  the taqiyya   voluntarily, doing Islams dirty work.

0,"The difference is that in a murder trial, consent can't be given (I don't think you're allowed to have a duel anymore). In this case, the act could be committed, but not be a crime if consent was given. That's a pretty fundamental difference. The question was not around whether the act happened or whether the accused did the act, that was far beyond any reasonable doubt. Reasonable doubt only rested with whether or not consent was given, which the accuser can't remember. That's a pretty big hole in the Crown's case.

The Republican leadership in Washington DC currently lead by Mitch McConnell is a fine example of incompetence.  However, the House of Representatives being lead by Paul Ryan, age 46, shows incompetence doesn't discriminate by age.  President Obama has tried from the beginning of his Presidency to make our nation healthy again only to face one obstructionist roadblock after another set forth by the Republicans; John Boehner did it as the Speaker of the House and now Mitch McConnell is doing it as the Senate Majority Leader.  President Obama has nominated a competent judge for the vacancy on the Supreme Court, his age of 63 should not be a factor in determining whether he is qualified for the seat.  The US Senate needs to hold confirmation hearings and hold a straight up and down vote.  The senators are supposed to be adults, it'seems time to start acting like adults.  Gladys

Then again, perhaps not.  Two years ago, two UO basketball players, standing side-by-side with their teammates, held their hands up at shoulder height in protest.

There are indications that some GMOs are unsafe.  For example, every cell of one particular GMO contains the genetic material of a bacterium that produces a toxin.  It was once thought that the toxin would be destroyed in the human digestive system, but it has recently been found in human blood.  GMOs pose a risk to human health.  That's why you can't cite a single scientific study that concludes that any GMO is safe for humans to consume on a long term basis.

A good comprehensive review should have provided a few different scenarios (including things like deferring CPP) without having to ask for them to rerun the numbers.  It isn't as if they have to recompute everything by hand.  Particularly given that this issue has gotten a lot of press lately.  2.) They speak of having """"financial advisers"""" who appear to be managing their investments.  But yet they don't trust those advisers when it comes their ability to come up with a financial plan to see them through retirement.  So the solution is to outsource that job for $1,600 + a few hundred each time it needs to be reviewed.  While I generally concur that fee for service planners are a better option I don't get paying multiple financial advisers and then being smug because those on the investment side aren't happy.

Season 3 is about a  49-year old woman who is raped after a party she attends.   Nasty stuff too.

In fact, the move to independence and the establishment of a government based on a constitution was a radical move--not as radical as the French Revolution--but radical nevertheless. And in the political alignments of its time, a liberal move, not conservative. Further, most of the major changes that flowed from that initial liberal revolution are liberal themselves, with conservatives usually in opposition. The end of slavery, the establishment of a national bank, and the eventual financial system that made the industrial revolution in this country possible, the concept of a social safety net, the union movement, our entry into world politics, the civil rights movement, the environmental movement, the emancipation of the LGBT community were and are liberal in their orientation.

0,"mira, Their is no question in my mind that the Government needs to adequately fund social services in First Nations communities, especially with respect to youth programs and education.  I'd be happy to see Canada contribute above the national average for each and every First Nations child. That being said, their is no clear established link between the under funding of these programs in general (aside from mental health funding) at present and the increasing instance of youth suicide. On the contrary, where youth suicide is not a result of a psychological ailment (this is where Canada is failing now), it is far more common for youth suicides to occur, not as a result of poverty or reduced access to services, but as a result of psychological trauma that has occurred within the family, in peer relationships, or within the community more generally. So, First Nations communities do indeed need to reflect on their impact on youth suicide and what needs to change to address it.

The order then gives the State Department another 60 days to “submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.” The Mexican government and military received nearly $420 million in assistance in 2013, with most of the money going to economic development.

The Trump organisation was involved in a hotel project in Azerbaijan that really was a money laundering scheme for the then corrupt Azerbaijan politicians. I'm confident that this was not the first project where the Trump brand was used to help a corrupt country. This is why Trump has to release all of his tax returns showing his conflicts of interest where the United States has sanctions. I'm also confident that Trump has massive conflicts in Russia with Putin. This is why politicians have to divest themselves of their businesses while in power. Trump has not done this whatsoever.

0,"EV batteries are fully recyclable, and unlike the lead acid batteries in gas cars, are completely non-toxic and do not contain any heavy metals. An EV battery contains around 10 kg of recyclable lithium versus the 10,000’s of kilograms of gasoline that is burnt by a gas car over its life. Contrast the minimal impact of battery production with the numerous waste streams produced by gasoline powered cars, which include: all of the toxic by-products of mining, extracting processing and refining the fuels, the tonnes of emissions produced by each gasoline car each year, the billions of litres of polluted engine oil, transmission fluid and coolants resulting from servicing gas powered cars, the contamination from underground fuel tanks, pipeline leaks, train and truck accidents, the groundwater impacts of fracking, the pollution of the oceans from spills, ballast water and oil well blow outs, etc. Oil production is clearly orders of magnitude more toxic and harmful than batteries.

0,"At the high end of normal road construction costs, this should be a roughly $1 million project.  But that should be phase 2. Phase 1 should be the cheaper, far more effective solution: fix the terrible traffic lights in this area. There is no reason the Albertson's parking lot and 4th Ave (important as 4th may be, it is still a side street), should be consistently getting priority over Highway 96.  The lights are really what cause the congestion here. The traffic volume is relatively modest.  All of these lights should be coordinated to each other. This has been suggested before, but the county claimed it couldn't be done because WSDOT controls the two lights at the I-5 interchange. That's nonsense that presumes:  (a) The county could not propose the idea to WSDOT and even offer to fund it (WSDOT has no reason to refuse, lacking any other lights they need these coordinated to).  (b) Even if WSDOT refused, the other lights could not simply follow the I-5 light timings.

This comes at a cost to the citizens of this city in the form of lower wages and lost opportunity to our working class, higher housing costs and added taxpayer burden to support illegal alien children in our public school system. There are about 55,000 illegal aliens here in Denver out of a population of 700,000 according to Pew. Getting rid of them will reduce school overcrowding, increase the availability of affordable housing, improve the outrageous traffic situation and reduce the indigent burden on Denver Health. Sounds like a politicians dream, right? But since our city is run by politicians from the looney left, rewarding foreign lawbreakers is more important than the interests of the citizens of Denver.

This whole idea that you can compare the unfounded rate of one type of crime to another, or even to all others, is bogus right from the get go. Physical assault - almost always bruises, cuts or scratches to support the accusation. Sexual assault - not so much. What then is the evidence of a stolen kiss or a touch (both of which count as sexual assault)? To simply assert that the unfounded rates should be similar is a sign of a deliberate attempt to manipulate public opinion. And all the figures you come up with about rates of unfounded this or that do not change that one iota. First the definition of sexual assault becomes inflated and then the resulting increase in unfounded reports is seen as evidence of bias. This is propaganda of the first order.

They have created a culture of fear combined with the ability to enforce their will through the power of government and institutional intimidation as opposed to actually changing hearts. The only way to disrupt that dysfunction is by pointing out what they are doing, and that if the grievance industry and leftists really were serious about improving race relations they would use forgiveness instead, as MLK admonished them to. Yet it is hard for them to make that shift for fear of being attacked as racist themselves. When a person is threatened with loss of livelihood and reputation, it is a powerful negative incentive which has the effect of reinforcing the mob mentality. Whether you are liberal or conservative, this whole mentality must be rejected.  http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/love-and-forgiveness

Dear DM Editors, Please get over this Russia thing, it has taken CNN from number one watched news channel in the US to, as some say, behind Yogi Bear reruns in popularity. They, the Clinton's, the Democratic Party and CNN, have been trying to prove collusion between Trump and the Russians that got him elected. What got him elected was Hilary, she lost, nothing else. Do you think the US is not trying to interfere in the domestic policy of just about every country they think matters? Russia does the same, China does the same, a piddling $250,000 ad campaign on Twitter is not going to change the way the people think. Dem. Sen. Mark Warner says it is """"Deeply disappointing and inadequate"""", yes it is, because they didn't find anything to incriminate Trump. So please DM stick to uncovering local corruption and stop repeating CNN BS. Thanks.

I eagerly await the Trump Administration's crackdown on sanctuary cities. Cut off all Federal funding. Withdraw the FAA air traffic controllers and Homeland Security from DIA and shut it down.

0,"It pains me to see the 'liberals' or post-war neo-liberals not get it. We currently have a mode of though as a result of the war. It is intergration, co-dependence and diversity. This was thought to be the best method to prevent another war in Europe.  But there isa fundamental flaw when this model expanded to globalization. The flaw is that the original model assumed that there would be a comminality in culture, ideas, values between the region to integrate. When this model becomes dysfunctional is when unlike regions are integrated, especially when other region are traditionally authoritrian or a former regional theocracy.  This is why Trump got elected. The model has boiled down to 'well, we're all human', but fails to account that a choice about which values are consider the most important, it trying to continuously force ralid, unwanted and unneccessary cultural change.

And different from speaking to a rogue nation where his dynamic words most likely caused it to back down, after his strong rejection of bigotry and racism, this riot was local.

Ask yourself this: is it sane behavior to take a loaded gun to threaten youngsters at a rowdy party? Is it responsible to approach and threaten them with that gun? The placement of the shots leads one to think the """"fight"""" was over and the victims were shot when their backs were turned. Did he in cold blood shoot them when they were leaving? This reminds me of the case in Eugene, years ago, of a jerk who was angry at a group of kids standing around his vehicle near his place of work and who assumed those kids had been responsible for damage to his truck: he shot and I believe killed one of them.

0,"The very concept of """"sweater"""" is a cultural appropriation, in this context--but also an example of cultural exchange. Knitting was introduced to the indigenous women by, among others, missionary nuns. An immigrant woman from the Shetlands is credited with the idea of adding designs to the garments the women were producing. And soon the women themselves were """"appropriating"""" (and adapting) the designs they saw on sweaters worn by the local--British--fishermen. Apparently, the actual knitting technique is itself an adaptation (not mere """"adoption"""") of the Shetland techniques; that's what makes the sweaters unique. When in the 1940s a Manitoba company began to mass-produce Cowichan sweater """"knock-offs,"""" ironically a number of the indigenous knitters quickly incorporated their own versions of the """"commercialized"""" designs into their work. Are the sweaters """"indigenous cultural items""""? Or would today's SJW's call them """"symbols of oppression,"""" forced upon the indigenous people by the whites?

It's not a great situation to have to use personal money in a downturn (been there) and it's prudent to make sure you have the resources to pay your employees. But the new measures don't change either of those things .  They're measures to close loopholes in the tax system.  Keeping reserves available isn't necessarily a good use of resources. To get any kind of returns, you'd have those funds locked in, and/or invest in high risk, high return investment. It's only the returns (income on the investment) which are impacted by the new measures. You can pay reasonable dividends to family members who contribute to the business.

Holding up that particular district as a national bellwether seems to me an unreliable indicator of where the nation as a whole stands in relation to Donald Trump. The 2018 midterms will be a more reliable indicator, and they can't come soon enough to rid us of this pestilence that has sullied the office of the presidency, probably for good.

It doesn't matter whether your child attends a district run school, a Catholic school, a Christian school, a Muslim School, a private (non-sectarian) school, or any other type of school.  That said, since tax money is involved, Canada also demands accountability for its use.  For example, in Alberta there is a set of provincial standards that every school must meet.  There is a model provincial curriculum they may follow. There are recommended textbooks, student, parent, and teacher guides that are all aligned with that curriculum. There are provincial assessments in grades 3 (optional), 6, and 9. And every school's results and value added is published annually and widely disseminated. Oh, and Alberta's PISA scores are among the best in the world. Note also that the province's demographics (free and reduced percentage, ELL, rural, etc.) aren't very different from Colorado's.

It's about taxing citizens to the max to fund pointless wars around the world that enrich a few military contractor CEOs.  Military wastes exist because of corporate profits and extortion of money from citizens, not national pride.  I too would sit during the national anthem.  And it's just because of military waste or racism (which is the least of our problems).  I'd sit because of our broken health care system, the polarization of our society that Obama has pushed, the decimation of our industry and the vast corruption of our political system.  I remain seated for anthems of broken countries, like the Un-united States of America.

During the early phase (i.e. with the leader tapping into & channeling the public anger & thereby building the movement into an important political player & even attaining office), the leader has Nik Nanos's win-win aura.  This aura is tested after the leader attains political office but needn't implode quickly.  The leader may score some early successes or his/her followers may see his/her setbacks as caused by the same dark forces to which they attribute their own frustration, anxiety & anger.  However, failures over time by the leader to avoid the mistakes of common political figures and failure to successfully confront and overcome the 'dark forces' against which the movement is arrayed leave the leader vulnerable and his/her fall is often quick and it timing unexpected.

Answer:  The Holy Bible, numerous translations.  The truth is that sin, as defined in the original translations of the Bible, means """"to miss the mark."""" The mark, in this case, is the standard of perfection established by God and evidenced by Jesus. Viewed in that light, it is clear that we are all sinners.

Clause 15 of Humanae Vitae applied Thomas Aquinas' principle of double effect to allow the contraceptive pill to be used for medical problems even though an """"accidental"""" effect was the contraceptive one. When the AIDS epidemic broke out, one would have thought that the use of condoms to avoid infection where one party to a marriage was HIV positive would have been one of those situations that came squarely within Clause 15.

0,"There are many pieces of evidence.  Take a look at Area: The forestry industry claims it wants to be sustainable, yet, after 150years of timber extraction in this country, why do forestry companies continue to push further and further into new territory -- often crown land.  Why is it not possible for them to use the forests they already have? Because they can't and remain profitable at the same time. Second, Why are sensitive species that require high quality forest like Woodland Caribou and Spotted Owl now threatened? Third - forestry companies are subsidized because they don't pay very much for the use of the land -- far less than if they owned it. Taxpayers pay for this.  Forth - all this and the decline in the number of jobs and value added products means Canadians don't benefit. If you want a good model of forestry and forest product manufacturing, look to Finland.

It wouldn’t be any trick at all to automate logins and comment reactions since the G+M has the bar set pretty low – no captchas (which can be beaten anyhow, just try to get decent tickets online).  There are tools available to do that kind of thing, we use them all the time for testing.  Fully automating it would be tough, though, deciding which stories and then which comments should be targeted would be a dark art at best.  It would be easier to have one or two people decide what to target and then set off an automated program with a few dozen user IDs based on that input.  (That’s how we run the test tools, we develop automated scripts).  I have no evidence that this is going on -- but if someone wanted to do it, it wouldn't be all that hard.

They chose to take this vow & they were not required to do differently than any other person seeking the same ministry.  So there is no discrimination & no injustice.  Any person who takes a vow before God should keep that vow.  If they can't, then don't complain if you lose the prestige, as well as the functions, keeping the vow would have allowed you.

0,"It amazes me that the same people who will go on at length about the psychological and social consequences of conquest, domination, imperialism, colonialism, etc., on the conquered, colonialised, dominated, etc., are oblivious to the fact that is exactly what was done to the South by the North.  People who understand that you cannot impose democracy and human rights on societies abroad through the barrel of a gun and humiliation and expect it to stick, you cannot demand people denounce their culture and ancestors as evil and immoral and inferior to the conquerors,  are convinced the North did the right thing by waging a war to abolish slavery in the South.  And yet it should be obvious the North may have won the war, but not the peace, as the saying goes. The resentment and rebellion against the conqueror stills remains, humiliation does that.  The South would likely have abolished slavery voluntarily as it was no longer economically advantageous, with better long-term results.

0,"Why is it so difficult for anyone associated with the Star-Advertiser to bring up the possibility of changing the technology (i.e., steel-on-steel) of rail to bring the project in with available funds? Conversion to urban magnetic levitation (maglev) can stay within the current budget, meet the terms of the Full Funding Grant Agreement, operate on the (modified) existing guideway (that can still be used for acquired steel wheels trains) to Aloha Stadium, and stay automated and elevated on a much less physically and visually imposing maglev-only guideway through town to Ala Moana Center. Maglev deserves a full review by federal officials, who are now looking at the city’s fiscal recovery plan, one that cannot deliver the 20-mile plan. Rather than engage in back-room “skullduggery” in the State Legislature and City Council, our elected officials must demand a full comparison of the current project with the maglev conversion plan. It is time to bring 21st Century rail to O'ahu.

It is unclear how any Trump supporters would """"sell"""" those policy changes to regular, everyday voters. Indeed, both rules are going to benefit the top one percent (suit-wearing executives at the coal and oil companies), not the little voter guy whose family fishes or drinks water from the streams, or who wants more clean, home-grown energy independence for America.

In doing so, both Pope and Paul were imitating Jesus who, in his legal discussions with Pharisees, seems to have almost always favored a pragmatic approach to any issue.

Like any text, its meaning derives from its context. There are no laws without exceptions, e.g. killing is condemned except in self-defense; stealing except to feed one's children.

That is a fact of life, and a part of the diversity of creation. What is harmful is when people who have opinions and interpretations insist on thinking that, or taking action on, or pulling authority rank for, the notion that everyone else should be holding or should be forced or threatened to agree with their opinions and interpretations. That use of force, threat, or arrogant expectation is what harms.

0,"I was led astray as a youth by my father.  Despite his lifelong union membership, he advised me back in the late 1950's, when I started being aware of politics, that the reason we had two political parties was so that when things went wrong, there was always that other party to blame it upon.  Worked in Congress and for the President.  And also at the State level.  He did not differentiate between either of those two parties.  Later, I could see some politicians of both parties, particularly here in Oregon,  who were able to discuss, negotiate and compromise for the good of the State or the  country.  Now, I agree with you that politics has become a pair of  religions, however,  and I believe both are complete with doctrine, theology, catechisms,  apostates, demons and saints.  And of course, secular clergy!  Perhaps it will improve as the older deacons and theologians of each political church die off.  I don't see much other hope.

By 1996, when Bill Clinton signed the so-called welfare reform bill, kicking poor women off of welfare and leaving them at the mercy of low-wage corporations, I knew it was time to leave the party. Nothing will change unless we build up an alternative. I'll be voting for Jill Stein.

The fluoride ions released by “pharmaceutical grade fluoride” are identical to those released by HFA.  Thus the only difference is in the amount of contaminants which may be introduced into the water. Pharmaceutical grade fluoride is made for one shot applications such as in toothpaste and mouthrinses.  So, while the amounts of contaminants in those products is well below the maximum safe level for single shot use, when you multilpy them by the enormous amount it takes to fluoridate a water system, the amount of those contaminants will exceed those associated with HFA, which is manufactured for large volume use. . Therefore, not only is “pharmaceutical grade fluoride” far more expenssive than HFA, it is also potentially more dangerous to use for fluoridation.  to be cont.. . Steven D. Slott, DDS

To file a lawsuit (Doug Chin) based upon supposition (no one was harmed, no one was even slightly in any way inconvenienced) is absurd.  For a federal judge to allow hearsay as suppositional or circumstantial evidence is minor league play.  He (judge Watson) FELT that our President was discriminating against muslims.  Okay.  Still no one was harmed.  No one filed a suit.

He needs to refrain from speaking off the cuff and more carefully rather than  saying whatever comes to mind.  And the suspension of the Jones Act for only 10 days is ridiculously too short as it will take much longer for shippers to redirect ships and cargo to bring aid to Puerto Rico.  Then there is the rebuilding effort that will need to take place again requiring supplies and equipment  being shipped to Puerto Rico. If anything the Jones Act needs to be suspended for several months to a year at least. The lesson here whether it was Katrina or now Maria, is that people need to prepare for such a disaster and be ready to help themselves and not expect that government, local or federal is going to save your bacon.

And, medical users are forbidden to shop around - forced by Health Canada to purchase from only one supplier.  A quick look at menus from many legal suppliers indicate a dearth of selection, and some only have supply of low-grade cannabis - their higher-grade products fly off the shelves within hours.  Cyanide-tainted cannabis sold by Licensed Producers, and the lack of products on their websites, has left a massive opening for illegal dispensaries to fill the gap in Health Canada's broken distribution model.  Illegal storefront and online dispensaries provide a better selection of quality cannabis, at a better price, including offering imported and domestic hashish, concentrated oils and shatters, and edible products.  Licensed producers cannot carry hashish and other concentrates.  Until legalization, dispensaries should be tolerated.

Collective bargaining should be realistic in demands, and transparency is crucial to good-faith negotiating.  But unions came into being for a reason, because of abuses of workers by their bosses. Profit-sharing plans are great and can be implemented by a good tax accountant, at request of management.   The problem is power: how can employees get answers from their bosses, without enough power behind them?  How can they get information about profits, without power to demand records?  I've known CEO's (or middle management) to listen respectfully to an employee spokesperson and then say """"I'm sorry we just can't afford to do that (wage increase, profit-sharing, insurance, etc.)  But you can try again next year.""""  Workers, knowing how easily they can be replaced, just keep their heads down.   Even with all their faults, large unions are sometimes the only hope for improvement

0,"Generally developers are not popular.  The OMB has allowed them to run rough-shod over neighborhoods and municipalities for years as they built high-rises and paved over the best farmland in the country.  On the other-hand the goverment has promoted an ever-increasing population through mass immigration and these people all need somewhere to live, work, study, and shop.  This has fueled the demand is the root-cause of the need for exponential development growth.  Promoting the exponential growth in immigration and the the population on one hand and restricting development on the other will  only lead to more housing inflation.  So which will it be now?  Growth or no growth?

0,"RT has been around for a long time, I probably first saw it online over 10 years ago.  Now it's getting a lot of airtime, since there's some questions about Trump's links to Russia - but its subtle misinformation has influenced a lot of people here in North America already.  Its primary success is to actually have people you meet tell you about the utter corruption of U.S. and/or Canadian government and that by comparison, Vladimir Putin's Russia is really not so bad.   You could argue that Trump's victory as an outlier who's not part of the corrupt U.S. establishment is the outcome of over a decade of people listening to RT and soaking up its spin.  The production is slick, with lots of attractive British sounding young people acting as the anchors, and at first glance you might even think you stumbled across an alternative British news site.  No apparent lies, just positioning.  80+ years of propaganda taught the Russians something, that's for sure.

0,"The potential to attack from Level 6 down onto passengers on Level 5 can easily be eliminated right now by simply installing the tall glass panels shown in the preview video.  Another option would be erecting a ballistic glass canopy over the screening queues.  That would then reduce the problem to preventing attack from Level 5 itself, which as you point out can be done with a focused security presence.  There should be more watchful eyes focused on the various entrances anyway, as there are many avenues into the building and plentiful opportunities to create carnage that don't even involve the checkpoint queues.  In fact, under the proposal the southern third of the terminal would remain outside security to serve non-passenger meeters/greeters.  This in itself would create a more concentrated mass of people who would be unprotected, turning the current advantage of crowd dispersal throughout the terminal's vast space into a liability.  Seems no different than the present problem.

Everyone who disagrees with them are to be labeled with a demeaning label. Facts only matter when they are used against all outside the party. Failures of the party both present and past are to be ignored and dismissed, in fact failures of the parties programs are never to be even considered as a failure despite any and all facts to the contrary.  For the dems. blind loyalty is what is required. The dem. voter is not allowed to look at the hypocrisy of their party or themselves, as I mentioned, they are only allowed to blindly follow.

0,"Darius,  You missed the point entirely. If Arpaio's parents had entered the U.S. in present day Arizona and confronted Arpaio or someone like him, he would have arrested and/or deported them as he has done in many similar cases over the past few years. It's not a matter of being legal or illegal. His parents were neither until they arrived at Ellis Island where they were granted legal status and allowed entry. Had they confronted someone like Arpaio today, there's a good chance they would not have been allowed to stay. BTW: I'm not a leftist. Just like you, I'm an average patriotic American ... also a Vietnam era veteran. When you use the word 'leftist' like you did, it's a confrontational use of that word and leads to more divisiveness in this country which is anti-American and unpatriotic.  Best,  RTD

The Orthodox Liturgy is about what hasn't even happened yet--the transfigured world. This is the entire meaning of iconography, to make the unseen real, and why it is part of our theology, not just pretty pictures. When you receive communion, you are receiving the transfigured Christ. Some people may argue the finer points and there may be some variation from region to region but it has been said many times about the two liturgies--one seems forever centred on Calvary; the other on Pascha.  There is some parting of ways on the whole notion of atonement too, mostly a reaction to Anselm, but then, there are some Orthodox thinkers who think Anselm's ideas are correct.

Alaska's Cook Inlet production is down from 270,000 barrels per day to 17,000 and the North Slope is down to 490,000 barrels per day from 2 million barrels per day and the Trans Alaska Pipeline may be shut down due to this massive decline and that will hurt the state and most all the great people of Alaska!  The harsh laws of Alaska that support the major's monopoly, keep investors out but the current incentives and credits helps drillers keep finding multi-Billion barrel oil discoveries like Armstrong has and Caelus has, why kill the those that are saving the state?? Furi and Blue Crest have Trillions of cubic Feet and lots of new oil about to come online, so why stop the progress when oil prices have dropped so low all progress can be stopped if HB 247 is allowed, vote it down or Alaska will suffer for decades to come

0,"Adjusting for """"capex"""" is hardly an exact science, hence my comment about maintenance expenditures (which hit the P&L) vs. """"capex"""", which is capitalized and depreciated.  But you gotta try!  Just looking at cash flow, without looking at capex - in any business, but especially in a capital intensive biz - is a very slippery slope.  There are a lot of businesses where capex """"lasts for a generation"""".  Does ENB's cash flow statement differentiate between """"maintenance"""" capex and """"new business"""" capex""""?  And yes, """"cash flow"""" is ALWAYS after interest expense, cuz cash flow should be net income plus non cash deductions (primarily, for most businesses, depreciation).  I personally think that ENB ended up with too large of a halo, driven by a bunch of years of very good results, which may or may not be sustainable...and that a lot of people own the shares without really understanding the business financials...which I do think is """"complicated"""".

If you catch an actor with a hooker, it’s front page news, but if I’m caught smoking crack with a hooker, I’m some sort of hero. It’s like, ‘Yeah! Alright, Kid Rock!’”  There's more, look them up, but none of them are fit to print in a family newspaper.

0,"There is a huge gaping hole in this proposal, i.e., on the basis of what information does the individual who extrapolates a personality profile from social media expression confirm that his/her extrapolation is correct?  Another item to consider here is that perhaps we should not ignore that people who use social media as a deeply integrated part of their life are a unique personality-profile group in and of themselves.  This in much the same way that a standard deviation should probably be factored when concluding where--in relation to """"normal""""--anyone stands who takes their personal or family problems into public exposure on a TV program or """"reality"""" TV.    Social media, and its adoption in the minds of some as providing real and reliable social connection, is in itself an intriguing psychological framework to be studied.  It would be interesting to see the psychological profiles of people who use social media on a chronic, daily basis, and those who don't.  Very interesting.

You may have a different definition of such, that's fine respectfully AL CUMMINGS; but in the eyes of many it's cheating, and it reflects on a candidate's integrity and ethical standards, as well as the media source and the party.   Very few lies? Like taking sniper fire in Bosnia? Like her daughter was a block away from ground zero on 9/11? Who she was named after? There was no classified info on her personal computer?

0,"I don't think the parable of tepid water was in our Lords intention nor included in the bible, and it is not part of the traditional interpretation of the Church. It is true that the city of Laodicea was none for its lukewarm water, it was also known for being lax in its ways due to riches.  Read the rest of the revelations 3 15-22 and our Lord says clearly """"Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. Be zealous therefore, and do penance.""""  Following His will half heartedly is of no use. It is one thing to try fervently and fail, but it is another thing to be lax and still expect grace to come.  Being fervent about the Church's faith and compassionate are not mutually exclusive. Saint Nicholas who gifted many who were poor and destitute also was the same man who punched Arius in the face for being a heretic. He was anything but lukewarm.

He appointed many non-English and French Canadians to senate and other important positions.  But Dief never supported official multi-culturalism introduced by Trudeau 1.0 in 1971 in a departure from the B&B Commission's recommendations.  And he would be apoplectic at Trudeau 2.0's watering down our citizenship and immigration policies and requirements and his bizarre notion of Canada as a non-nation, a post national state without a shared, unifying national identity.

But when we tell folks that we don't know from Adam - whose political support we seriously disagree with - that they are stupid, misguided, or in need of electro shock - particularly if we are masquerading as some arbiter or truth and rational thought -(which Haycox always sees himself as) - then we stop being agents of change and start being agents of war.

I believe John Locke was correct in his 2nd Treatise on Government when he stated that whenever someone takes from the commons they are obligated to leave as much and as good behind them so others may likewise lift themselves up from the base nature of man. Whenever anybody takes more of land and resources than can be sustained for everybody who wants the same they are obligated to make full recompense for the loss to the others.

0,"Assuming McCain is true to his word, not necessarily a valid assumption but probably legit in this case, this fecal sandwich could still pass. Collins is also likely to remain true to her opposition to killing tens of millions of Americans by stripping them of health care, but that still leaves a need for one more no vote.  Rand Paul flips and flops his way through life. I wouldn't count on his vote. He said he would vote against the so-called skinny repeal as well but ended up supporting it. Murkowski shut down the prior attempt to strip millions of coverage, but this bill is being sweetened with pork for Alaska, so her vote is still in doubt in spite of her governor being strongly opposed to this thing.  I'll stop holding my breath when my calender shifts to October 1, at which point any bill to kill tens of millions of Americans would require sixty votes instead of a mere fifty.  I honestly don't know how people can support the GOP and still sleep at night.

0,"I don't think the NDP will necessarily make BC affordable, but many hope they will try to make it more liveable. The Clark regime simply promised more of the same policies that have caused considerable resentment. It's no coincidence that skyrocketing housing prices in the province started when the BC Liberals took power in 2001. When  families making six figures can't afford a three bedroom townhouse, or they pay $3000 a month in rent, the term """"low income housing"""" takes on a new meaning.  Meanwhile, Clark has made absolutely no attempt to appeal to young people, families or anyone else really except for those boomers who won the housing lottery. Most want a government for the people and by the people. Instead, ours is currently run in the name of special interest groups who pay large sums for access to the Premier. In light of that and when faced with complete indifference - if not contempt - by Clark to the plight of the less fortunate, it's easy to choose anyone but her.

0,"Hi, Neko. There's enough smoke for a reasonable person to believe that Bill Clinton was at least guilty of using his power and influence to take advantage of women. Whether it adds up to criminal behavior or not, I don't know. But it's fair to say that some (not all) on the left have shown a double-standard regarding Bill Clinton, just as some on the right are now doing regarding Trump.  But Bill's guilt or innocence is a different issue than Hillary's. To my mind, it's unjust to lay any of this at her doorstep. For political reasons, she can't come out and say it, but the fact is she was victimized by her husband. Yes, she publicly supported him (as many spurned political wives do), but there is no credible evidence supporting the notion that she was complicit in punishing the women he had relationships with.  For Trump to blame her is not only unjust but extremely foolish from a political perspective. Sure, it's raw meat for his base, but it completely puts off everybody else.

One employee who was too obese to work and was close to requiring dialysis refused to attend a rehab program (that the employer was paying for) because it cost him too much for gas to get there.

What percentage ancestry do I have to have to be allowed to express a view?  Can I not write a book about seals unless I am Inuit?  Can I not write a book on the history of Great Britain if I don't have British ancestors?  Can I not speak out about cultures that oppress women unless I am of that culture?  Real culture is how people live and is subject to constant change, not the remnants of the practices of outdated and irrelevant civilizations.

Do a little research and you can confirm this for yourself.  Invasion of another's personal space is a very common way to assert superiority.  It may be """"man to man"""", but more often it's a man asserting his power over the woman.  Kruse, it seems, was perceived by women to be doing so.  Ms Gelser requested he cease.  He didn't.  She took her concern to Senator Cortney who formally demanded Mr. Kruse cease the behavior.  It seems he didn't.  He's paying the price for his behavior....That is called """"logical consequences"""".  Mr. Kruse is NOT the victim here.

0,"Millions of jobs in the US depend on supply lines that have been established with Mexico under NAFTA. Almost half of wha we import from Mexico was exported from the US to Mexico for assembly and then exported back to the US. This cost saving helps US manufacturers of cars like Jeep and the Ford Mustang to remain competitive with US factories and US labor with items like transmissions, and interior mechanisms, being exported to Mexico for assembly and then imported for installation in the US. Our three major imports from Mexico are supply chain items like Vehicles, machinery, and electrical machinery-- make up $186 Billion of US imports from Mexico, everything else totals just $47 Billion. US business will support some changes, but they cannot afford to change these supply relationships. Mexico is being courted by several other countries for this business and US manufacturers will face cost changes that could force US manufacture outside the US. Or whole cars will be built in Mexico.

Gara's hidden agenda is to use money owed to oil companies and funnel it to education so that Anchorage teachers can get there annual 1.5% pay raises. He doesn't care about the average private sector worker trying to make a living and being able to afford healthcare for their families.

0,"JJ, Thanks for the clarification.  I would like to point out in your post, slavery was legal in Britain until 1833.  The War of 1812 began in 1812 (small joke there).  Essentially the British were offering American slaves their freedom to fight against the Americans of any color or creed.  I wonder if those freed slaves received the same pay and whatever benefits of a regular British soldier, if they even considered fighting America would free American slaves, assuming the British would even allow it as victors?  I may get around to looking that up.  So those freed American slaves now became deadly enemies to all of America.  Killing them was more than justified and including this in the poem/song is more than acceptable, especially at the time written.  The song/poem has become self expunged so I can only come to the conclusion that this is another attempt at race baiting using faulty history and logic.  I do agree, American slaves could see the freed slaves now British, as heroes.

0,"Okay people lets get one thing clear, the current health care model is broken because the government is subsidizing insurance companies profits. Healthcare insurance companies pay hundreds of billions of dollars in dividends to their investors every year. These moneys are a result of the profits the said healthcare insurance companies make on the premiums they collect, and investments they buy that yield returns with all these revenues..... then subtracted by the cost of running their business and claims paid. Just understand this part first.......  Medicare for all eliminates the insurance companies out of the equation and entertains a different model, noted below-  Premiums collected """"either monthly or by increased taxes"""", then funds investments yielding a return generating profits and also funds used to pay claims and reinvest. The difference between the two models is SAVING BILLIONS as no dividends paid, better leverage with price drugs/service, & less admin cost -Med ALL better!!

0,"They are interesting and reasonable options within the GIC investment space.  But people do need to read the small print to fully understand what they are getting.  For example a 5 year GIC will usually quote a maximum return of 25% but that 25% is cumulative over the  5 year period.  Also your return is still 100% interest income and will be taxed as such.  Most also allow the investor to pick from around 5 different index that their GIC will be linked to.  I use them for my kids RESP provincial grant money that unfortunately the brokerages wouldn't manage alongside the regular federal program.  So I was forced to find a regular bank product.  So far have averaged about 3.5% annual return.

0,"The reality is somewhere in the middle.  Alberta would be far better off (over the long term) if it chose to implement a provincial sales tax (of 5%) - for maximum efficiency it would make sense for it to be harmonized to reduce administration and compliance costs.  The additional revenue raised could displace royalty revenues that currently fund operational expenses.   Those royalties could be directed to the Heritage Fund (similar to Alaska) to generate benefits for future generations.  That approach would be conservative. -- This is not to say that Alberta does not have a spending problem.  Wages for civil servants, teachers, doctors et al - are substantially higher than in other  jurisdictions (in particular BC and I think SK).  Program reviews should be done on all Alberta government programs to validate whether they are still needed and if so, if they are efficient, effective and cost effective.  By doing these things, Alberta would be better off.   No free lunch.

Since Social Security operates off of a trust fund, it should not be considered part of spending.

This seems to be a rock on which the Republicans are determined to wreck themselves.  Don't forget, however, that Obama wanted to make a budget deal with the Republicans in exchange for cuts in SS yearly cost of living increases. Al Gore, as I recall, had a similar bright idea.

Now the perpetrator is known as a racist and not as the sum of his life's experience and work.

Truman reasonably believed that given the disparity in conventional forces, the only way to prevent the Soviet Union from taking over Europe was to have a nuclear deterrent.  With hindsight, it would have been better if the major powers had somehow come to an enforceable agreement which would have guaranteed the security of Western Europe while stopping cold nuclear proliferation.  It is highly probable that a catastrophic nuclear exchange will occur and the Bikini Atoll test would have been one step toward that tragedy.  Fonda is much less complex.

We've seen these antics on college campuses, on May Day, during #BLM riots, and on private property, railroads and pipelines. The only question will be how long average Americans will put up with it.

As to mortal sin, the issue with remarried as to receiving Communion is not an assessment of subjective moral sin. Only God can make that assessment.  The issue is that the Church knows whether or not the individuals are married in the Church, considers adultery a serious (mortal) sin objectively, and therefore rightly denies Communion to those who are engaging in intimate relations.  Since the question is an objective, not subjective, one, the fact that “(n)ot every one is the same” is irrelevant and therefore NOT the issue.

Simple fact remains, if we treated Ho Chi Minh like the way we treated Tito of Yugoslavia, problems in that part of the world would have never happened. Both of these men were  politically identical. They were both nationalist first, communist second. But we gave Tito a break but branded Ho Chi Minh as a Red even although people of Vietnam often regarded China and Chinese as a greater threat. Ho Chi Minh won the national election that was respected by all Vietnamese outside of Viet-Catholics. But that election was rejected by the Eisenhower administration and supported by the Kennedy administration. Many historians agreed that if Ho Chi Minh was a white guy like Tito, US would have treated him differently and Yugoslavia being a strong neutral power with an anti-Soviet leaning despite of Tito being a communist, Vietnam could have played the same role in SE Asia against Red China.

Unfortunately, it is possible for a 14-18 year old to be subject to the draft at 18 with no vote in the matter.  Additionally, women should be subject to the draft (along with transgender folks).  I am against no draft.  Therefore, I think a 21 year age for drafting both men and women equally by population percentage is the best solution.  That political calculation would make it very hard for chicken hawk politicians as you mention above (let's add Dick Cheney to your list also) to send our young citizens off to war.

US since it's formation with the 13 Original Colonies does not endorse or enshrine in Law any aspect of multiculturalism or multinationalism. US, like many countries in Europe, Japan, China, Russia,  are a 'melting pot' and any newcomers need to accommodate themselves to the dominant culture. In the US, the culture is based on European laws, values, the English language and the dominant religion of Christianity. Only a few countries in the world adopt the bizarre State-mandated and State enforced  policy of multiculturalism and multinationalism where every culture, no matter how misogynist is considered equal. As PM Trudeau said, Canada is the first post national state that stands for nothing. I would wish no country in the world a worse outcome such as to be described by Trudeau, being post national and standing for nothing.

""""Science is our only objective method to find out and know factually. If wrong, admits its mistakes...""""  Do you not see the problem with your line of thinking in those two sentences?  You can thank the church that science exists, at all, because without a concept of an immutable God during the """"dark ages"""", the highest science one might achieve is engineering.

Remember that Jan Smuts lost his """"safe"""" UP seat in the 1948 elections. I support the DA position that a majority of MP's should be beholden to their CONSTITUENCIES rather than to the party, but I nevertheless feel that the 75/25 split will certainly be outdated if the Motion-of-no-Confidence in Zuma SUCCEEDS this time around and the ANC splits between pro-Zuma and anti-Zuma factions etc, etc. If we now have elections this year there should not only be a strong drive to implement mixed constituency-based and list-based MP's in future elections, but the number of ministeries should also be constitutionally limited to 25 to 30 ministeries.

1,"Making oneself a painted target for every low-life in viewing distance is hardly a way to keep oneself safe, just like flashing a fat wad of cash around probably isn't a good idea either. One can be legally right and still wind up dead or badly injured. Life isn't always fair, but if you use a little common sense you increase the odds of avoiding bad outcomes. Why is that so hard for some to comprehend? Encouraging women and girls to be blissfully stupid is a strange way to show you have the """"best interests"""" of them in mind. Not only does it increase their chances of being accosted or worse, but if a trial does occur their attire and/or consumption of drugs&alcohol will certainly be a point of interest. Encouraging irresponsible behavior, as Nelson is unwittingly doing, actually makes it worse for those women who practice responsible behavior to receive justice when they are assaulted. There may indeed be a """"rape culture"""" here, but equally there is an """"idiocy culture"""" as well.

( Spell check does not recognize it.)  I propose no argument about whether the word is grammatical; I simply find it to be an ugly and a clumsy word. It, and all derivatives of impact, have been so overused, misused, and abused, that they have become extremely annoying and nearly meaningless. Next up-the word that has the misfortune of becoming too trendy- icon!

0,"There are many similarities between apartheid in S Africa and the First Nations in Canada. There is no one """"Nation"""" that the government deals with. It deals with hundreds of different tribes, just like S Africa, all of which have a history of conflict with each other on some level, and who bicker constantly. No-one speaks for First Nations, so very little can be accomplished as far as policy is concerned. Secondly, they are separated physically from mainstream society on reserves, very like the """"homelands"""". Third, their members are determined by race and genetics. """"Pure-blooded"""" members are given indigenous status, but mixed races are not accepted if only a quarter or less of the genes are indigenous. More indigenous people are in jail than non-indigenous. The similarities with apartheid, when one comes to think about it, are very striking if you come from outside Canada, as I did many years ago.  Yet Canadians who were born here seem to accept all this as """"normal"""". Strange.

If the president has them deported this does not constitute an """"attack"""" on anyone. He is merely doing what he has taken an oath to do--uphold the law.  The church should not be involved in breaking legitimate laws that do not constitute a grave injustice. Is this Bishop telling us its O.K. to break the legitimate laws of Caesar. This is not consistent with the teaching of the Church. If a Bishop does such a thing he should do so with the approval of Rome or at least do it based on a unanimous consensus of his fellow Bishops in America.  Why these Bishops are not being arrested I do not understand. The Bishop is breaking the principle that actions of this sort are based on """"prudential"""" decisions and therefore should be carried out by the laity.

Our society does not have a clue about respecting authority.  Now they play cat and mouse with police officers and when bad things happen they blame those who put their life in harms way to help prevent a chaotic society.  Imagine what it would look like on the street if all police officers were told to stand down when engaging any African American regardless if they obey orders or not.  Don't think it would go very well for the police officers.  Get a clue people.  Respect authority and don't play cat and mouse.

0,"Marijuana is less harmful to human health, than the cigarettes, which is widely used and there is no ban on it. Marijuana reduces stress and aggression level, leading to less crime and its medical value and favorable effects on the health are scientifically proven. The author also should have in consideration that if we have marijuana use legalized, its market will be transparent, which is surely better than illegal sales of this drug. In these cases, the young and adult will have less interest in more harmful drugs. Hence, there is no need to have ban on marijuana sales and use, as marijuana cannot cause problems bigger than the legalized and widespread cigarettes do.

The politicians are looking at Muslim birth rates that are 50% higher than non-Muslims, and have determined that future chances of being (re)-elected without Muslim support are slim.  For our existing politicians, it is always about being (re)-elected. The development of polarized anti-immigration political movements in Europe and America followed the same pattern of conduct from establishment politicians. Many domestic voters are looking for vision, not voting bloc pandering, and it is very sad where that search ends up taking them.

0,"Greenhouse gas emissions should be attributed to the countries that actually make them.  Not the countries that provide the raw materials.  we should also use a net emissions model I which the emissions consuming value of our vast forests are added into the equation.  It's true that Ontario power generation was badly managed and suffered from political interference but the whole """"green energy"""" philosophy is flawed.  Assuming that we actually need these programs (which I'm not sure we do) they will only truly help reduce total world emissions if the 2 or 3 major emitters (china, India, USA) reduce their emissions.  Clearly this isn't going to happen anytime soon so why the heck are we imposing hugely onerous taxes on our citizens for no benefit?  Emissions per capita is not a valid way to measure climate impact.  It's kind of like when the used car salesman tells you the car is only $50/week.  Breaking the numbers down doesn't make the total smaller.

0,"Referencing Trump to the rise of historical brutal leaders has faded. It is time for a serious reflection of personality, policy and process in a more detailed, dispassionate, and public way. This is especially true as the Trump camp - leadership, coterie, and followship- seem to focus as it narrows and the supposed constitutional, institutional, public information, legal & ethical protections seem on the one hand incapable or unwilling to contain """"trumpism"""" or, on the other, sychophantically pandering. Trump is ranting to his base over the heads and around all of these.  His is a dwindling core, yes, but it is tightening a rabid remnant that is still surprisingly large (with a still significant fringe of the wavering tolerant). He has no allegiance to fact, truth, decency, logic, law, staff, constitution, empathy, commitment, etc. His only goal is to consolidate and incite his remnant into a human weapon that renders constraints impotent and to sew disorder for his ends.

Some of those costs are tax deductible as well, an advantage you won't see reflected in your rent payments. The bottom line is, you have to pay to live somewhere.

You make it sound like it was there from all eternity!  This does raise an interesting question. You, or others, might like to comment:  When Jesus asked the disciples at the Passover supper to 'take and eat' the matzoh, and to 'take and drink' the wine, was he 'present' in two different ways?? Was it a 'transubstantiation' of the passover bread and wine? After all, he had not died yet.  He was telling the disciples HOW to remember him and his death, for later on, after his resurrection. And gave us a means to share 'communion' with his sacrifice, for later use.

The Khadr family is one of traitors and cowards, they fought against Canada with the likes of rabid dogs in the Taliban - Khadr owes his life to the mercy of US troops.

Any Canadian who sympathizes with Khadr is a disgrace to Canada - sympathy with traitors and cowards who fought alongside the Taliban. Have you no shame?

Other than the environmental impact, more people die per capita in the US in traffic accidents. If you normalize with car ownership, then the death rates in Canada and the USA are same.  In other words, the USA has more cars and more car accidents. Canada uses more public transport, and less overall accidents (trains and buses rarely have drunken drivers, for example).

For over seven years, Wolbachia-infected Aedes males releases have been taking place in Columbia, Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, southern China, California, and Florida. And safety tests prior to these releases were only carried out on: spiders, spider eggs, soil samples, plant leaves, plant roots, earthworms, and millipedes (in Australia).  Wolbachia is a bacteria and reproductive parasite. There are many types. But the worrisome fact is that many aquatic species (such as copepods) and birds feed preferentially on the Aedes genus of mosquitoes (including their eggs and larvae).

Since nuclear destruction is something that no one is willing to subject his side to, the nuclear deterrent is prevents the real wars in which thousands die from smaller weapons.

Every country, and Canada most certainly, must have a large and immediately deployable nuclear arsenal.  Are you worried about so-called madmen?  Don't be.  Since they too want to survive, the chances of them using their nukes to attack is nil.  Rather, worry about the nuke-free vacuum left for overly rational creeps from the Big Three powers to project their might.  Dr. Strangelove was the ultimate pro-nuke, anti-war movie.

He told me a lot of things AFTER he quit crabbing and I was thankful that he didn't tell me those things BEFORE because I never would have allowed him to go. (Ha! Like a wife can tell a CRABBER not to do anything!) These men are the toughest men I have ever met. They take a lot of abuse to put food on the table for their families. These guys paid the ultimate price and now they are in the arms of Jesus. With great respect, RIP

If it can help some people get on and stay on a least a low rung of the ladder of interior life, then it's a good.  If it leads to a tasty and full feeling, it's unlikely good, and with repeated applications of other forms of trendy spirituality it can actually lead to a coarsening to interior and supernatural matters. One may even begin to doubt one's role and one's community effect in the plan of redemption.  If it  helps some people develop a daily and lively conversation with God, an active search for Him, and an eager use of the means that God gives us to know Him and love Him, then it would be a good thing.

I don't see this as the business of anybody outside the martial unit and medical personnel. Maybe a couple has had three children of one sex and now want to make sure they have a child of the other sex. I know a family where this was exactly the case: the mother had a boy, a 2nd boy, a 3rd boy and the mother wanted a girl. If abortion isn't wrong then there is nothing wrong with sex being one of the reasons women undergo them.

That is why it is so severe.   It was not created for people engaged in dangerous armed political protest.   There really are no laws that have been created to cover these kinds of acts, so the government has to use what is available under the law to prosecute.  Here is a link to a chart showing the sentencing guidelines for this law:  http://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Chart-924c-gun-MMs-NW.pdf  It is much like how the Hammond family was prosecuted under the Federal Anti terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.

On the streets unhoused people face prolonged exposure to inclement weather; lack the ability to eat nutritionally; are exposed to high risk of injury and illness; lack the ability to get quality health care; are depressed and anxiety-ridden; are on guard all the time when it comes to dealing with police; are subject to homeless predators who engage in theft and assault as well as to housed people who commit hate crimes.  People who are homeless, especially women, youth, LGBTQ folks, people with disabilities, and people of color are highly vulnerable to victimization by others, those housed and unhoused.

There is now only one Pediatric Neurologist in Eugene  and when he is gone, there is no one available to care for your child and lives are put at risk.   Many of the people now covered are because of more reaching medicare age and less are now covered by employers.   At a cost of billions to the US tax payers,  small businesses and working families and the cost of inferior health care, maybe a few more Americans are covered because of ACA.   I am confident,  we are going to have an overwhelmingly more cost effective plan and better coverage once ACA is repealed.

0,"Hugh, you, the fundamentalists, and the belligerent atheists all need to set aside these vulgar and cliched and distorted conceptions of God if we are going to get anywhere. There actually is a long tradition of Christian philosophy and theology that takes the question of God seriously. God is not a cloud being. Actually God is not a being at all, not an object you will come across in space and time. Here are some serious starting points. God is the source and fulness of being, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent. All things depend on God for every moment of their existence. God is beyond our comprehension and yet closer to us than we are to ourselves. A good introduction to serious thinking about God in this tradition is David Bentley Hart's The Experience of God. For a more poetic and personal intro, try My Bright Abyss by Christian Wiman. The experiences to which you were subjected as a child and as an adult--and I can say this unequivocally--do not represent this God.

Changing our electoral system on the whim of a drama teacher would have only benefited wackos who think Canadian citizens are surfs, along with those like Elizabeth May who, on her best of days, cannot convince enough people to elect more than one member of her National Party to Parliament.  I underline, one.

0,"a truly terrible day for hawaii if she gets elected.  can't or won't hold on to a position, couldn't straighten on the rail when she was on the board.  time for another party (or two)  in hawaii to offset the abuse the ruling party has inflicted on us over decades. unfortunately most voters never show up and many of those who do vote as they are told to by their mommies and daddies and union leaders.

1,"Oh Groanin, another lapdog, MAGAphant post.  Hmmmmm.  Interesting your reference to urinals and shaking things.  Just like the baby-in-chief, are you also obsessed with male parts?  Hilarious.  By the way, moron, if these meetings were really nothing, why did they stay hidden for so long?  Like this whole Russia thing, if nothing's there, the baby-in-chief should move on, do his job and ignore it.  However, sane people (not you MAGAphants) pretty much have concluded that """"where there's smoke, there's fire.""""  When someone acts guilty, they usually are.  At least that's what Fox and you Fox news lapdogs said during the campaign about Hillary (and I actually agreed with that point).  Please please post a response.  It's been a slow morning.

0,"The Founders did not consider a constitutional republic, incorporating as it does, the lawful means to change the gubmit and address and adjudicate grievances, as capable of becoming despotic and recognized no right to rebel against the Union, considering taking up arms against it treason. That is why Shay's Rebellion, the Whiskey Rebellion and Southern secession were put down by force of arms, and why there has never been a successful legal defense of treason using the Second Amendment as a defense. The Declaration of Independence is a political, not legal, document and is not used in courts of law. The histrionic political fringe right has always used despotism and tyranny in careless and meaningless ways, and grumbled  and fantasized about an armed revolt, sometimes drawing up utterly meaningless writs and proclamations, but the question of any imagined """"right"""" to take up arms against the federal gubmit has been long ago conclusively settled.

0,"You're right. We should let her go because it's the media's fault. She passed the background check, though. Ya gotta love those things. In fact, her lawyer said she's no threat because she doesn't have a criminal record. Yeah, and neither did Ted Bundy at one point. See how life works, ED?
