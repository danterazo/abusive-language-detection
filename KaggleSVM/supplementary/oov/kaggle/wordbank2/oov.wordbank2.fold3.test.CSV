1,"Donald Trump is spending this morning of his vacation lamenting the removal of various monuments to treason in defense of slavery: One thing I’ve been surprised by during this slow motion car crash into a raging dumpster fire is the sheer depth of Trump’s stupidity and ignorance. You could tell during Tuesday’s press conference that he thought he had come up with a new and especially powerful argument when he lectured the reporters about the previously unappreciated fact — no doubt just relayed to him by an advisor in the previous day or two — that Washington and Jefferson owned slaves (wait until he finds out that Jefferson liked to rape some of his). On top of everything else, he’s just really really dumb — and of course he remains blissfully unaware of this.

Logic is as logic does..  What has come to light recently though is a surfacing problem with the distraction of the Internet. What is lost in working with digital systems and the Internet can be made up with pen & paper or just simply the act of reading a book or manual... undistracted concentration.  """"Deep Thinking"""" is important to all young'uns & oldsters and in today's love affair with all things digital is seems that 'deep' focussed analytical thinking seems to be going by the boards in today's society. Apparently it could very likely be caused by society's obsession with digital devices. This book that speaks to the problem of the 'big distraction' from digital devices...

0,"Aaronavilla, you say “Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon (rushed the race-motivated muslim ban EO that was shot down by the courts for being unconstitutional within a week).”  From where did you get your information?  Oh, wait, I know, it was from a CNN report.  Great source. It is your opinion that they rushed the EO and that it is a race-motivated Muslim ban.  Let me correct what I just wrote. I do not believe it is your opinion; I believe you simply are parroting what the anti-Trump media says.  It may interest you to know the EO was not shot down by the courts for being unconstitutional. The court’s ruling applies only to immigrants who were already in the U.S. or on their way here when Trump signed the EO.  The ruling does not affect other aspects of the EO and does nothing for the thousands of refugees overseas from several terror-prone countries with coincidentally have Muslim majorities.  The legal battles are not over and I believe Trump’s ultimately prevail.   More to follow.

0,"Clarification: The President politicized Mrs. Johnson when, asked about the government's silence on the Niger ambush, he chose to focus on his phone call to her. He continued to debase the office of the presidency when he sent his Chief of Staff out to parade the moral authority of his son's death. Kelly then went on to confirm the President's phone call and debase the family. At the same time, he stated that military enlistees are better people than other Americans.  (Note: Nothin' in there about Democrats.)

0,"Actually I did provide one idea that would not infringe on anyone's rights and would be very low cost. Apolitical, age-appropriate, gun safety education in schools much as we offer sex ed, Mr. Yuck, fire safety, swimming classes, etc because those involve common risks in our communities about which children may not receive instruction in at home.  Intellectually the burden is on the person claiming a given restriction is needed, ie """"something must be done!"""" to: a) support that claim with evidence, and, b) provide a detailed proposed solution that can actually address that identified problem, also with evidence.  And you continue to tout the canard that the CDC is """"prevented from researching gun violence."""" It isn't. It tracks """"gun violence"""" via its WISQARS data, as do DOJ, BJS, and a host of other Fed, state, local and private orgs. There is a plethora of research available.  And the Orlando shooter, like most, wasn't -on- the watch list and -passed- multiple background checks.

0,"After over 3 decades during which Red Tory and centrist conservatives, on the one hand, and the social and Darwinist reactionaries, on the other, have fought each other, the Federal Conservative Party is united by a common desire to defeat the Liberals and NDP (and little else).  Thus, lacking any common positive motivation or purpose, many Party activists are prone to attraction to a brash, egotistical, media savvy self-promoter despite his seriously disqualifying factors.  The GOP, having become an even more dysfunctional Party, became pray to Trump, the archetypical outsider demagogue.  While O'Leary differs from Trump on many matters of opinion, style and belief, he shares with Trump the image of the bigger-than-life outsider and loner - and the Conservative Party now risks falling under his sway.  History shows that charismatic demagogues and the movements they lead rise to heights and fall quickly to oblivion in times of anxiety.  The risk to the Conservative Party is obvious.

0,"Choon et.al. I get that you are all feeling that you got the short stick when it came to dealing with the Mayor's office in the past. I will tell you there are many friends of mine that feel the same way...they got shafted to the side after Caldwell got elected and, well, feelings are still pretty hurt by that.  And I will even give you the fact that in his treatment of those with the short stick, he didn't have a good bedside manner when doing it. I know how that feels...I've been there too.  But as a citizen participant, as you say Choon, in the Hale, I will also tell you that this is what happens. Now you can lick your wounds and fight for the guy against the current Mayor to prove a point to the guy currently sitting there.  But don't fight for the other guy based on just saying the one in office now is a bum and he should be thrown out because, again, you were on the short end of the stick. Convince me that the other guy - the one you are supporting - is a better leader.

"
0,"The proof is in the pudding. But you are making the mistake of assuming you understand Marx by political projects in his name. Capital is analysis of capitalism's general features, in the tradition of Smith and Riccardo (and incidentally, highly critical of Utopian socialism),  not a blueprint for an alternative society. Its analysis had largely been borne out by reality. Take the time to read what Marx wrote, rather than what politicians and revolutionaries invoke, and you will see for yourself.

0,"The pope is engaging in a bad politics when he uses this expression (in reference to Trump): """"A person who thinks only of building walls""""  It's sad that we have a pope that uses such clever overstatement.

"
0,"What a relief!--a moment of humor - and truth.  Thank you Mr. McDaniel.  Many Americans weren't prepared for Donald Trump, and now are in a state of shock and disbelief--not knowing how to confront this disaster. Our system of government was set up to promote debate and power sharing--that's why we have 3 branches of government and Congress has two chambers.  These were to provide checks and balances that would prevent any one person or group from dominating.  This system has never faced such a crisis--but it's been slowly developing for decades.  We had gone on automatic cruise control and suddenly our car has broken down.  Let me not analyze what happened and why right now--but let's remember that each one of us has a bit of power and together we can find the way, that God has solutions if we're willing to face this as a spiritual challenge and are willing to grow.  And that front-line humor is the first thing that keeps soldiers alive and going.
"
0,"(Part 2)  Trump mocks the disabled, attacks minorities and ridicules women. He offers not so much a program or a policy, but simply himself, the Great White Savior: “Believe Me! Trust Me! You don’t even want to know how I’ll do it! I’m great! You’ll be great again because I’m great!” Trump shows little understanding of how democratic institutions actually work and he demonstrates no inclination to work within them. Of course he’s a fascist.  However, although Trump is a fascist, the United States in 2016 is not Germany in the 1930s.  Our institutions are stronger, our democracy more secure.  I think the United States would survive a Trump presidency, but given Trump's utter contempt for our system and institutions of government, his presidency would constitute the most serious test of constitutional government since the Civil War.

They have had years to figure out how to repeal and replace.  For that they do have a serious thrashing coming in next years elections. It will be new faces  kicking out RINO's and replacing them with Revolutionary  Republicans and Independents, not Democrats. People associate them only  with  failure and obstruction.

0,"(Part one of two)  I guess my problem is that I was in the seminary during the civil rights movement of the 1960s . . . this had nothing to do with politics.—Pat Perriello and by that standard, after seven years in the seminary (no ordination) I left the seminary in 1959.

0,"Although I am a Democrat, Pierce's positions had me nodding my head throughout much of this article. Both parties are trending towards their most extreme, vocal factions, polarizing the nation and making meaningful bipartisan collaboration increasingly difficult.  We need a more moderate GOP as well as a more moderate Democratic Party, and I would have considered voting for a moderate Republican gubernatorial candidate as an alternative to the too-far-left Kate Brown, right up until the point where Pierce backed Trump. This proves to me that Pierce is a moderate in name only, and that his values are too far from mine to merit serious consideration.
"
0,"Claim that the deficit is going to be over $20 billion and then come in at 17 billion. Oh look we are good. Oldest trick in the world.  Canada's performance mostly came in oil and gas, mostly recovering from the Alberta fires of last year which knocked out significant production. Also benefiting from strong US growth. Neither Trudeau or Trump have done much to help their respective  economies.

0,"(2) I am sure you are aware the Taxpayers have soundly defeated every tax measure and increase this City and County have put forth in the last 10 years, and this latest statement is not going to help your cause. The private/homeschooling movement is clearly gaining momentum (our private school has a waiting list of at least 100 kids) and with the incoming Secretary of Education that is surely to be confirmed this momentum is only going increase.  Being a local homeowner, property taxpayer, and having three home/private schooled young boys who are getting ready enter high school has sparked my interest in 4J policies and philosophies.  I would plead with you to strongly reconsider this issue.

Into the 50s progressive was a synonym for communist, and a """"progressive person"""" was a trusted fellow traveler but in a position where s/he couldn't be an open, card-carrying member of the Party.  Liberal became the substitute for use in polite company during the Cold War years until failed liberal policies made liberal a pejorative as well.   The government schools had done a good enough job of revising and air-brushing history that by the 90s it was felt safe to go back to the term progressive.   Some of us do know history and know that you've exposed yourself as either ignorant or a liar, but I'm confident you just think of yourself as """"educated.""""

From one of them: https://consortiumnews.com/2017/04/08/where-was-cias-pompeo-on-syria/  Before the photo was released on Friday, a source told me that Pompeo had personally briefed Trump on April 6 about the CIA’s belief that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was likely not responsible for the lethal poison-gas incident in northern Syria two days earlier — and thus Pompeo was excluded from the larger meeting as Trump reached a contrary decision.  Point is one should always take what is in the news with a grain of salt and not always assume something is the true because it is in the main stream press.

The real problem is, while we all agree that the minimum wage should be raised, both the why as well as the way in which it is being done by Wynnee the Pooh and her Liberal buddies.  The Liberals are doing this solely to buy votes in the next provincial election and as such have given little thought to the business ramifications of the increase.  It takes time to adjust for the extra payroll taxes, pension payments, benefits, etc. that are over and above the actual wage increase and to understand how these increased costs of doing business will impact individual businesses.

This needs to be rebuilt.  The poor condition of the road creates more noise as vehicles hit the breaks in the asphalt.  This also causes more wear on the vehicles.  The remaining gravel road out to Kantishna badly needs to be brought up to 21st century standards.  When the road construction first began in the 1920s those builders did not use the safety standards that we use today.  The road is dangerous. The landslides could wipe out a bus full of tourists.  The one in 2013 was particularly bad.  If it had occurred earlier in the year it could have sent a bus full of people down the hill and killed them all.  Improving the road makes it better for wildlife and visitors.  Less dust.  Less noise. Less equipment.  Less chemicals imported from China- and dumped on the road- to control dust.

So in fairness to the folks out there who still support Trump, I'll tip my hat to this latest move. I hope they in turn will start evaluating this guy's performance a little more objectively, and if he doesn't begin """"behaving like a mature, honest, thoughtful person who stops lashing out at anyone who criticizes him, and who puts the best interest of the country and all its people ahead of a narrow, ego gratifying agenda . . ."""" then I hope they step up, do their patriotic duty, and tell him to resign.

0,"Canada is not a leader in disability rights. It actually has engaged in serious human right abuses and criminal activity against the disabled. It has at times plotted the exploitation and or extermination of some disabled children as a protocol of government medicine and human resource management. The BC NDP in the 1970's routinely plotted to undermine the care of children with heart disease.  The government hated these kids.  Their stated end goal, not for public consumption of course, was simple murder.  Don't worry the RCMP protect the pedophile politicians whom murdering for the benefit of Canada was  just politics and justifiable.  I know firsthand.  I was a guinea pig and threatened with murder. Canada views disabled children this way:  First they are children with no inalienable rights and second they are disabled and thus eugenics laws can be used to compel the disabled into Nazis like experiments. Cure or death the government doesn't care you are a resource for exploitation.

The new license increase was intended so all GF money could be cut and it would be once again self funded.  The last conversation I had with leadership, they where expecting to loose all GF money withing the next couple years.  The new license and tag fee increase, along with a bounty of Pittman-Robertson Federal money (generated from a tax on sporting goods) will more than make up for loosing all GF money.  There may be a few small things that are not eligible for License or PR money but I stand by my statement that Wildlife Division is largely user funded.

These ignorant parents do nothing but put their children and others a risk. The naturopath and homeopath movements have done more harm that good. I don't know why they are licensed to practise. There is no evidence that any homeopathic remedy works yet people spend millions of dollars a year on useless products. ColdFX and echinacea are two good examples of products that are not backed up by any legitimate scientific study that shows they do anything. Belief in the harmful effects of vaccines, astrology, Sasquatch, Noah's ark, ghosts, psychics and many other concepts are just more evidence of how society is dumbing down.

And, since the 80s an army of talking heads at right wing institutes have worked tirelessly to make “liberal elite” an all purpose slur against anyone who disagrees with them.  The hypocrisy of pompous asses who never met a political theory, polysyllabic word or pseudo-academic title they didn’t like takes hypocrisy to brand new highs.  It’s true that PC blowhards continue to plague academia, but for at least 20 years Republicans have fielded by far the biggest army of bullies and professional victims.  Despite winning 2 elections in 16 years with fewer votes than their opponents, they even continue to whine that the system is rigged against them.  Consider for one minute what Trump and his supporters, including Putin, would be saying if Clinton had won with even one less vote than Trump and the immensity of that crock becomes obvious.

You only know what the media has told you and they hate Trump because he refuses to allow the media to control the national dialog as they have become accustomed to doing.  In reality, it is not one person who controls the nuclear arsenal.  Yes, the President has to say yes, unless removed from the scene by death or circumstance, but many many others are involved in the decision to launch.  The military has primary allegiance to the nation and its constitution - not the President.  If any President were to go insane and order a launch of American nuclear missiles without true need, it would be the obligation of the American military to refuse the order.  Just as lowly privates have a duty to refuse to massacre civilians despite orders to do so, the military is obliged to prevent needless pointless civilian death.

0,"Couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Fennimore. While of course all information is subjectively perceived, in law processing it is more objective- meant to offset that inherent subjectivity--thus there is an actual framework consisting of statutes and case law on which to rely and refer. Legal minds are trained to analyze the same and come to conclusions based upon the law and the intent behind it, not on how they personally feel on a particular subject.  Have you studied the law, especially Constitutional law? Have you studied the development of Law? Clearly, you have not, otherwise you'd have an understanding of what separation of church and state actually means.  As to values--yes, they play a part.  But that part is to respect the values of everyone in the country, not just one group.  You can vote however your conscience tells to vote, as can I. But neither of us can make laws that infringe on the other's constitutional rights-w/a few exceptions-nor should we be allowed to.

John Elway has also brought in Garett Bolles, a first-round draft pick at left tackle. Bolles, from the Land of Mormons, seems in keeping with the brutish line Denver wants to foster. Isaiah McKenzie and DeAngelo Henderson, two other rookies, seem to have plenty of juice, as a kick returner and as a runner, respectively. Jamaal Charles, a forgotten Pro Bowl reclamation, could lend a hand by striking fear into the hearts of Denver foes when he has the ball. So, with all the additions, it hardly seems like it's asking too much for Siemian to step up and show some spunk. He has a good arm and he stays cool under pressure. But after going 4-6 in his last ten starts, it's time for Siemian to assert himself and prove that he is a bona fide quarterback. Until then, he'll live in the shadows of doubt.

Sooner or later, Trump's kids, the VP's of Trump Operation will be facing a grilling.  Reminds of Alaska politics.  Yep, it takes a genius to transfer your tax burden to someone else.

0,"This is great. Let capitalism prove whether or not it works. I think it can. Fewer administrators, less red tape. Labor costs per individual will rise, but that can even out by running the plant more efficiently and with the savings at the top. Mt. McKinley as it was run was not the model of efficiency nor quality. There is a lot of room for improvement, and if the businessman who bought it believes he can make it work, great! For those who are upset the state sold it for less than its assessed value; suppose the state had held onto it one more year, and sold it for the assessed value, 100,000 more than what it sold it for. Well, it loses 100,000 per year. So the state would have come out even by holding it another year and getting the assessed value.  If they could have sold it for that.  If losing most of the management staff didn't cause further losses.  If, if, if. As it is, the negative asset is no longer in state hands, and freed of red tape, may actually get to grow.

Changing a bill passed by a duly elected government who more or less campaigned on it clearly demonstrates everything that is wrong with that house.  If we aren't careful with this one, we run the risk of degenerating into US style politics, where one house deadlocks the other.  We don't need a repeat of the woes suffered by them when the senate blocked an increase to the debt ceiling.  We should either eliminate this costly and wasteful exercise in non-democracy, or consider an elected senate.  And as an aside -- I believe unions are needed now more than at any time in the last 40 years.  Wage growth is flat, benefits are being cut, and CEOs are pocketing the majority of profit.

It was inevitable. Policy changed to prevent hunting within 1/4 mile of lake to appease anti-hunter crowd. Moose are thriving here. They are allowing more and more moose hunters every year. Get used to it.

I think most Canadians would be uneasy about foreign bankers having control over key infrastructure, especially if there aren't iron-clad safeguards in the contract against any sort of gouging or abusive practices.  Secondly, the novel nature of this funding approach clearly calls for close study by legislators from all parties, which means that these plans should be contained in a separate bill as opposed to being lumped into omnibus legislation. When in opposition, the Liberals used to always complain about Harper ramming legislation through the omnibus mechanism, and now here they are doing exactly what they criticized Trudeau's predecessor of doing.

It's one of those feel-good measures that politicians can pat themselves on the back for and point to for their  constituents as proof that they are doing something, but has no practical value whatsoever.  Education is absolutely essential for sure but I submit that getting people to switch to something safer, safer not safe,  is another good approach.  Sweden has done this and they now have the lowest smoking rate in the Western world.  The problem is in America the old guard will not tolerate anything that appears to condone a vice.   Just like they wouldn't let the government distribute hypodermic needles to stop the spread of AIDS because it """"condones heroin use"""" they won't let the government promote smokeless tobacco or Vapour  because it promotes a vice.

0,"I would completely disagree. The schedule favors the Rox easily in my opinion.  Milwaukee has one on the road today at Pittsburgh, four at home with the Cubs, three at home against Cincy and finish with three on the road in St. Louis. Cubs are obviously playing for the division and St. Louis is right behind Milwaukee for the wild card. That's seven against teams with a purpose unless St. Louis suddenly goes in the tank before next weekend. Plus, Milwaukee lost their number one starter for the season.  Rox have one today on the road in SF, four at SD and then six straight at home against Miami and LA. That's eleven games against teams with near nothing to play for and the final six at Coors. Only team with anything to play for may be LA trying to maintain the best record in the league for home field, but I have to think they'll be more concerned about lining up their rotation and resting their pen for the first round matchup with whoever comes out of the wild card game.

This is what happens when the biggest donations to political parties come from the real estate/development industry.

0,"""""In fact, cellulose fiber in the diet is beneficial.""""  Seemed counterintuitive to me.  But according to a recent San Francisco Food Column he's right.  Cellulose passes through your digestive system, aiding in the removal of waste from your body. This waste can include normal metabolic waste excreted in the bile, but may also include sugar and cholesterol if your blood levels are elevated. If you do not eat high-fiber food, your body continually reabsorbs excess sugar and cholesterol. Soluble fiber binds excess sugar and cholesterol in your intestines carrying them out of your body via solid waste. A high-fiber diet can improve heart and colon health and aid in weight loss. Cellulose is not digestible and serves no other purpose in your body aside from aiding in waste removal.  Cellulose is classified as """"generally regarded as safe,"""" or GRAS, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This means there is no scientific evidence that suggests cellulose may have any adverse effect.

Admittedly, Hitler wanted to exterminate those he was against by actually killing them, as the sociopath he truly was, as were his top- level followers  Obama, and his top-level followers did not wish to kill said same, or have them killed, but to make them, if not disappear completely, to make them a non-entity

0,"MA, I remain confused. Are not the """"old tax credits"""" now legally due and payable in cash (say over a 5 year period) to certain (small?) oil companies based on contracts previously made with the State of Alaska? It is my understanding, going forward, that future oil company production efforts will be encouraged by State tax credits based on actual production rather than on guaranteed cash payments from the State. Why shouldn't the free market be allowed to work and play out as it may, however painful that might be near-term to Alaska, its citizens and the oil companies?  Alaska holds the resources (cards). Let the oil companies come to us when market conditions change, rather than us go begging to them. We're holding the Aces, even if we can't lay them on the table right now.

0,"Wiliamson was probably emotionally detached from, and at the same time committed to, the path he had chosen/been recruited to. In much the same way that people like McBride (and others - think Church Square) carried out murder against innocent people so Williamson operated against his perceived enemy. His was to engage people win their confidence and then act against them whereas the other side crept up on people and killed them. If those responsible for the deaths of nightclub patrons and city pedestrians are now left alone..... Those to whom the victory is awarded get to write the history and make the requisite noises. Those relegated to the failed side fade away and quietly get on with their lives if that is allowed them. It benefits no-one to keep scratching the wounds on either side - in fact it inflames things all over again. Perhaps the book ought not to have been written.

0,"The argument against raising the minimum wage ignores the fact that government having intervened so much in the distribution of income in the economy already these past fifty years, has in so doing messed up price signalling to such an extent, that in fact no one can accurately predict the consequences. Who knows what anything is worth?  Once governments intervene as much as they have the markets ability to determine value is lost. Inevitably intervention leads to chaos and confusion. Imposing a minimum wage proves the case in point ... it signals to all that the market has been caused to fail. If the market was working there would be no need to intervene at all. Arguing for or against minimum wages is a manifestation of a battle long lost by proponents of market pricing.  Socialism has won ... for the time being. Though we all are poorer for it — except those employed by the cadres running the entire Rube Goldburg contraption.

However, that guy is all what the proponents have said.  Janovich showed some key blocks.  Sanders and DT kinda took the night off, but they'll be good.  Sunshine really made some big plays.  And, Siemian looked like he's taking command more so than just trying to survive out there.  This team stays healthy, they figure out what to do about Garcia, and the Broncos might have a pretty good offense.  About the only other adjustment is using Sloter as back up QB, 'cause Lynch is way out of place on that field.

0,"Motley, if a DA believes a rape has been committed, I believe that DA will be absolutely certain that the rape kit is processed.  I believe the untested rape kits come from situations where the identities are not really in question and the facts surrounding the incident do not support a rape charge.  As you know sexual intercourse is not illegal.  A rape kit tells whether sexual intercourse has occurred and via DNA the male involved.  But if a DA determines that circumstances do not support rape but rather consensual sex, the rape kit provides no useful information.  Of course, every rape kit where the male is unknown should be processed.  I doubt that the unprocessed kits fall into that category.  Too bad some investigative reporting has not occurred.

While your reference is from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hard left group, they were fairly accurate but did not point out political affiliation in great detail. Many other sources, including Wikipedia, did note political affiliation. KKK was formed and had three separate strong time frames. In the first two, they were exclusively democratic. In the third, they were almost entirely democratic with a few others, not affiliated with a party. The Dixiecrats were very strong with KKK support in the south until the 60's. When the Dixiecrats failed to have success in their bid for president, four of them switched party to become republicans and the hundreds of other remained with the democratic party. Strom Thurmond was their presidential nominee but was one of the four who switched and over time he moderated his views as they evolved. The same views that moderated and evolved for Robert Byrd.

But England was looking for an excuse as the Germans had the audacity to get involved in a naval Dreadnought race with England.

Note the standard response is do what the cops say and you won't be killed which completely ignores the adverse circumstances, fear, shock, and other factors that influence an individual's response when confronted by police.  Well, protests and calls for reform have led to nothing.  Now, with establishment lives on the line, I think we will finally see some serious consideration of what is wrong with police tactics.

Or, as Buckley put it in 1959, “There are no scientific grounds for assuming congenital Negro disabilities. The problem is not biological, but cultural and educational.”

The goyy made indexed pensions look good by underfunding the indexing account. Then when a deficit of $6 billion appeared, it was blamed on high cost. In fact there is no cost to indexing. Inflation increases interest rates thus providing funds with more dollars which compensate for decreased purchasing power. Some employers put that in their pocket.  In short, public or private, if you have a defined benefit pension plan, your pension plan is a  money maker for your employer.

0,"While it may be a given that a portion of the elderly have compromised hearing, a far greater threat to a clear understanding of the Word may also be attributable to the existential fact that because of the waning number of priestly vocations in this country, we have increasingly relied on the presence of foreign priests in our parishes.  A priest may be a priest regardless of country of origin, but a preacher does vary widely in the speaking talents necessary to make clear the Word of the Lord.  I dare say, many of our foreign born priests in so many of our parishes do not succeed in their avowed passion to make intelligible and compelling the sacred readings and their interpretation and application to our daily lives.  This failure, while not deliberate, is very much a concomitant of the fact that English is not their first language.  A diminishing quantity of priests has given rise to a diminishing quality of speakers.  Attention must be given to this growing deficit.

There is no support, beyond brain waves, for such a thing.

Pierre Trudeau who was originally a communist, then joined the NDP when he realized he couldn't get political traction under that banner.

For example, when women consider intimacy, they also consider where they are in their cycles, what intimacy will mean to their partners, and a whole host of other thoughts and emotions. Men, as far as I can tell, are not likely to be so reflective in the moment. And yet, every book I've read on moral theology deals with sex as if men and women experienced it in substantially identical ways. Even the underlying assumption of many comments here is that a married priesthood would mean married men, not married women. In the process of historical development, Catholic theology of sex is still at the training bra stage.

Put yourselves in this guys position, who wouldn't take a plea deal on something like this for time served versus going all in on the roulette wheel of justice in Lane county. Go do an analysis of all of the cases where the DA's office initially charges as a M11 and then after 60-180 days in jail with no bail (or extremely high bail) they are suddenly willing to drop the M11 crime and instead of doing everyday of 8+ years in prison they are happy to hang a felony on the guy and let him out with just the 3-6 months they stole his freedom from him.

There is more water in the air to fuel these deluge storms, creating the downpour, now over 52 inches. Another is sea level rise. The global average is 8 inches, but that's the average. The sea level rise in the Gulf of Mexico in the areas hit by Harvey is higher, """"a good foot,"""" according to Hansen.  This additional water vapor fuels the strength of the storm as well as contributes to the unprecedented rain, and the storm is larger and more powerful.  Much stronger, wetter storms on top of a foot of sea level rise in recent decades have created this particular climate catastrophe.

As more processors stand up and the supply chain starts being reliable, then the stores can demand suppliers process better on behalf of those customers. Also, as the market develops with competition, the stores and suppliers who lack business savvy will fall out of the market and only the most efficient competitors will remain, which will drive prices down to the minimum levels the market will bear. Particularly since the black market will always be driving the lower end of the price/quality spectrum.  If Rep.

Let's say you are single with no dependents, and you have a moderate income. Currently, you get to take the standard deduction ($6,350) and one personal exemption ($4,050). If you are 65 or older, you also get to take an additional standard deduction ($1,250). That adds to $10,400, or $11,650 if you're a senior citizen.  The Republican plan would replace all these provisions with a single deduction of $12,000 ($24,000 for married couples.) That's a 15% increase — except for seniors, who get a 3% increase.

The report further breaks down the incomes of the detained population by race, ethnicity, and gender. Additionally, the authors compare pre-incarceration incomes to the incomes of similarly aged non-incarcerated Americans.  While the report focuses on the incomes of people who were detained for their inability to meet bail, the authors recognize the scarcity of useful information about the jail populations in this country, so they also provide the pre-incarceration incomes of people in local jails generally in an appendix.

AETNA is the last insurance company standing that offers a plan to consumers by the ACA. AETNA has other plans including the one my family has been on for years. Alaska has been a state that the GOP governor's unlike some in other states have addressed helping the ACA instead of trying all they could do to make it fail. No doubt that the effort made by the medical facilities ( I saw my own with the big push to get people sign on to the ACA) and the expansion of medicaide in Alaska has helped to reduce costs to the rest of us since those who could not pay for medical care are now paying. Insurance company's in this state were prepared before the ACA was passed to start offering that coverage. This state with all the push to kill the ACA left Insurers in a situation that their planning could have been better. The fault of increasing the costs in AK, the politicians.

Also, more than 26,000 Colorado drivers were arrested in 2016 for drunk driving.  It sounds to me like the Denver Post should devote equal space to a series of news items on drunk driving and associated fatalities, which would have to be 3.2 times as much space devoted to this attack on legal marijuana to achieve parity based on the number of traffic fatalities incurred by type of intoxication.  https://www.criminallawdenver.com/preliminary-colorado-2016-dui-statistics/  Here are a couple other statistics:  An estimated 60 people died in 2016 in crashes because they weren't wearing seat-belts, and 50 more motorcyclists died in 2016 than in 2015.

It does not help our economy to have high immigration with no job creation - that is the path environmental disaster and economic disaster for the people (not the 1%).  Has your MP asked what your opinion is so they can take it to Ottawa which is how our democracy is supposed to work?

War Chief Joseph Brant of the Mohawk led a number of deadly raids during the war in the Mohawk River valley, massacring many defenseless settlers in their homes.  In retaliation for the murder of so many white settlers, the new American government organized the infamous Sullivan-Clinton military expedition, which attacked the 4 tribes that had allied themselves with the British.   Over 40 Indian Villages were destroyed in an act of revenge, and the Mohawks were then forced to flee to Canada for safety.  The Mohawks were never an admirable symbol or worthy of being the school's mascot, as many of stood against the creation of the United States.

It was in mint condition and one could smell remains of its new vehicle smell.  It is smooth and nimble in town, a delight off road, and the most fun vehicle we have ever driven.  A recent report showed it the leader globally for vehicle resale value in its 4th to 5th year with a typical loss of only 14% off original sticker price with to my amazement one of the Jeep models at 15 to 16%......go figure with all the bad reports on it contained in this article.  In fact, a Global News report a few months back advised buyers - based on 10 years of statistical evidence - that the single worst vehicle to ever buy was anything with a Chrysler, Dodge or Jeep nameplate......of course, top of the heap was anything called Toyota.

They are against anything that might slow or halt the sale of guns to anybody. If the NRA cared one bit about the carnage they are causing they would support background checks on all gun sales. They would stop blocking CDC research into gun violence in our country. They would not have a problem with waiting periods and they certainly would be in favor of banning the sales of guns to those on the terror watch list.

He proved to the State and defense departments that the Koreans were very willing to negotiate on their nuclear power plants.  Perhaps Obama needs to do the same if Trump wants another invasion. Maybe Carter could join him on that mission?  Militarily we have never been successful in war against Korea. When we occupied the Korea after WWII, their guerilla war leader, who had driven out the Japanese, also almost drove us out of Korea if it were not for the brilliant strategy and tactics of General MacArthur along with bad support by the Washington establishment.

So I understand the concerns about it not being posted, at all (seems to be the issue) but don't understand why it would be expected to be posted BEFORE the hearing.

Boyden has earned his place by chronicling consistently the First Nations' experience and shining an eloquent light where many would not have looked if not for his efforts. Doubtless there will be an ongoing chorus who question the authenticity of Boyden's work based on his """"lived experience"""" - or lack thereof - of being First Nations.

0,"I'm not sure we needed to push agenda's on gender and aboriginal issues here, but it was wise to promote environmental and labor issues. Why?  Because Canada supports higher labor and environmental standards and to do so costs money. When the US and Mexico have lower labor and environmental standards, that gives them a competitive advantage. So, it not only positively reflects on Canada's NAFTA bargaining position earning the support of the domestic population in Mexico and the US by seemingly advocating for them, if the US and Mexico do raise environmental or labor standards, it helps Canada compete for business within NAFTA and internationally. So, it's a win-win for Canada. I imagine the push for gender and aboriginal issues are really just for domestic reasons, and these concerns will be quickly traded off for concessions from Mexico and the US. That's how it works, push something unreasonable then trade it off against something unreasonable from the other parties. Bargaining 101.

Public toilets are available based on the physical sex of each individual, or in some cases facilities with limited access that have locks on the doors.   Why is this not perfectly acceptable? What of the rights of millions of people whose religious or personal beliefs reject the transgender life as sinful or immoral? Why insist everyone using what ever toilet that he or she wishes to use other than to force an issue that should be obvious in it's solution.

0,"Jesus did not advise excommunication.  I suppose you refer to Mt 18:17 where Jesus says treat them as you would a tax collector. But Jesus is talking to his disciples. In all things, the disciples are supposed to follow the Way of their Teacher. Notice that passage starts out with """"if your brother sins against you,"""" and concludes with """"forgive 70 x 7."""" So this is a passage about forgiveness. It is followed by the story of mercy where the servant fails to forgive. Disciples were servants of their Master -- those who do not show mercy and forgive are not worthy servants.  Also, do you recall that Jesus dined, not just with tax collectors, but also with Pharisees (Lk 7:36), with whom he disagreed. Jesus did not shun those he disagreed with. Instead he DINED with them.   So treat them like taxcollectors means - go dine with them.

0,"/facepalm at you confirming some of the key things I said.  If the bollards are too far apart then they will use a littler car and go between them.   The bigger vehicle is to deal with taking on the bollards not the building.  Two thieves generally aim for the door so they don't have to deal with clearing stuff.   If you take away the door completely they will deal with limited amounts of 'clearing stuff' to get at what they want.   They can and would 'create a hole' by ramming the side of the building and backing out or just leave the stolen hole maker in the building while they leave in another vehicle.    The I beam bollard you mention is very easy to get out of the ground with a push/pull and a semi decent chain or strap it's done.  You don't think the front door is the only door on these buildings do you?   Again as you described your bollard it's no more difficult to remove than a basketball backboard post.

0,"One thing is to unpack who will pay for what, and at what rates. When it comes to a basic service like electricity, the principle (or ideal) of provision according to household need and payment according to ability should be a key consideration with regards to distribution and cost recovery. This also applies to outstanding payments, as research has shown that commercial users constitute a substantial portion of unpaid bills - entities that should not be treated the same as poor households. Addressing poverty and inequality will not be served by treating all consumers as equal.  How the incumbent electricity system will transform, which objectives should be prioritised, how infrastructure is financed and democratically managed  - how 'public ownership' is given effect - needs to be the subject of concerted and inclusive social dialogue, feeding into sincere and transparent planning processes. So, not a simplistic """"substitute"""", but human rights recognised as more than a payment issue.

0,"CCB is a income-based, untaxed support for families which already offers that additional support to low-income vs. high-income families that is proposed.  At the lower income you get $533/month/child so for two kids that could be $1066/month.  That's already a decent amount of support.  Your proposal would get more low-income earning women back in the workforce but for the """"middle class"""" women you'd make the cost to re-entry higher. So more female retail workers and less female engineers would result because those women making about $70k can do the math. The drop in CCB and the daycare cost with no tax rebate means her net is about $14k/year (not including increased commuting costs/clothing etc..), But the retail worker will lose almost $2k in CCB but with free daycare can earn $30k so she's $28k ahead.

0,"Okay, let’s get serious. Over the last few years, we have seen one baseless police killing after another. Mostly, these killings occur because police are trained to act aggressively and place themselves into situations of immediate risk and thus make split second decisions which, as we see, often lead to needless death. Despite protests, nothing has been done to alter police tactics so as to be more life friendly. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary to fight fire with fire to produce change. I think probably many of us expected a war against police to break out. I expect it will continue until real attention is paid to change police tactics. Police do not have to be as aggressive as they are except in rare situations. The routine massive show of deadly force causes many unnecessary deaths,  When injustice becomes massive, eventually, the victims of the injustice fight back. We have seen that here. The best response would be to consider fixing the problem.

He won't blow up Turkey. But Trump will blow up the world.  Erdogan have made clear his views on the future of Turkey long before he was elected president, when he was mayor of Istanbul. He kept getting elected. He put is proposals on reforming the power of president and legislature into a national referendum. And won. It's called democracy. You have a problem with democracy?  One more thing: Erdogan survived a coup staged by his long time enemy assisted by the CIA. Yup, yet another American attempt to overthrow, a NATO ally at that. He is going to do something about it now.  I expect Erdogan to exit the American orbit and return Turkey into a true sovereign state. After all, what benefits have decades of being an American puppet brought? Forever wars around its borders.

Just half of them, 25% of eligible voters, chose the sexist, racist, buffoon trump while 27% of eligible voters chose Clinton. When the final tally is complete it is probable that Clinton will get 50%+or- of those votes cast while trump will get 47% with Stein and Johnson garnering the rest. Only four times in our history has the Electoral College vote gone to the loser of the popular vote. In modern times those two are Gore and Clinton. When it looked like Romney was going to win the popular vote but lose the electoral trump was very unhappy and began a twitter fest calling the system corrupt and rigged and encouraging people to march on Washington in protest. Romney of course lost both the popular and electoral vote but trump prematurely ejaculated his emotions into the election via twitter for all the world to see anyway. The system is """"rigged"""" unless my side wins right?

0,"I agree that colonial America had a horrible and cruel slavery bent.  Colonial America was an offshoot of Europe, and as we evolved as a society, America's views of slavery dramatically changed. I can see that statutes, monuments, etc. could be hurtful to  families of those who were slaves.  Slaves from Asia were brought to build the railroads but still AMTRAK is still there.  Immigrant families were detained at Ellis Island, and there is still a museum.  Abused children, survivors of domestic abuse, pro-lifers and survivors of abortion, anti-war citizens are all forced to pay taxes for things they don't support.  Europe is held in high regard and respected, although it is their very history of slavery that was brought to America.   History is there for us to study and learn from.  What are we left with when there is no history? So the 'Great Purge' has begun.  Today the monuments, tomorrow the books.  And then lastly history itself will be rewritten.

Even Jesse Jackson liked what Trump had to say.  Re: The PMI for mortgages. Trump reversed it because loans should not be given to people who cannot afford to service them. This is what caused the crash in 2007-08, with Pres. Clinton's Community Reinvestment Act.  The Texas law was remanded back to the lower courts by the SC. It didn't stop any challenge. Besides, the poor (and if you want to read that as only Blacks and Hispanics) also include plenty of white folks, BUT most of these people already receive some forms of assistance and they already have IDs.

No Christian church has done more good or more harm than the Catholic church has done in its history.

Christian churches have had periods of murder justified by claiming it was 'God's will'.    We're seeing the same arrogance and human self centeredness is some sects of the Muslim religion.   If you look at primitive cultures they also had spiritual lives, sometimes very brutal.  Churches have also saved live by providing food/shelter/medical care/amnesty and sanctuary to those who are persecuted or in need.

0,"Alaskan voters elect 60 legislators since the forming of our state's Constitution and every House and Senate election cycle.  However, since the Republicans have taken control of the Legislature (thirty-something years ago) the Speaker of the House and the Senate President ALWAYS drag their junior members into a back room and tell them how they're going to vote.  If they don't vote lock step, they're stripped of their committee chairmanships and forced out of the majority caucus.  The latest House member stripped of her teeny-weeny power is Reinhold.  What's more, Parnell made the sole decision not to allow legislators to vote on Medicaid expansion.  Neither the Speaker or the Senate President questioned Parnell's decision.  They did what their Republican Party told them to do.  So tell us once again, Voucher, how our legislative branch of  government works for the people when their own ability to vote on legislation is subverted by their so-called leaders.

A friend in another state who committed suicide did so not because of affluent or trophy lives, but grief over his mother's death that was not addressed. Even in """"affluent"""" LPS, my kids, between them, had ONE friend whose original mom and dad were married and in the home, and many of those single parent families struggled. Also keep in mind many, many teen suicides do not make the news. There's one from this week that is nearby, outside LPS, but unmentioned. A girl who sat next to my son in class committed suicide 3 years ago, and it was told to the students, but there was no press.

The Pope should never have allowed it to be on the agenda especially as it had been reaffirmed by one of his recent predecessors. Any Catholic who is divorced and remarried is deceiving himself if he thinks he is not committing adultery and thinks that adultery isn't a mortal sin. The 'settled' teaching going back to Apostolic times (1 Cor 11:27) is that one should not receive the Eucharist unworthily. The Church has consistently taught that this means not being in a state of grace or to put it another way in a state of mortal sin. Any Catholic who values his Faith would know this. If he doesn't then it is doubtful that he would even care whether he was in a state of sin or not. My standard for determining settled doctrine is what has been consistently taught by popes and councils down the centuries.

Just like for SOME Democrats that do the same type of thing from the other side.  But that's only SOME.  Heck, anyone that can't see that large swathes of Republicans thought (and still think) just the opposite about Trump than what you describe wasn't paying attention during the nomination.  More than half of the party was fighting Trump's nomination tooth and nail, not just voters but top party leaders all over the place.  Trump had the LEAST support from the party and it's members than any party nominee in modern history.  It just happens that D's ran someone with just as many problems (different problems, but big problems nonetheless).

0,"ME2 would get attention proportional to its population.  Just as in current battleground states, presidential candidates—advised by the nation’s most astute political strategists— would hew very closely to population in allocating campaign events.  When every voter counts equally, candidates campaign everywhere—big cities, medium-sized cities, and rural areas.  There is no evidence that they ignore rural areas or favor big cities in an election in which every vote is equal and the winner is the candidate receiving the most popular votes.  In current battleground states, not only is there no evidence that presidential candidates ignore rural areas or concentrate on big cities, it would have been preposterous for them to do so.  There is nothing special about a city vote compared to a rural vote in an election in which every vote is equal.  When every vote is equal, every vote is equally important toward winning.

0,"@JimJohnson: Where did  you get your """"completely unacceptable to 99.9%"""" statistic? Overall, racism is rising - again. It's still acceptable to a certain percentage (more than .01%) of all races.  A 2015 poll (Kaiser Family Foundation), shows that 49% of Americans believe that racism is a big problem. That's up from 2011, when only 28% believed racism was a problem. If it's a problem, then that means it's acceptable to others. Even if we were to go with your 99.9%, that leaves the various races still accepting racism.  Every race has its racists, who think it's both acceptable and justifiable. Do I think racism right? Not by any race toward another. However, right or wrong wasn't one of the questions asked by the poll. If it was asked, it wasn't reported.  So, Mr. Ernst's actions make a kind of sense. He's pointing out that racism still exists, even in 2016. At 49% who believe it a problem, he has the information to back him up.

0,"Nik Nanos takes rather a long time to describe how trends tend to revert to the mean over time.  It is true however that Justin Trudeau is a complex political figure whose needy desire to be personally liked, to always say the right thing and to be in the spotlight masks a not always judicious desire and capacity to wield the knife (example: dealings with Canada's Senators) and a too often lack of willingness to follow through with earlier commitments in the face of difficulties.  This profile fits well with the modus operandi of the Federal Liberals that customarily campaign for election from the left and govern from the centre right (never more so than over the past 3 years).  A leader with these traits (and the Party he/she leads) will experience wide swings as the public is drawn to and then put-off in cycles by such a leader.  We're just over the peak of the 'drawn to' phase at present with Trudeau and the Liberals.

But before this veto, other countries and regions in EU have threatened to veto, to complicate, to delay, to modify, to play politics.  It is perhaps for the better. A trade agreement with such a body as the EU, marred in infinite complications, weird contradictions, monetary failure, and lingering character of empire and fascism, is doom to fail in the end. The EU is a vassal of the U.S. but too proud to admit it. And now, too afraid to link up with another American vassal, Canada.  This is the curse of being a vassal.

The Charter and who didn't act, all three PM's didn't , are not the issue, although even Trudeau has changed his stance from the original justification. The key issue here is the belief or rather the government's stance that they felt they couldn't win. What else are they going to say ? Knowing this government it is highly unlikely they were ever going to fight this case. The point is we will never know, as the deal is secret, and we will never know what the lawyers advised because they will have been sworn to secrecy. So it becomes a face value issue. You believe they should have settled, fair enough as I said, however it should be just as fair for people to have an opposing view, without all the accusations that they are ignorant or anti-Charter. Everytime there is a settlement, we can disagree with the amount, without being against the law

Then, while one can select the Newest order, that brings up entire threads within which the newest comments nest and must be searched. One then has to come back repeatedly to see IF there are comments added since one last read. Really laborious and doesn't add a sense of ongoing conversation. I find myself somewhat reluctant to do all this to keep up even if I'm very interested in a topic.

0,"People are asking why Sessions doesn't do something.  I believe it is because he recused himself from all investigations related to the so-called collusion with Russia.  Since he recused himself (foolishly in my opinion), he is prevented by law from knowing anything about the so-called Russia matter.  He cannot give advice about it, comment on it, know anything about or receive any communication about it.  He cannot be involved in any way.  Since so many crazy things related to the election are conflated with the Russia thing, Sessions is pretty much prevented from doing anything.  Rosenstein is the person on which the Russia problem landed, but he punted to Mueller.

The Left's warnings about the abject destructiveness of the modern conservative movement have been ignored for more than a generation and the country is now paying a dear price for it.

Clark thinks cash for access is just fine, so long as they speed up the timeframe for declaring who is buying their attention. The fossil fuel industry has given markedly more to Clark and her Libs in BC than they've given to the Conservatives when they were in charge in Alberta - see the article in National Observer for evidence, if doubting this.

1,"The DSM is a socially construction. Diagnoses come and go as society changes. For example, homosexuality was removed as a mental illness in 1987 after gay rights activists protested. The total removal of homosexuality from the DSM was the result of a vote. Recently, sexual identity disorder(s) were reconfigured to eliminate stigma against trans persons. The reconfiguration came after consultation with transgender advocacy organizations. And a vote. Gender dysphoria continues to be a diagnosis only to facilitate insurance reimbursement for treatment. People who are not unhappy with being trans are not diagnosed as having a disorder, and people who have successfully transitioned from one gender to another no longer have a diagnosis. If the DSM had stable diagnostic categories, then it could be reasonably argued that the DSM is purely scientific. But the diagnostic categories historically have shifted in response to advocacy and political action, demonstrating its essential social nature.

In the past ADN news staff have reported that approximately 156 impoverished rural slum  threatened villages will need to be moved.  Each site will be a new location of welfare dependency.  These costs will be bourne by the State of Alaska and federal welfare transfer programs: e.g., special village government jobs, village police, village schools, village air strips, village power plants and power cost equalization payments, village communications hubs, etc.  From a financial perspective, if each village move costs about $150,000,000 to accomplish, then the cost to the State of Alaska to save important Alaskan BUSH village culture is only about $23.4 billion. THINK OF THE JOBS? THINK OF THE PLANNING? THINK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PUBLIC INTEREST LAWSUITS (e.g., PEBBLE MINE interests were stopped when the project development hurt the local environment)?

0,"Let me put it in terms that can be accessed more easily:  Everything needs to be ordered to the good that God had intended.  You're quite wrong about things being good or bad without reference to God.  God is the creator of all that is good; there is no good outside of Him.  If the poem Jabberwocky gave a father and son an instrument to spend some time with and to deepen their friendship, then that would be good fruit.  And this is a point for others here:  All actions should strive for their most perfect state, done well for love of God  A poem read alone & never discussed with friends is a lower state of perfection than one that is and which brings to light some good to dwell on or pray about later with God.   The second example is more perfect than the first.  So all things can be ordered to a higher good, when God's viewpoint is taken into consideration:  He's hoping we use the things of the world for the good, for things like deeper friendships, the building up of virtues.

If the City is going to subsidize the """"public health"""" needs of condo owners who can't afford to modernize, we many homeowners need public subsidies to do so as well.  For example, fire sprinklers for us, closer fire hydrants,  home emergency fire alarm systems.  Even security cams because single family homes get robbed more frequently than secured condo developments, and so, are at higher risk of arson.  In social fairness, the City Council must consider subsidies to private homeowners for comparable needs when considering subsidizing private condo owners.  We all pay the same taxes.  Paraphrasing Mufi's quote, """"the life of one homeowner is worth it.""""  I'm no different than the private condo owner, except I have the heavier individual burden of maintaining a home and yard.

I was address those non-Alaskans who are working many, many jobs in Alaska, yet live in another state.  Unfortunately a sales tax is not fair on several levels.  It isn't fair to tax basic necessities.  It isn't fair to tax the poorest households a greater percentage of household income.  It isn't fair to tax the higher costs of goods and service in rural Alaska when those same items cost much less in Anchorage and on the road belt.  I support the tax!

The retention study cited was seriously flawed in that it began during the deep recession at the end of the Bush presidency when most of us were happy to have and keep any job.  Secondly: Mr. Wang’s experience is typical for TFA teachers. Many use this two-year public service commitment to help their nation and strengthen their vitae. Education Week, Oct 4, 2011 reported that after five years, only 27.8% of the TFA teachers were still in teaching. TFA teachers are often viewed as well-intentioned and inexperienced. By the time they gain experience, they move on to their primary job, like Mr. Wang. Struggling schools can use beginning teachers, sure, I’ve never heard an administrator wish for a constant supply of well-intentioned beginning teachers with only 5 WEEKS of teaching preparation.

The data taken before, during and after adult use of recreational marijuana became legal is clearly indicating significant harm to others when a driver uses marijuana.

During the test period of about five years, drivers testing positive for active marijuana KILLED more bicyclists, pedestrians, passengers and other drivers than drivers using alcohol even though there were significantly fewer marijuana drivers.  We hypothesize that these drivers have impaired visual functions and do not actually see the person or other vehicle.  Or see them inaccurately.

0,"I have a difficult time determining exactly what I think on this issue re: female pastors/priests, Nora. On the one hand, women certainly appear perfectly capable of filling the role, better than men in some aspects of the job. On the other hand, there appear to be clear biblical restrictions against women teaching men in that setting.  The OT has an example of a woman who was the Judge of Israel (Deborah in Judges 4 and 5) at one point in their existence. There aren't any negative references to her ability to do the job. On the contrary, she seems to perform admirably in the role.  Are the NT injunctions against female pastors and overseers purely a remnant of a social restriction that is now redundant? Or do the still obvious personality differences between women and men indicate that we should still adhere to the biblical admonition? I don't know how to add it all up, Nora!

0,"Correct.  The serious violation of DACA through executive order is on Obama.

0,"Cutting the Office of Climate Change would be a false economy, a truly bone-headed idea.  Kind of like reducing the number of tax collectors to save the money spent on their salaries.  One of the proposed positions in the Office is an Energy Project Manager whose job will be to start energy and lighting retrofits of city buildings and facilities and to negotiate Energy Performance Savings Contracts.  This would not only reduce the carbon footprint of city-owned buildings, but significantly reduce the city’s electric bill.  This is not speculation.  Energy Star buildings throughout the state are estimated to have saved more than $20 million on their electric bills last year alone.  Those savings explain why 57% of the top Fortune 500 companies have sought the Energy Star rating for their facilities.

Maybe not a $15 million Waialae Kahala beachfront home or but definitely a decent a million dollar home/condo somewhere in Honolulu.

Now, imagine, for a moment, if you looked in the mirror and what you saw didn't jibe with the image of your gender that seems inherent? Or you were attracted to members of the same sex. Can you control that? The argument made by those opposed brings up the idea that a transgender person is going to flip back and forth between gender identities to gain some advantage or something. Do you, Richard, ever change your gender identity to benefit yourself? No. Transgenders are not people who are confused or trying to take advantage, either. They are people who are trying to live a life that fits with who they inherently identify themselves as, just as a straight, non-transgendered person does.

There are Deep Banded Iron formations around the world reflecting how the O2 released by photosynthesis changed the composition of the Oceans.  http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange1/current/lectures/Perry_Samson_lectures/evolution_atm/  Those changes took Geological time.

And let's not forget, Lee, that it was the fat White men's club (Gingrich & McConnell others) that huddled on President Obama's inagural night clicking whiskey glasses and probably snorting to plan their Just Say No congressional campaign and make President Obama a one-term president.  Voters had other plans and elected him twice.  Unfortunately, it never ceases to amaze me how voters will elect a party to the White House and then give that president an opposite majority in congress.  No.  President Obama's administration  wound up preventing the nation from going over the fiscal cliff, kept millions of workers and their families from going under financially by rescuing the auto industry, on and on....  And let's not forget that when Dubya left office after eight years the nation's unemployment was at 9.5.  President Obama's unemployment rate has been at an all-time low of 4.5 and has recently edged up to 5.0.

Under ITQ privatization consolidation was intended and virtually guaranteed in multiple fisheries. The consolidation increased and capitalized the net capital value of the fisheries. Privatization gave banks security for loans on vessels and operations costs. Processors, like those on the pacific coast gained access to consolidated fisheries guaranteeing consistent production and profits.  What was not clarified was that privatization spelled the end of distributive fisheries and well managed small boat mixed stock fisheries in US coastal communities.

It's not a secret that a more assertive political Islam is taking root in Canada in terms of demanding more accommodations for cultural practices that are only common in countries where freedom of expression and gender equality are treated with violent contempt. So we must ask what message it sends as a society to accommodate a religious practice that excludes women during their natural cycles, especially in public schools. Is it a form of """"cultural relativism"""" that we accept women pray at the back because otherwise they would arouse the men? Is defending Canadian values of gender equality more important than accommodating cultural practices under the guise of religious freedoms?

Reconsider your sources, both Biblical and Sister White.  Think of them like Paul does.  Paul testifies to Timothy that “All Scripture is god-breathed and is *useful* for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness …”  Paul’s relentless practice is to testify and where useful to reference scripture by way of additional illumination.  Paul never starts with scripture.  So simply testify as to your sense of what affords you hope in the context of faith and in the spirit of love.  Remember Jesus’ call to love your enemies?  What if that were not an obligation, and not even a tactic, but a description of one responding to seeing one’s self in another whom others only see as your enemy?  I have the sense that you want good for all of us.  What seems good for you?

The best thing that can be said about Wallace is that he eventually came to his senses (after he was shot) and spent his final years trying to make up for the pain he'd caused with his ignorant political racism.

Sadly, we have enjoyed too little of the latter in our fair burg over the past month. The sad spectacle of a northern city (as we are), incapable to dealing with nature's cold weather wonder (snow and ice) marks another sad note in the City of Vancouver's poor history of snow-pocalypses.  The Farmer's Almanac predicted a colder and wetter winter back in summer 2016. Sure, the freeze and thaw issues 'unique' to YVR are a problem, but that's why the City should have dealt with the matters when and as they occurred. They did not. The blame rests at the Mayor's doorstep, but oh look, he's away. Again.

He won't even returning the EU's calls contrary to a past admin who only targeted their largest industry VW/Deutsche bank. The EU's days are numbered, as analysts reiterate, never mind this business rag fabrication.  The truth is different: """"look at the Eurozone’s constituent parts: A savage depression in countries like Greece and Portugal, an unsustainable Italy, a Spain that is boosted only by new private debt, a French national budget out of control, banking systems that are effectively insolvent, and capital flows that continue to create a desert in the periphery as they rush into the banks of surplus countries like Germany and the Netherlands.""""

0,"the difficulty in assessing the legitimacy of taking an action that pits protester against revered national symbol, is that few individuals on either side seem to have a clear understanding of what exactly the end point of the action is meant to be.  When you protest against a state of affairs in a nation that has no easy answers, and do so through refusing to honour the symbolism within which the transgressions rest, but in which the best of the nation is also entrenched and for which so many died, you place yourself in the unpleasant position of having to argue that you are honouring the dead by refusing to pay homage to their direct sacrifice, while instead, honouring what they died for by acting upon the freedoms their sacrifices ensured.  you can get away with that for a while, and even be supported for a while in doing so, but after a while it starts to look like narcissism...because the dead don't ask for much.

0,"I did a quick scan of Hawaii rentals on AirBnB, and sure enough, not one of them have the Hawaii state tax ID on the ads that I saw.  I'm pretty confident that few (probably closer to 'none') of them are currently paying GET or TAT on their rental income.  What's frustrating about this is that enforcement of this issue should be one of the easiest things to do.  I mean, how often do lawbreakers actually advertise on a public website!  All the city/state needs to do is do a temporary hire of enforcement agents, who will respond to the ads.  When they get the address, they cross-check names in the state database to see if there's a tax ID number, and if there is, compare it to tax payments.  If there are no tax payments, they can send the owner a notice to pay up, explain their situation or face a lien.  I would be willing to bet that collections would more than offset the cost of hiring enforcement agents.

If you know it was know as Sivuqaq until 1898. Do you know why the people adopted the new name? It was because of what happened to Rev. Vene Gambell, his wife Nellie and their daughter. They were returning to the island for their fourth year teaching aboard the schnooner Jane Gray carrying 32 souls when they encountered a violent storm and sank with no survivors. The Islanders had loved their school and their teachers. In fact their Siberian relatives were jealous and complained to the Russian government about a lack of schools in their villages. Education got off to a good start in this region. The entire state is not a disaster. I'm OK with acknowledging past wrongs but the doers are mostly dead. Be best to try to engage village parents and children with the positive aspects of education rather than blaming ghosts.

Teachers experience first hand the societal problems families are faced with on a daily basis. They also differ on solutions to those problems. Attempting to influence legislators on viable solutions are not unanimously agreed to by all public employees. Under the current system, just talking with legislators doesn't seem to work does it?  Continuing the same system over and over and expecting different results is one of the definitions of insanity. How many times are voters going to buy that tax cuts for the rich don't result in significant jobs being created? Teachers are too busy each day with our children to ignore any attempt to modify some of the laws.

0,"We all have had the experience of a few teachers who were incompetent to do the job. Especially in High School. Sixty years ago my science teacher was trying to teach science out of a study guide, with no personal interest or experience in the subject. We delighted in sabotaging the experiments to see if he could figure out what was wrong. He couldn't. Soon he was gone. At the same time our math teacher was dedicated and inspirational. Probably little has changed since. Anyway, it is critical that STEM subjects be taught by people who know what they are doing, and more importantly are engaged in the subject. Faulty education in English may be damaging, but life in the real world will correct this. Faulty STEM education is far harder to overcome once the opportunity to achieve basic understanding is lost.

0,"John A Parker - Sigh!! Once more into the breach ....  Nobody is spending the principal (called the corpus) of the Permanent Fund. That is constitutionally protected. It isn't used to pay the PFD or State funding and can't be without a constitutional amendment.  A portion of the Permanent Fund is invested in stocks and bonds and returns a profit (most years). That profit goes into the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund, from which the PFD is drawn. The CBR's level is affected by stock market fluctuations, which is why sometimes the PFD is $300 and other times it's $2000. The CBR can be accessed for State funding with a vote of the Legislature. Alaska is required to balance its budget. We can't run a debt like the federal gov does. We have been covering our deficit with another savings fund that doesn't require Leg vote. That fund is almost empty. So now the CBR becomes the next place to draw from. That reduces the PFD. Eventually costs, if steady, will consume the entire fund. Got it?

High immigration in Canada since the 1990's when it went to 200,000+ are directly correlated with middle class decline, stagnant wages, reduced overall per capita well being, particularly for immigrants.  Over the next decade only 5 million boomers working who could retire and 6.5 million youth poised to enter the workforce. An economic theory on immigration for the public good would assess this fact, and drastically decrease immigration levels for 5-7 years to ensure employment for youth, some rise in wages and per capita GDP.  After 5 years, new immigration targets could be set again to adjust.  The Liberals set up an """"advisory committee"""" as an echo chamber to do what they wanted to do, that was never disclosed in their platform so they have no mandate.

The author correctly points out that coal jobs have been in steady decline since peak in 1925, a small increase was seen in the 70s. This decline isn't because of regulation, but automation. In contrast, coal production peaked in 2008. Jobs replaced by automation, won't come back. At best, job rates may go back to the previous local peak in 2011 (80,000 jobs). Trump may have created  15,000 jobs - or increased jobs by 0.001% of US labour force. An Imperceptible increase. But it will make coal coal co as mpanys and shareholder wealthy as he stated in his press conference (""""Make America Wealthy Again""""). I wonder what Trump's holdings in coal are?  Another salient point is that the USA is a net exporter of coal - they produce more than they need. Global demand is decreasing as countries (including China) are reducing coal consumption. Demand for US coal will neccessarily decline, despite what Trump does.

I am afraid that I don't agree with the rationale that says that any of us are further ahead as now we are on the hook for more than $500K in incarceration costs, whereas Breathalyzer interlock technology installed on all new cars built since 1982 would have prevented this accident and 200,000 more just like it.  This young woman has mental health issues that won't get resolved in jail in-fact she will be lucky to survive a 12-year sentence, when she could become a productive citizen well before then at less cost to us.  As a 4 million mile driver and a Master's-level regional planner I will agree that all it takes to kill someone on a bicycle is a monetary distraction, a strong gust of wind, or a blown truck tire, and almost all bike riders would be a whole lot safer on off-highway bicycle lanes than riding alongside any roadway.

0,"Robin Hood, Ms. Bukendorf isn't proposing that we cut teachers health or retirement benefits, she is saying that a huge percentage of our education budget is made up of things we can't cut (retirement & health benefits). Therefore, if we go Sen Giessel's route, we'd have to make deep/high impact cuts to things that actually impact classroom intruction. I'm also in Sen. Giessel's district, and I think that we should be considering new sustainable income before damaging our schools. Like Ms. Bukendorf, I favor a progressive income tax and a restructuring of the PFD or perhaps a sales tax. I don't like the idea of one group of Alaskans paying more (i.e. a particular industry) than another. However, the """"how"""" we get more revenue isn't as important to me as doing something before we damage our community and blow through our 8 billion dollar constitutional budget reserve.

0,"At some point in the latter part of the 19th century (ca. 1875), the Sulpicians -- for reasons that are not entirely clear -- had the insight and foresight to recognize that one of their young seminarians, William Henry O'Connell of Lowell, MA, was not a suitable candidate for the priesthood, and they dismissed him.  When that same Wm. Henry O'Connell became Archbishop of Boston in 1907, O'Connell returned the favor: he kicked the Sulpicians out of Boston and required them to dig up their dead and remove them as well.  In 2011, as part of the fallout from the sex abuse crisis, O'Connell's remains were removed from the tomb he had built for himself and buried on the grounds of the seminary. History confirms that the Sulpicians were right about O'Connell -- even if we don't know precisely what they knew about him.  I think history will confirm that they're right about Cordilione, too.

0,"Another issue that has been ignored is the unfair or inequitable treatment of homeowners and other asset owners regarding income on capital gains. In a logical world all income would be taxed the same. This would include salaries, capital gains on home sales, professional income, and capital gains on stock or other asset sales. This would go a long way to take some of the heat out of the real estate and stock markets, as both are inflated assets (aka bubbles). But if one wishes to maintain the capital gains exemptions on homes, it could be made more equal if it was a once in a lifetime thing and it was only for the average value of a home in Canada at the time of the claim, so the playing field was more equitable or equal. Increasing the holding period from one year to a five year minimum, with the holder being required to have paid personal income tax in Canada for that period might also help. These are all understandable and addressable issues.

At present those desperate to get their next fix steal and use their welfare to obtain opioids so it is unlikely they will be able to pay even token amounts for safe substances. I do believe, however, that the non-addict population will find the costs associated with drug use will be far less if enforcement activities are reduced, welfare is used legitimately and theft is reduced. Taxpayers will also be saved the costs of harm reduction centres and those associated with overdose response by the police and fire departments. Giving clean drugs to addicts may present moral issues but it is far less expensive than what is being done now.

I agree that the legislature spent way too much time on peripheral issues instead of addressing the economic problems the state is facing. I disagree with your characterization of a couple of those issues but that is not surprising. The facts support that trickle down economics works very well, it is just that democrats/liberals used to believe the same but since Reagan proved it works, they have to demean the process, regardless whether it works or not.

0,"In some things there can be no compromise. Slavery is one example and the income tax is another. A new tax always starts out small so it will be voted in. The federal income tax has soared as high as 94% in the highest tax bracket at one time in its history. It is the tax adopted by Marx & Engels in their “Communist Manifesto”. It is a forced redistribution of the wealth by the state from people who have earned it to people who have not earned it. This happens through various government benefits, subsidies & grants. If private citizens engaged in this system of legalized plunder, they would go to jail. Socialist leaning politicians can buy votes by promising government benefits to people who vote for them that the other guy has to pay for.

This project was concocted by ADF&G and the BOG in an attempt to establish a precedent for State sponsored predator control on National Wildlife Refuges.  A number of “trumped’ up claims by the State painted a false picture for the situation on Unimak.  It was the over-harvest of male caribou by commercially guided trophy hunters that created an unnatural bull:cow ratio, all under the auspices of “sound scientific management” by the State that figured in the decline of Unimak caribou.  Nearly 100 year pioneer caribou biologist Olaus Murie found that caribou populations on this restricted island have widely oscillated from zero to several thousand.

Pre-Columbian populations in the Americas upon first contact with Europeans led to a continent-wide pandemic that may have reduced the original inhabitants by as much as 90%. With no acquired immunity to European diseases the North American native population was decimated. I wouldn't pat our European ancestors on the back for being humanitarians after the first wave killed as much as 40 million North and South American natives. The deliberate spread of disease, that is biological warfare, among remaining indigenous populations, was practiced as policy as late as the 19th century. So this notion of a thin population as justification for European colonization has long been debunked.

Prior to the release of the video, the police called the shooting justified. The video clearly showed the young man walking (not running) away when he was shot, fell to the ground and shot numerous times again.  Rioting is bad.

0,"There are two key questions here. 1) What is the effect of being a """"sanctuary city?"""" The primary purpose has to be for the local police to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. This is actually essential for good policing. If people are afraid that the local cops will call ICE on them, they won't go to the local police for help when that sort of assistance is needed. 2) What can the Trumpolini regime do in retaliation? As the article pointed out, not much. In addition to the discussion in the article, there is federal appellate case law to the effect that any withholding of funds has to have a nexus to the federal-local conflict. In other words, a conflict over immigration does not provide the Feds sufficient reason to withhold road funds. It could justify withholding funds that would go to law enforcement, but since much (most?) of that funding is oriented towards increasing militarization of the local police, losing such funding would be good.

0,"So tell us exactly what your solution is for a lunatic fascist with thermonuclear weapons and other WMDs who continually threatens to """"annihilate"""" the RoK, Japan, and the US.  Kim's threats have particularly validity because of the way he treats North Koreans.  See, for example, the 2014 UN report detailing NK's crimes against humanity.  If he is prepared to murder and torture gratuitously innocent Koreans,  he would have no compunctions about murdering the West.  My first post is entirely reasonable in the context of Kim's reckless provocations, failure to obey UN resolutions and sanctions as well as the comments made by the leaders of Australia, SK, Japan and the US in response to Kim's threats, Kim's inhuman fascist regime, and Kim's capabilities.  I get tired of internet trolls like you who have not read extensively about the issue and are willfully ignorant of its complexities  and consequences.  If one of Kim's WMDs were to take out your ilk it might not be an entirely bad thing.

If the DOJ’s budget is shrinking, and the amount of money and time devoted to one thing—violent crime—is going up, then the amount of money and time devoted to another thing—white collar crime—will go down. ‘It [addressing violent crime] is for sure going to push resources away from other things,” says a former prosecutor, who adds that there is also a hiring freeze in the Southern District of New York, which is widely regarded as the office that does the most on white collar crime.

By the 20th century, the pickings get very slim. Toronto is an ugly city. Nearly everything built in the last 20 years is replicated a hundred times over in China's new cities. With the possible exception of Vancouver, Canada's largest cities are amazingly ugly. Our planners let developers and architects get away with pretty well anything they want. Thirty storey glass towers on low podiums usually highlighted in grey has become the defacto model of Toronto development. One of the world's richest and most  influential city? You would never know it by its architecture.

I'm pretty sure the species will survive, even if there's no church there telling us what to do, or not to do when it comes to sexuality.  I ALSO think that if we focus on love, (and the stuff I talked about in my post), much of this will work out.  What I mean by that is that by all accounts, being gay is not something """"contagious,"""" or otherwise """"spreadable.""""  So whatever that normal/natural percentage of gays exist, that's not likely to change.  I don't have answers, but I'm pretty sure that the church's teaching on human sexuality jumped the tracks a LONG time ago.  Spreading a litany of prohibitions, fears, name calling, and discrimination does little to foster what's REALLY important in human relationships. And remember, it's DESIGNED to teach this to our kids.  Today, we pay the price of that. I think the church needs to focus on something MORE basic.

0,"What growth? Growth fuelled by social welfare for new immigrants from tax dollars is what they want. GDP per capita has been, and is, declining = middle to low income earners (the majority) are all making less (income) and paying more (taxes/COLA). This is directly correlated with the substantial increase in immigration in the early 90's. Therefore, we have over two decades of economic statistics that show high immigration levels are directly correlated with worsening economics for middle to lower income earners (the majority). Also directly correlated with widening income gap, where the very wealthy get even wealthier.  With 6.5 million youth entering the job market in the next decade and only 5 million boomers who may (not will) retire and reduce consumption, there is already labour oversupply coming. After that decade, demographics start to balance again UNLESS you want vast labour oversupply to depress wages and human rights - then you propose high immigration levels.

That logic, extended out, implies that every county employee who is in a position to enforce county policy -- animal control, building inspector, even judge -- presents the same or similar conflict.  Governments at all levels use their own employees to carry out policy and have done for centuries throughout the world.  And they should be able to.  The issues here are around transparency, an evidently complete abrogation of responsibility by the county to its taxpayer, and a perceived lack of mechanism for redress.  There are the courts, but that's a costly option taxpayers shouldn't be forced to pursue.  That leaves the ballot box.

0,"What is uniquely and exclusively possible in and through Christ is the negation of historical expiation in the very instant of its promise.

For those """"uniquely ready"""" to receive the gospel—that is, those living towards death who find in the ecstasy of worldly pleasure an annihilative corollary—the Christian faith, with indiscriminate cruelty, opens the present as a wound that it will always prevent from healing. As a result of this wound, we can never look back, only forward, to the null point of impossibility. You, my friend, miss what is significant here: the eschatology of Judgment Day, far more than atheism, is a nihilistic refusal of messianic time.

And through that process, science has arrived at a conclusion on manmade climate change that is as solid as that on evolution, the health impacts of smoking, and the connection between AIDS and HIV.  To DENY that these consensuses don't exist is not free speech as much as it is a assault on the laws of physics and nature, two forces that have nasty habit of surprising a hubristic humanity.  To say that the Holocaust warrants more study and data collection, that reasoned skepticism is necessary, is NOT the same as saying that it didn't happen. To DENY that it happened is to invite the forces of anti-Semitism and white supremacy back into history.

But when the protection is weak, and the running game is getting stuffed, Trevor just doesn't have the strengths to help make up for those other deficiencies on O.  A double-threat QB that can take off and scramble when protection breaks down can help counter the pass rush, but Trevor is weak on scrambling ability. He also stays locked into a receiver too much, and is slow to read and react.  Unfortunately our other QBs may not be much better in those areas.  But at this point I think we just need to make the change, because this combination clearly isn't working.  The main problem remains the bad OL, of course, but we're pretty much stuck there.  At QB we can make a change.  I'd give Oz the start for the next few games.  If he does well, great, but if not, Paxton should be healed enough next month to take over for the rest of the season as his (final) test.

Most of them have been determined to be refugees.  There is a loophole be exploited and the law skirted but it is the government by the  Safe Third Country Agreement exploits a narrow and technical loophole in the law set out in Singh v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177.

I've noticed that others that have done horrendous crimes shroud themselves with a cult following that have had their minds emotionally clouded by hate.

It looks like the hate was instilled into the cult following by the inbreeding of hate, into them, by slick eloquent talkers. They accuse the opposition of exactly what they are doing to take the focus off of themselves. Beware of the slick eloquent talker. Check out history. The cult following have been conned into protecting the supreme leader at all costs. President Trump is not a slick or eloquent speaker. People should judge him by his actions and not what slick people try to con them into thinking. I feel actions speak louder than words. President Trump has shown a total support for our troops.

0,"For those who disregard TNRM as ineffective, perhaps you should ask real life colony managers how dramatically it decreases population growth. The biggest problem with TNRM is that is isn't being allowed in the places it is most needed. When a property manager or a state department refuses to allow volunteers to TNRM on their property they are only doing one thing - ensuring that the feral cat population increases.  Additionally, much of the population growth in managed colonies is due to pet abandonment. Irresponsible pet owners grow tired of caring for a cat, and dump it. Or they neglect to spay their own cat, she gets out one day, has babies, and they leave the mom and kittens in a nearby colony. In animal rescue, we see countless situations where cats have been dumped. Because humans are going to continue to be irresponsible, eradicating feral cat colonies is only going to lead to new cats coming into their now vacated territory and repeating the vicious cycle.

""""Genocide"""" might also be applied to the mass killings of indigenous peoples in the USA by American troops and settlers.  It is worth recalling that, after Little Big Horn, Sitting Bull led his Lakota tribe into Saskatchewan in Canada for refuge in 1876 where they stayed for 5 years. During much of the time the Lakota sought refuge in Canada, Sir John A. MacDonald was Canada's Prime Minister.  Sitting Bull was able to judge just who threatened """"genocide"""" and who didn't.

Also if the first nations are going to strive to identify themselves as a distinct racial group, unique in the Canadian multicultural mosaic, then it would be expected that others will start to see them as a group and make observations (it's what people do) so it's not being racist - it's being obliging to what this group desires.

Meaning don't invade countries on fear induced false pretence. AKA Unlawful orders.  Example...First Iraq war. They just rick rolled Kuwait and looted the country basically. The UN gave permission to liberate Kuwait. So America 'shock and Awww's"""" for a couple days and the war was over. People, many of them journalists ask """"Why don't we go all the way to Baghdad?""""  Because our orders was to liberate Kuwait. Not conquer Iraq. Why? Because that's all the U.N. authorised. We didn't want war with half the middle east. That's why Israel didn't run over the other half of Iraq, and draw other countries into the war.  It would have been unlawful to do anything other than liberate Kuwait.  Unlawful wars make 4 star Generals and 'full bird' Colonels to resign in protest. AKA Second Iraq war. 17 years of war and counting. You have no idea...Seriously.

Now it is French, Spanish,  Japanese, or Mandarin. In fact early Mandarin or Mandarin immersion programs are becoming more popular. A nod to the changing demographics here, and where business and trade opportunities lie in the future.  As someone who has raised kids in the Richmond system, to be honest much of the popularity of French immersion programs here were for the most part as their school within a school concept.  They did not have to accept children with ESL challenges, or  more severe learning disabilities. The French Immersion program was perceived as being exclusionary, thus having an  educational advantage over classrooms where half the kids struggled with speaking English or had special needs.  It was very little to do with parents wanting their kids to have some sort of """"distinct Canadian"""" education.

Coupled with the credibility loss; are the closures of many seminaries. There are few vocations and they are now being shipped out to Rome. There has been a major decline in church attendances coupled with ageing clergy and devotees.

0,"I think for me at least, a big piece of my frustration with the church since Vatican II, is that I've seen precious little sincere attempt at the renewal that was promised in VII.  My sense is that so many conservatives in the church believe that the very nature of conservatism requires opposition to renewal.  I don't see it that way.  But I think that particular brand of conservatism has hurt the church badly, because renewal is not only needed, but it is ESSENTIAL to any potential for the church to be a force in society.   I think this lack of renewal has aggravated the church's response to the scandal.  The pending choice to exclude victims from the papal commission on abuse bears NO resemblance to a church in renewal...  For the church to have ANY hope of becoming what the Council fathers intended, renewal is not just central, but THE key to the future.  Liturgy is not """"for"""" us, but """"of"""" us.

While partisan media definitely has pushed people apart, the """"traditional"""" media has had a much lesser role in that. I also don't think the evidence supports the assertion that Trump's words have been taken out of context (by traditional media, not partisan media), or that the messengers (not the actual actors themselves) have stoked fears and racism.

Trump has been able to show just how political our judicial system has become, the far left Judge in Hawaii made his political agenda crystal clear.

More White Collar crime diluted by a corrupt justice system without justice for the victims and refusing to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate the human filth perpetrating these ongoing scams.  The results of deregulation of government control over allowing criminal acts to have legal immunity as more gifts from the Corporate Millionaire Congressional agents and the Corporate Presidential Administrations starting with Nixon on through the present.  Amplified during all Republican administrations i.e., Reagan, Bush I, Bush II, and including Democrats, i.e., Carter, Clinton, Obama.

0,"GBA, if you really want to improve traffic flow, you might consider the fact that induced demand says congestion results from too many travel lanes. Perhaps your opposition to this bond is the right decision for the wrong reasons.  Locally, over the past decade we've seen about 9000 commuters in cars added to Eugene's roads. Coincidentally, we've also had just over 9000 former commuters who rode bikes, walked and took the bus get back into their cars. Want less congestion? Find a way to get those people back onto their bikes, the bus and into their walking shoes.  If we actually want to get people to choose to leave their cars parked, we're going to have to deal with what's ailing EPD. The officers, almost all of whom live in the suburbs, simply won't patrol or respond to crimes on the bike paths nor will they enforce traffic laws.

0,"Nazis weren't socialists, and they weren't of the left. Granted, """"Socialism"""" formed part of the party's name, but it can't be divorced from the word that preceded it. Goebbels never put out propaganda extolling the virtues of socialism without ensuring that the reader/listener knew he was talking about national socialism, and Hitler - well, if he loved socialism so much, why would he launch the largest invasion in human history against one of the very few countries that had adopted it? The Nazis were, first and foremost, German nationalists, while Socialism is an international movement - """"workers of the world, unite!,"""" and all that. The ideologies are incompatible. Saying the Klan was founded by Democrats might be technically accurate, but it's pretty disingenuous - the party today has little in common but name with the Dems of the Reconstruction Era. It's the same with Republicans - one can hardly imagine a modern R going to war to liberate oppressed and exploited non-white laborers.

0,"I am a local citizen of the Kodiak Island Borough, but am most concerned about Kenai's Borough's invocations, when they have come to allow a Satanist to so invoke Satan as to exclude anything God ever endowed the nation of the United States of America with, its great founders and constitution.  Throughout, it was always invoking none other than the true God of Heaven and earth, Who created all things and sustains it--even our local regions in Alaska.  I should call on the Name of Jesus Christ, God's Son to REVOKE all the satanist sought to invoke over the Kenai penninsula, and wherever else she or her kind would seek to encompass.

And given the government's track record they are probably right.  2) They hope to grow their earnings over time and don't want their hard earned money being taken when they do, especially with the inevitable rate-hikes that would come down the road.

It is to allow churches, businesses and other property owners to give permission for a camp site on their property for someone that is vetted thru St. Vincent DePaul. There is a requirement to provide sanitary facilities including trash disposal. The current program has a lower complaint rate at 1% than the we experience with the general population. In addition, we would also set the the IGA with the City to also cover law enforcement response so that it will not add any burden to the LCSO. The folks are already camping along the Northwest expressway and the the river in groups. This program brings them out into dispersed sites where behavior can be better controlled and hopefully get people back on track to permanent housing.  PS. Please report all crime even if we do not investigate it helps us build our statistics to show the real extent of our crime problems.

The immigrants that arrived over the last 30 years have caused the inflation in housing prices that has pushed young generational  Vancouverites down and out of the market. Wealthy immigrants who arrived earlier realized that they could buy homes that could be sold later for healthy profits to future wealthy immigrants. One has only to look at the change that has occurred in many of Vancouver's tonier neighbourhoods to realize just how effective this speculation has been. The majority of generational owners have cashed in and younger generationals cannot compete for the price of admission. The 'foreign buyer' ploy is just a deflection that is used by Liberal/left/progressives to avoid admitting what is a readily transparent cause of the housing crisis in Vancouver.

0,"No, professor, contrary to your cherished liberal spiel, we live in a Republic ... it could be called a representative democracy, but not a pure democracy. Just as our founding fathers set 2 Senators per state, & based the House on population, the electoral college keeps urban areas from undue domination of the whole country, much of which is still """"rural"""". Our Constitution, including voting regulations, is crafted to prevent undue influence of minorities by the majority. """"an undeserved presidency."""" ... you say.

0,"Is his resignation related to academic freedom or academic incompetence? Had he himself been trapped in the traffic, had a few drinks, and indulged in a rant in a bar, his poor judgement might be understandable. However, he wrote and published this extremely sloppy piece of work in a major national magazine. I would argue that this deliberate, considered action reveals that he is not that well suited to the post he held. Moreover, he did not even have the judgement to add that these were his personal opinions, not those of McGill - and his post at McGill appeared alongside his name in the publication. As I understand it, he was not fired, but removed only from the directorship and will continue to work for the institute for his three year contract. Yes, he has the right to express his opinions, but at what point are academics going to use freedom to mask poor performance?

It seems to boil down to this: People who want more gun control see the proliferation of firearms as a threat to their personal safety and to the  safety of society in general. They think that by decreasing the number of guns in circulation that they will be more safe. I would agree with this when applied specifically to criminals and the emotionally unstable. People who are opposed to gun control and advocate for greater gun rights see more gun control and more impediments to obtaining firearms and ammunition as a threat to their personal safety and to the safety of society in general.

Still Mary and Joseph considered him a soon to be new born child, a person.  Joseph and Mary recognized Jesus was a boy.  Jesus remained a boy and became a man.  He was persecuted and crucified because of his conservative beliefs.  No much has changed in 2000 years.  """"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.""""

0,"Senator Wielochowksi is certainly smart, but he is a politician that tries to score political points. Here are the facts:  The exploration credit expired in July 2016.  So covering 75% of exploration costs is no longer an issue.  Covering 65% percent of development cost ONLY applies to Cook Inlet, which is a very different tax regime than SB 21 (which ONLY applies to the North Slope). Fortunately, HB 247 reduced Cook Inlet credits for 2017 and then completely eliminates them in 2018.  Thus, the 65% of Cook Inlet development credits (which I agree are too generous) has been addressed.  Interestingly, Bill W. and Les and all of the others that bemoan the Cook Inlet credits actually voted for them under the Cook Inlet recovery act.  But they never mention that fact for some reason.

The female participant had left the premises without murder, homicide, or other physical altercation.  That much is undisputed fact.  Now whether the dude really had a gun or threatened her with a gun is unverified and simply an allegation.  If the situation had involved a man holding a hostage at gun point, we would have a very different situation.  It is important to carefully distinguish situations.  In a true hostage situation, use of deadly force may be justified provided some reasonable attempt to peacefully resolve the situation first is made if at all possible.  Police commanders made a wise decision in the sense that the benefit of continued confrontation was questionable.  Their decision may have been backed up by information to which we are not privy such as serious question as to the veracity of the allegations against the dude.

Ditto for Microsoft.  Trump was doing what he took an oath to do; defend and protect the United States of America.  Signing on to the PA would have meant giving up the country's sovereignty to some faceless Eurogovernment bureaucrats.  As the U.S. Fed lowers taxes, allows industries (including King Coal) and ordinary Americans to prosper and grow as it gets out of their way Canada will be forced to either do likewise or go the way of banana dictatorships like Venezuela.

1,"Islamophobia is consequence of hypocrisy of Muslim leaders and journalist like Sheema Khan. Islam is against abortion (or killing unborn babies in last month of pregnancy). Islam is pro-life. Islam stands towards gays, lesbians and gay marriage is completely opposite of what Liberals and communists of NDP stand for. Islam is very conservative while Islam leaders of Canada associate themselves with leftist and liberals. The latest know very well what Islam stands for but they need votes. This is why they want Muslims as """"allies"""". Otherwise they fear the stand of Islam towards life, gay marriage etc and reject Islam. Of course conservatives will not support Muslims as they are on the other side of the fence therefore, Muslims they have no real friends in right or left. If Muslim leaders try to associate themselves with those who in most part agree with them (in abortion, traditional family values etc) they will have more real allies and solve Islamo-phobia issues. Until then good luck.

When I served in BUPERS, (the Bureau of Naval Personnel), in DC I was responsible for processing Naval personnel for discharge.

He said they were queers who, regardless of any commendations, were being immediately discharged. I was floored. Now in 2017 the president tweets an order to expel all transgenders without first discussing it with the military generals. That was the military. Now we have a church who is without a way to “handle” those who are identified as LGBTQ’s without breaking their tenets.

There is no question that this has not only changed the face of the country, particularly in the cities, but has led to white flight, undocumented by the MSM. As for the motion before the house, this is a further infringement on freedom of speech in Canada, amidst serious concern south of the border about immigration from certain countries, in contrast to the serious concern north of the border to ensure re-election of the Liberal government through immigration from those same countries, where the female role is to have babies, hide their faces, and submit to male domination.

And even now, with evidence that the DNC did what it could to derail him, he still did his part at the Convention. Many of us Progressives watched her husband run to the left in the primary and then rule from the center right, signing NAFTA and destroying many social programs that the newly poor really needed. So it is a valid questioning we do, when we ask just who she will be if elected. That is what a campaign is about, questioning.

Defense lawyers will pour over all these forms in the coming weeks looking for the slightest sign of a misstatement or pre-judgement or procedural error or, hell, a spelling mistake on which to launch complex judicial challenges.

0,"If someone was married in a civil or Protestant ceremony or otherwise not following the rules of the Church (e.g. if there was an impediment) there are two ways to regularize the situation. The usual is a convalidation, in which the couple take their vows again witnessed by a priest or deacon.  Radical sanation (""""sanatio in radice"""" for """"healing in the root""""), a retroactive validation and retroactive application of any dispensations, without renewal of consent, is also available and more appropriate for certain situations. As I understand it--and I'm not a canon lawyer--if there is no impediment a convalidation can be done by the parish priest but a radical sanation is from the bishop and reviewed by the diocesan tribunal.  These are often done when one or both of the spouses returns to the Church and wants to present himself or herself for Communion again.

A fixed 5 year mortgage carried a smooth 12% interest rate, compared to 2.5% or so today. Payments on a $250,00, 5 year fixed mortgage with a 12% interest rate would be $60k or so. Imagine what that would do to house prices.  Cheap money is the #1 cause of house price increases. Demand has increased, and supply cannot keep up. Post 2008 governments across the world have been inflating their way out of trouble, or so they think. Inflation in the market for goods and services has been dampened by technological changes, free trade, competition and mobility, as it has in the labour market. But let's not kid ourselves if the Bank of Canada has to raise interest rates by a few points, for example to protect a plummeting Loonie a lot of people will look wistfully back on the days of cheap money and expensive housing.

Liberals believe they have the moral high ground because alt-right extremists supposedly are more despicable than alt-left extremists.  That is wrong; there are no grades of despicability.  One has to wonder if the events in Charlottesville would have occurred if the small group of disaffected individuals held their rally to protest the possible removal of the General Lee statue and everyone, especially the media, ignored them.  Unfortunately, alt-left groups were going to let that happen.  Instead, they put a call to arms, and trouble, violence and a killing occurred.  Trump was right about a lot of blame to go around on both sides.

If we give workers something to vote for, the populists won't stand a chance.

0,"Ms. Kobliner makes a number of salient points in her book. The one we take exception to is the idea that children shouldn't know what gifts cost. We believe that gift-giving offers parents the perfect opportunity to discuss and model wise spending, as children are the most interested in learning about money, when they want something! In fact, Ms. Kobliner's description of a teary 10 year old needing to be told that his birthday gift of an ipad cost what several less expensive items might have, gives voice to the idea that lots of good can come from children understanding the full value of a request, before they make it. Ask yourself if you would prefer to be surprise and disappoint your kids, or prepare and delight them when their birthday or another gift-giving opportunity presents itself. We believe that you can teach your kids about money while making their dreams come true. Karen Holland (giftingsense.com)

0,"If you read article, you would have noticed that Ibbitson correctly pointed out that previous attempts by governments to encourage Cdns to have more children did not work, and are equally unlikely to work in the future. The primary reason for that is that young people simply don't want to have more kids. If you want more kids, no one will object though. Feel free to breed to your heart's content. On your statement that the family is the most 'sacred thing in this nation """", many people probably define family differently than you do. Kids are not necessarily a part of it. You can't choose for them. As for places like Denmark, Sweden and Norway, each has very different demographics from  Canada, so they are not exactly comparable. Denmark, for example still has a relatively large number of people in the working-age range, and a much smaller number of retired people, so they have less need for immigration. Sweden has moderate population growth due largely to immigration.

We can expect and should be prepared for more extreme weather events..not be caught short so frequently as we have been, because too many citizens were too tight to cough up some taxes, like other snow states.

As such, these criminal studies are totally bogus.  And as to helping the economy... that is true. They do. BUT, not in the first gen. It is on average their 2nd gen KIDS that help, the same as any GOOD Americans do. Oddly, by 3rd gen, they are just like any other American based on where they are raised at.  For this to be of value, far better to roll H1Bs into this and leave the green card at current levels.

0,"Anyone who supports Walker in this has not been paying attention to what he and the legislature have been wasting money on.  They will take it all if they can, and it does seem to be their goal.  If were getting our historical share of oil profits, there would be no 'crisis'.  They created this 'crisis' not only to take all of our oil profits today, but to create this excuse to dip into the fund and deplete the entire thing.  The oil companies have long resented the permanent fund believing that it really belongs to them, so they paid/installed oil company employee legislators to create SB21.  This Governor Walker is a different person than the one we elected.  When elected Walker said he would not take the PFD to fund government and that this was the first time in history we were making less than zero from production taxes.  Since then he has gone around saying we will never make enough on oil, and we must use the PFD.

This, logically, means we are stripping the soil of its nutrients with each generation of trees that we harvest. Eventually, the foresters will be harvesting dust.  Unless your link demonstrates that we are indeed replacing the nutrients, then I see no point in reading it... and if it does say it, then your literature is lying.

I think that all of the stuff about his odious family is beside the point.  He should have been treated on the merits of the evidence against him, not the actions of his family.

The compensation is to enable him to pay his legal bills and the cost of providing him with an education to start his life as a Canadian.

He was removed by Pope Francis from this position and from other dicasteries on account of his orthodoxy.

Truth of the matter is, both Hitler and Mussolini had borrowed/took more from the right than they did from the left. The NEED to buy into the neocon or neolib, all or nothing labels of today, plays into the politically correct/politically incorrect side more than the intellectually correct/intellectually incorrect side.

In the last election a few of the rigid hardline conservatives were shown the door, but not nearly enough. Embracing the worst the Alaska Legislature has to offer, the folks in Soldotna and parts of Anchorage saw fit to reelect conflict-of-interest kings Peter Micciche and Kevin Meyer to the Senate. And every recent effort to limit the influence of money in our politics and adopt more effective anti-corruption rules in the Legislature has been viciously opposed by Alaska republicans...yet the voters keep sending them to Juneau.  With voters like that good government in Alaska will remain pure fantasy.

It would also be helpful if they didn't alter and obfuscate that data, first by altering the historical record (5 times!) with arbitrary adjustments to the historical record going back to 1880, making past temperatures seem cooler than the original record said they were in order to make the temperature rise appear to be more dramatic (but still less than 1-degree), while taking most of the current temperatures (a) predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere, while taking very few readings in the Southern hemisphere where it appears to be cooling, and (b) taking most of the Northern Hemisphere readings in urban """"heat sinks.""""

Don’t single out a particular country when other countries are doing the same thing otherwise you lose moral authority. There should be just one demand & everyone should agree to stop as soon as the goal is met otherwise the target will not change if it is not confident that the sanctions will stop. It is especially wrong to hurt innocents when there’s little chance of success.  Omar Barghouti, the founder of BDS, won’t end BDS until Israel agrees to take in all Palestinian refugees.

But that does not prevent the community to enforce those laws through community pressure even without a judgement.  The problem is that Sharia is not strictly a """"religious law."""" It is a law that does not recognize a separation of church and state, it governs both the religious and the secular sphere simultaneously. Therefore, since its significant incompatibilities with Western culture and law, it is prone to create a parallel society.  Religious courts, such as Jewish, Amish, Catholic tribunals are inherently compatible with Western culture and law, since they, the Judeo-Christian tradition, originated both. Therefore the danger for a creation of a parallel society is practically null.  American native societies are a special case. They are in fact parallel societies, but they do not have as their stated intention to transform the majority society's laws and culture as Sharia (and Qur'an) does.

I assume that anyone marching with them was marching in support of those goals, whether armed or not (though many, if not most, were armed) and whether members of the various white supremacy groups or not. That seems to me a perfectly reasonable assumption. I don't think people who espouse violent racism are in any way """"nice"""" people or """"good"""" people, particularly if they organize under that banner.  It's reasonable to assume that there may have been some FBI operatives marching along. Maybe they were the """"nice"""" people.

0,"I made a post a few days ago concerned about the dialogue on this page and I don't like it. As a sex-abuse survivor I am very concerned about potential sex criminals on the street. I am also concerned about how our society deals with sex criminals and don't feel ostracizing sex offenders is productive.  The climate in our society is filled with so much hate towards sex criminals and all that I have studied and read has led me to understand that they have been experiencing self-loathing, self-hate from a young age and this is their trigger.I took the time to research this situation and look at the pages involved since I am involved with the BURN community. I don't think what Illy did was that horrible, but some of the things people said when the post was shared were atrocious and unhelpful. People are often not mature enough to deal with info like that in a productive way. I thought my fellow Burners would be above the typical societal response but boy was I wrong. It saddened me.

However, ICE says it considers military service a positive factor and exercises prosecutorial discretion on a case-by-case basis. Ultimately, it’s up to the discretion of an immigration judge to remove the status of an alien. If an alien has no legal status, ICE may detain and remove the individual from U.S. territory.

Another GG and Arenado is his equal. Schmidt won 10 GG.  The current and previous PED eras eviscerated offensive production benchmarks. Schmidt led the NL in HR for 8 years. He was a 3-time MVP and completed his career with 1,595 RBI and 548 HR. Bonds, A-Rod, Sosa, McGwire, and on and on all """"juiced"""" their way to gaudy stats.

Even with further battery technology advances, EVs will still be extremely range limited for the average consumer. If I drive from Mississauga to the cottage near North Bay, an EV can't get me there (351km using the 407, 382km without the 407).  In Canada like the U.S. we haven't the electricity infrastructure or generation in place to handle much beyond a 4% or 5% EV market. In Canada we have 34 million registered vehicles, Ontario has just over 12 million vehicles. There are roughly 50,000 EVs in Canada, which equals about 0.15% of all vehicles.  California is the largest U.S. car market, and accounts for approximately 48% of cumulative plug-in sales in the American market from 2011 to June 2016. Even as the biggest, EVs in California amount to just 3.1% of the vehicles on the road. EV sales have actually declined as a percentage against ICE in the U.S. going from 0.72% in 2014 to 0.66% in 2015.

I think I saw Robert Reich give one that seemed plausible to me (involved the fact that the company just needs to complete contracts which the suppliers could walk away from given lower oil prices).  But aside from that, it seems to be substantially similar to anti-GMO protests or telescope protests.

0,"This article's correct. Most guns used in crime are indeed sourced by criminals through already illegal means. The majority via straw sales, which background checks, however expanded, cannot effect as the straw buyer can pass the check, or transfers from people (often illegally) possessing them already aware of the transferee's prohibited status. Since in both cases the suppliers are already willing to break transfer laws, it's inane to think they'd do any expanded checks. Particularly since such checks are absolutely unenforceable in practice, as there is no way to discover, much less prove in court, that a transfer occurred absent a confession (which still creates a """"they said/they said"""" situation), unless it is witnessed and probably recorded by law enforcement in the act.  The only possible group any expanded background check might impact is the theoretical case of a legal possessor unknowingly selling to a prohibited person, but there's no evidence that is a significant source.

0,"Thanks for your reply, LFS2.  Your opinion is pretty much mainstream, if you look up the various states' rules on disenfranchisement and restoration of the vote.  Most require completion of sentence and parole, or sometimes, probation.  Some require restitution, an insurmountable barrier in many cases.  Some require a pardon from the governor, which few (my guess) would get.  Florida requires you to petition the state after 5-7 crime-free years, a double whammy aimed at African-Americans along with voter intimidation of most other types, in a state that surpasses most in voter discouragement targeted at persons with dark skin.  Incidentally, the huge number of African-Americans purged from voter roles for being felons in Florida far exceeds the actual number who were felons.

And if we get the balanced budget made an Amendment to the Constitution, it will become illegal to pay out Welfare with money we don't have.

0,"My current thinking is that I'll leave Bernier off the ballot altogether.  While I personally agree with many/most of his policies, I think he'll have a hard time selling them to the general voting public that may not be ready for, or receptive to, some fairly dramatic changes in the way the country is governed.  Coyne wrote a good piece in the NP about Bernier's pros and cons, including his tendency to """"oversell"""" some of his policies which may scare off some voters who could otherwise be in favour of them.  Because of that, I don't think he has much of a chance against Trudeau in 2019.  I'll probably leave off Scheer as well, as I've just never been all that impressed with him and social conservatism won't be a winning strategy in 2019.  I may add Rick Peterson to my ballot just for s's and giggles.  If you deem knocking out Trudeau to be the most important aspect of the 2019 election, in my mind there are only candidates with a plausible chance of doing that - Raitt, Chong, O'Toole

0,"Too bad the SA editors, in their zeal to make the case for enforcement, have again failed to mention that nearly all of the Kunia Loa ag lots have been rated """"inferior"""" ag land with rocky, gullied, sloped/steep sloped,  insufficient water and no irrigation infrastructure.  Trying to force owners to live elsewhere while attempting to farm will be a policy failure.  The only agriculture activity that could possibly be profitable on 95% of the lots would be livestock, but this is impractical if farmers are unable to live on site to protect and care for their animals.  Livestock would akso result in large amounts of fecal matter and erosion, not to mention methane release.  The bottom line is that the lots on this parcel would be better zoned as rural residential or agricultural with one Ag dwelling allowed per lot. Big Island has thousands of rural, off-grid homes. Why not allow a few here?  Reducing affordable housing units by bankrupting these small farmers is not good land use policy.

But there's a rule that often plays havoc with Occam's Razor. This is VOLTAIRE'S DICTUM. It says that the human brain is unable-- not unwilling but physically unable -- to reach a conclusion that lowers the brain's owner income or self esteem. The relevance here: What Damore wrote was: Women have different abilities than men. From here on I paraphrase his words (about narrower standard deviation of intelligence distribution); but what it means is that there are far fewer foolish women than foolish men (hence only 5% of all prisoners worldwide are women), but also far fewer super intelligent women that super intelligent men (hence only 30 of 3,000 chess grand masters are women.) Men are more extreme, for good or ill, women are more homogeneous. These are facts. But a female reader's brain won't let her assimilate it.

I'd start with a look at county efficiency in purging registered voter lists of those no longer eligible to vote, such as those who have moved out of state.   County clerks have few tools to know when a registered voter is no longer eligible.  Accordingly, the baseline of registered voters is likely overstated, the effect of which is to push down the voting participation percentage.  That said, I understand Neal's point - real change at the ballot box is rare, particularly in Hawaii where incumbents are rarely defeated.  This is in part due to a political system lacking in transparent metics.  Many well run cities and counties employ professional managers who use key indicator dashboards to set goals and assess performance.  Hawaii is bereft of both - professional managers and dashboards - freeing politicians from real accountability, which in turn depresses turnout.

0,"The first thing people need to realize is that Trump's tax plan doesn't add up, given his other initiatives.     In fact, it points to a huge increase in their deficit and a huge increase in debt.    Combine that with Trump's protectionist rhetoric.     It sounds really great to bring back jobs to the U.S., but with that comes higher costs which WILL be passed on to the consumers.   Then there's healthcare costs.  The second thing people need to know is what's involved in moving to the U.S. and what the long-term implications are from a tax perspective.    I've worked in the U.S. so know a little bit about it.    As a green-card holder, you can work for up to 7 years.     After that, you will be subject to the U.S. Exit taxes which are prohibitively high.     The only way to avoid that is to move back before, or take out U.S. citizenship.     U.S. citizenship means that you will have universal taxation as long as you remain a citizen, be subject to US Estate taxes, etc

The Commonwealth is stronger now than it ever has been. Rwanda has recently joined and other states are queuing up for membership. It is a bastion of Soft Power, where it functions on allure rather than force, by carrot rather than stick. It has given India a much needed platform on it's way to become a global powerhouse. It has given the smallest nations in the world a seat at the table and a voice to be heard. It proves developing states with unmatched technical assistance, and a common language that enhances trade.

0,"Please note that these statistics reflect high school graduation in a four year time frame. Not all students learn at the same rate, for a variety of reasons. That is true at the high school level as well as in the elementary classroom. For example, there is a waiting list at Springfield's Gateways High School, where students are most often significantly behind in credits, and where they can take the extra time to master math, science, language arts, and other essential subject areas. Teachers there work extremely hard to ensure that these students get a chance at a diploma. So do most of the students, who don't get counted in Springfield's  on-time graduation statistics. That, in my mind, is a shortcoming in the report, not the school district who places a value on learning and makes budgetary and material commitments to educate all students.

Could that technology not be implemented quickly?  Meanwhile, I would think there is already a readily available conventional """"close support"""" defense option using semi-automatic shotguns with heavy bird shot (#5 for turkeys seems appropriate...) that should be able to take out large numbers of drones  rather quickly (if the agents get some skeet-shooting practice with the """"enhancement"""" of multiple clay targets, then some real, cheap, drones) without the much greater risks of weapons using bullets/explosives that can travel much further, and inflict far more """"collateral damage"""" than birdshot would.

0,"Nonsense. Both Harper and Mulroney were impacted by what happened in the US.  The first Trudeau managed a operating loss  which Mulroney fixed but was over whelmed by the Paul Volker interest rat hikes of the early 1980's  largely because the first Trudeau left a huge deficit. The following Liberal government benefited from the implementation of the GST and falling interest rates. Harper with the approval of the opposition Liberals and NDP  ran deficit to fight a US created recession. He balanced it after a few years.  In both cases it was nothing the conservatives did. Both Trudeau's ran huge deficits for no reason.

The ugly truth is there is a great deal of crime related to black males in America.

When you see a black athlete being praised for their on field accomplishments it seems the mom always gets the thanks, as they should, but you seldom see the dad in the picture. When a black youth is killed it seems the mom is always their to be interviewed. Seldom is the dad to be found. America doesn't have a police violence problem, it has an absentee father problem.

0,"The US EP-3 was operating about 70 miles away from the PRC island province of Hainan, and about 100 miles away from the Chinese military installation in the Paracel Islands, when it was intercepted by two PRC J-8 fighters.  A collision between the EP-3 and one of the J-8s caused the death of a PRC pilot, and the EP-3 was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan.  The 24 crew members were detained and interrogated by the Chinese authorities until a statement was delivered by the United States government regarding the incident.  The exact phrasing of this document was intentionally ambiguous and allowed both countries to save face while defusing a potentially volatile situation between militarily strong regional states.  . Diplomacy is not 'doing nothing but bluster'.  Diplomacy is sane and reasoned policy.  .  Trump hasn't even any grasp of the concept of sanity or reason. .

Trump claims that our generals and military experts agree with this position.  Nevertheless critics point out that Trump made his decision during a controversy over the cost of transgender surgeries in the budget process which was dividing Republican senators; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff quickly pointed out that policy has not changed; reports suggest that Secretary Mattis was """"appalled"""" by Trump's tweets about transgender troops.

0,"Outwardly your suggestion seems reasonable, but I'm not sure it's appropriate in this case. While people still revere them, relegating history and symbols to museums  is probably not going to work.  Bear in mind that the Nazi party and displaying its symbols are banned under German law. Displaying a confederate flag, and even promoting racism are not against the law in the US. Those who protest against the removal of confederate symbols and policies are acting within their rights. Moreover, America has always tried to take a brotherly view towards the Civil War- recognizing heroes on both sides while letting bygones be bygones.  Removing the statue is a form of censorship. If Charlottesville wants to change the way it displays its racial history, adding new information is better than hiding the past.

Explaining the U.S. vote, Power quoted a 1982 statement from then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, which declared that Washington “will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements.” “That has been the policy of every administration, Republican and Democrat, since before President Reagan and all the way through to the present day,” Power said.  “One would think that it would be a routine vote,” Power said. But she acknowledged that, in reality, the vote was “not straightforward” because it occurred at the United Nations, a body that has singled out Israel for criticism for decades.  In a statement, Secretary of State John Kerry said the vote was guided by one principle: “To preserve the possibility of the two-state solution.”  MSW leaves out that this US abstention followed months of secret negotiations - it was no surprise! It was a response to continued Bibi settlement expansion decisions. (MSW thinks this is a Palestinian conspiracy - DUH??)

Assassination of a president is colossal, but must be paired with huge conspiracy collaborated with many bad actors.  No matter how uncomfortable people feels, extraordinary luck does happen.

With one lab and regulations/processes still tied up in the long halls of bureaucracy, I don't suspect that local dispensaries have had an opportunity to test their cannabis and manufactured cannabis products.  Hawai'i law requires that manufactured cannabis products be permitted and I have yet to see the DOH rules that provide those permits/permissible uses.  I don't think you give enough credit to locals, who have had to tap into their own resourcefulness for medical cannabis for - arguably - a great many decades.

That's just how the conservative mind works.  Single-payer is the only answer, not selling insurance across state lines, not deregulation, not TORT reform but single-payer. There's a reason nobody anywhere in the world has ever said, """"let's base our healthcare system on the American model"""".  Conservatives and conservatism are the reason that America has the most inefficient healthcare system in the world. It's a system the conservative insists we retain.

Initially, he was dubious about the value of the protest (which we parents were unaware of), so when he asked his father and me to sign the permission slip (which explicitly stated that the school didn't support it), we asked what had changed.  He said simply that he felt that the EarthGuardians were right that we need to think seriously about Climate Change and how we can work to improve our impact.  I told him that if his academic or attendance record were not sufficient, I would not support his choice, but they are solid, so I signed.   I agree with my son that we need to work harder to SEE the problems around us, and incrementally change our ways, and I am proud of him.

I've rarely in my life felt I was getting the whole news about anything - always felt I had to identify the slant/special interest (for one thing we are often reading press releases for governments, corporations and other groups), and then wonder what facts were missing or used out of context.  I'm very conscious of this due to how I was raised, others may not have thought in these terms, but still felt something was awry.  I'm telling everyone I know who's in a panic to relax, in a way this is all good, and after Trump is gone (sooner rather than later one hopes), a lot will come out in the wash....

0,"The fundamental misconception is that popularity is an important metric in determining the Church's success. The more popular the Church is the more souls it attracts, but if that popularity is at the expense of offering a fraudulent Christianity it diminishes its ability to reveal God truthfully. Mainline protestantism that embraces contraception and female clergy has demonstrated that these things do nothing to prevent shrinking. People embrace religion in a quest to be connected to an eternal constant, something certain and reliable. The more a religion changes it tells people that it does not possess a connection to that eternal constant and they will do just as well without it. Fidelity and constancy have served us well. Change and innovation are on every corner. The local country club can change its rules and reinvent itself as much as it want, we cannot.

Predictably, the usual-suspect warmongers in Washington are salivating over the prospect. A larger war would further distract American voters from our dead-in-the-water economy and the trillions wasted on unnecessary wars in the past 20 years.  2. No wonder theU.S. issued another warning about gas usage in Syria. The warning came only hours after a human rights group announced that the U.S. had killed nearly 500 innocent civilians, including dozens of children, in the past month ALONE. Of course, that sad announcement was virtually ignored by the corporate media, who never want to say a discouraging word about our national pastime -- waging unnecessary wars against people that Israel doesn't like.

If you are familiar with the president's business practices dating back to the 1970s - 1980s, loyalty was a precondition of employment.  This president does not tolerate people who say """"but, sir"""".  Acolytes unable to keep subordinates in line are also targeted for surgical removal.

The program was based on the well-established executive-branch authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in setting enforcement priorities. Rather than grant legal status, DACA simply deferred enforcement action against immigrants who met certain qualifications and permitted them to work lawfully in the meantime. And despite Sessions’s suggestion that President Barack Obama departed from established precedent in creating DACA, the practice of granting deferred action has been formally recognized as within the executive branch’s authority since the Reagan administration. http://tinyurl.com/ybc6cf9e

Some businesses fight the measure because it applies only to some and puts them at a disadvantage relative to the untaxed competing companies.  So to make an informed decision, we must assume that we consumers collectively will pay the bill.  The next question, given that we will pay the bill, is whether we want to give up our earned money to the state government for whatever purpose.  Keep in mind that this tax is extremely regressive.  The poor will pay a higher proportion of their income to this tax than the wealthy.  Other states have honest sales taxes that do not pretend to tax corporations.  These states often exclude necessities like food thereby mitigating the impact on the poor.  Measure 97 does not exclude necessities making its impact on the poor extreme.  In deciding, don't believe in the lie that we will not pay.

0,"The most egregious announcement was that Trump has decided “that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury. This way it is the American people who will profit.” Trump is simply setting up a funnel for foreign government donations to the government. Since that funnel runs through his hotel, it boosts the brand value of his hotel and, thus, Trump. It doesn’t prevent diplomats from choosing to stay in his hotel to curry favor with him. It will still flatter him, because he flatters easily. Also, we will never know if he even donates the money, because he doesn’t provide proper accounting documentation for anything, and it’s not clear how “foreign government payments” would be separately accounted for anyway. It’s a joke idea that does nothing and is stupid, and people will applaud it. This is a recurring theme in his life, which is unfortunately now ours, too.

More often than not, incumbents are re-elected because their constituents are happy with them.  And there are plenty of examples where election outcomes show that money doesn't buy votes. (Harry Kim, Kaniela Ing, David Ige).  This article is a prime example of irresponsible, lazy journalism that sends an inaccurate message to the public.

0,"LifeoftheLay, you may be surprised that there are a lot of pro-life people here, they just disagree with HOW to reduce the number of abortions. Believe it or not, abortion is down under President Obama! Perhaps because of healthcare options, or other programs that help the family. I happen to be one of those that do not impose my beliefs on others in a pluralistic society. We also have freedom of religion, and not everyone agrees with Catholic views, for example a Jewish family, I have read have different opinions on when life begins. If we value freedom of religion in this Country, we need to accept that there are other ways to encourage birth than to change laws. A candidate that supports the family, maternity leave, pre-school programs, healthcare, etc... will ultimately help reduce abortion. Isn't that your goal?

You see why we need to finish the revolution that started in the 1960's. Because when miscreants like Ronald Reagan, all the fanatic religious evangelists like Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority, Brian Mulroney in Canada, attacked everything the boomers accomplished in the 60's and 70's, most of them were married and unfortunately did not fight back. Generation X was too timid to carry on with the move towards democracy, equality, inclusiveness, and an economy that works for all. Thus all the elitist institutions and corrupted dysfunctional democracy we are burdened with today in North America, with all its religious divisions causing so much trouble, drifting ever further to the right wing where militarism, corporatism, fascism, and religion march in lock step keeping the people down.

It would have, but for the ill will directed to its implementation and use by the Republican Senate and House.  By solving systemic problems such as out of control insurance companies applying untoward rate increases and fragmented and uneven application between states, it could be fixed so that its promise would be fulfilled and function just as well as it did in Massachusetts under Mitt Romney.

I'd be surprised if any of the kids stick with the Church past confirmation based on your description.  I wouldn't want my kids in such a parish.  How's your track record of producing vocations?  The pastoral approach you describe is not new, but it has resulted in 80% of my extended family falling away from God and His Church.  We all descended from one devout set of church-going grandparents.  Today, failed liberal pastoral practices has led to abandonment and apostasy.

0,"Thank you Mark. Vick Vickers will be disappointed and of course the shill wavebuster, but other than that, I can't think of anyone. We are all still trying to recover from the peachy union contracts you gave out for union votes and can't get close to recovering our health premiums that were supposed to go down.  Thanks again, we can't afford democrats here.

And the post that never gets old: """"These Oilbertan creeps all voted for the Cons. We owe them nothing.""""

0,"The most revealing numbers, that capture the factors you mention, are life expectancy for women, for men and infant mortality rates. By those measures we have dropped over the years. In 2015 Canada's Infant mortality rate was 4.9/1000 or 28th overall. In 1980 we were 8th overall. In 2015 we were 9th in female life expectancy and 8th for male life expectancy, in 1980 we were 3rd. We have slipped any way you measure it.
