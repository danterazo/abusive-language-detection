he is not NisarKand because Beh-Nam is a Tajik and NisarKand an Awghan, an ethnic Pashtune. Dear Admins, plz check that out also his IPs. They are two different User. While NisarKand and DilbarJan are one and the same User and a nationalistic one but Beh-Nam has nothing to do with such activities. DilbarJan(/NisarKand) claimed he would helping Taliban but since Beh-Nam is a Persian and the Taliban were looking for cleansing Tajiks who could he be NisarKand self since Dilbar is allready NisarKand!? Plz dear Admins, unblock him. Beh-Nam is for a long time on Wikipedia and he didn´t do sth bad either against any nations nor against any User or any articles. The admins of Wikipedia now banned two or three of Tajiks who were one o the important ones here at least they were the sole Tajiks who were active.

I do not see how Guru Nanak """"founded"""" Sikhism
Nanak is the first of the ten Sikh gurus, but that does not mean that he founded it.  As the word is usually understood, founding a religion means separating it from the other ones, and Nanak definitely never separated his followers from Muslims or Hindus.  In fact, many of Nanak's practices were things that were eventually forbidden once Sikhism was founded - for example, fasting and going on pilgrimages.  I believe that it was the last Guru who separated Sikhism from Islam and Hinduism.    """,0

What if they're just really bad at keeping secrets?  Look, I'm not going to point out a conspiracy theory here.  I'm not sure if there's any real significance to the Bilderberg Group, at least in terms of the New World Order and all that stuff.  Doesn't it maybe just seem slightly awkward though that the contents of the meetings are kept entirely secret?  I understand that there is tons of information which is kept classified that we don't know about.  However, it's different when you have so many prominent figures attending the meeting.  We don't know anything about their purpose and the attendees are told to keep quiet.  It makes it seem even more suspicious when they get extremely pissed off for even stepping one inch onto the property outside of where the meeting is being held.  What on earth are they afraid of?  Why do they need so many police to keep guard when almost no one knows what's going on inside of the building?  The meetings are almost classified themselves.

"There was much continuity with the earlier English church (Dioceses were reorganised, and new ones created, but much of the senior clergy remained the same, abbeys were dissolved, but some were raised to the status of cathedrals, at Peterborough for instance the last abbot became the first bishop), and under Henry the church retained a largely catholic identity.  It was under Edward that a more Protestant character appeared, due to those who dominated his governemtn (edward was under age).  Of course under Mary the pendulum swung (violently) back the other way, and Elizabeth's position attemoted to reach a compromise.  To some extent that broke down under Charles I, and of course under the Commonwealtha presbyterian polity was adopted, but with the Restoration returned the bishops.  High Church and Low Church had slightly different connotations then, and what we would now recognise as Anglo-Catholicism emerged in the 19th century (along with more evangelical groups such as the Clapham Set).

"No need to apologize.  My editorial comments are sometimes more curt or critical than they should be, and this quite naturally elicits a strong reaction.  

The problem of ground pressure was well-understood by the US Army Ordnance Dept. during WWII. I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T-34's lower ground pressure, and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept. to achieve similar results.  In fact, designers of both tanks were simply reacting to the conditions imposed by the European battlefield, and the Russian's worked out the solution while the American's were still getting the M4 ready for battle in the sands of N. Africa. 

Keep in mind that the relatively few engagements involving T-34s and M4s were fought mostly at relatively close ranges.  This helped mask the penetration problems of the 76mm HVAP (It was only marginally better than the AP shot round.), and led to a generalized misunderstanding of the tank's effectiveness against its Russian counterpart. I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea.  In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps, it was Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair.  A long time staffer, McNair was a genius at organization, but demonstrated very little understanding of, or for that matter, any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield.  Had he died a year earlier, we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans.  It would have made a difference.",0

 About Disputed ethnic origin of persians 

The papyri from Tebtunis record several sites in the Fayum, which appear to have been founded as ethnic communities in the third century BCE. These include the """"Village of the Syrians"""" (Syrôn kômê), """"Village of the Arabs"""" (Arabôn kômê) and Samareia, which contained a sizable Jewish population and was probably named after the city in Palestine. 

Although ethnic designations like Boeotian, Macedonian, Syrian, Arab and Jew probably refer to geographic origin, """"Persian"""" proves problematic. Its precise origin or significance is disputed. In the early Ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with Greek names functioning in a Greek context; although they enjoy a privileged status, they are counted separately from Greeks in tax lists. In late Ptolemaic and Roman contracts, """"Persian of the epigonê"""" refers to the legal status of a debtor who had waived certain personal rights in order to secure the collection of a debt.

Persians 
6 June 12 BCE
 
In this Demotic contract, summarized in Greek at the bottom, Pakemis son of Pakemis, acknowledges the loan of the dowry of his wife Tameische (Greek, Tameischis), daughter of Sokonopis, and promises to repay it. Here """"Persian"""" does not seem to indicate descent, but describes a man with the status of a debtor. In this example, the subject has an Egyptian personal name, but """"Persian of the epigonê"""" is just as frequently used to describe people with Greek names.

"This is total tripe!!  A bunch of brainwaahed, Glasweigian, nutters running down Goodison Rd does not prove a Catholic bias at EFC. Or, some loons in the Kop on a derby day.   Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. 

The split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.

Leeds University Study:-

Both of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.

The club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.

The story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.

The historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.

Houlding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.

However, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.

Another feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home",0
"WP:MOSMED is the Manual of Style for articles that come under any of the Medical categories. All medical-related articles have to comply to reach Good Article (GA) or above (hehe - I only found out about it at the second GA Review!).
Try typing 'Paul Bert' into the search box in the left column of any page and click the 'Search' button (rather than pressing Enter or clicking the Go button). You'll get the search results - the article Paul Bert is first, and Oxygen toxicity is fourth. If you click the Go button instead, you go direct to the article if it exists, otherwise you get the search results as before. Try the same test searching for 'Paul Bert effect'.
There is an article on Decompression sickness - we plan to tackle that after we have finished getting Nitrogen narcosis to GA. No need to mention those in Oxygen toxicity - although all of them are summarised in Scuba diving#Effects_of_breathing_high_pressure_gas.
The partial pressure of oxygen is the trigger for OxTox: that is found by multiplying the fraction of oxygen by the ambient pressure at the depth you're at. For example, air is 21% oxygen and the pressure at 50 metres is 6 bar. So you have a partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) of 0.21 x 6 = 1.26 bar. That's safe from CNS OxTox as it's never been observed at less than 1.3 bar. Divers may use gas mixtures different from air, however - take a look at Nitrox for more information.
It's my pleasure to try to explain where I can. I must admit it was a little mischievous of me to throw you in at the deep end on Oxygen toxicity . But believe me, the discipline needed to meet all the style requirements is a great learning experience and worth the effort.

Interestingly, Ray Franz writes (pg 385-386) about several letters he sent to his uncle after being disfellowshipped. He says he expected no reply and received none.

These subjects have been debated many times and a common compromise was reached months ago, which you appear clearly not interested in. Your selfishness in trying to destroy the hard work of others and their extensive debates on these matters is quite typical of many with your religious background (the blinkered view that any method is acceptable if it makes the JWs look good in the public eye). Censorship is not welcome here, especially when it has a blatant religious agenda and bias. You have failed to make a single point of valid criticism that has not been discussed at great length before (please go and read all 14 pages of talk) as you might start to understand why you are being so unreasonable and astoundingly narrow-minded. Wikipedia is here for factual information, not public relation promotions for religious sects; if you want that then go to the Watchtower's website.

Science (from Latin scientia, meaning """"knowledge"""") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe.""""... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions.""""—J. L. Heilbron ( ) In an older and closely related meaning, """"science"""" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.

In modern usage, """"science"""" may refer as well to a way of pursuing or producing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. Especially in the anglophone world """"science"""" is often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe.Oxford English Dictionary The German approach of """"Wissenschaften"""" in the tradition of Humboldtian science and Humboldtian education ideal is more generic and includes all sort of scholarly endeavours with philosophy still as a common denominator. The The Two Cultures the German Positivism dispute and the US science wars refer to ongoing controversies about the role of natural sciences and the humanities. The controversies refered as well to the longstanding dominance of male White Anglo-Saxon Protestant scholars in e.g. US universities and the use of """"Dead white European men"""" as role models. It has lead to various attempts, as in gender studies to involve e.g. female or minority perspectives in science and as well a backslash defending the important role of the classics.Bernard Knox, The Oldest Dead White European Males and Other Reflections on the Classics (1993) (reprint, W.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

1/ [edit] Tinky-Winky controversy
One of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, was the focus of a still hinted-at controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's purse (although he was first """"outed"""" by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to The Face).

2/ A February, 1999 article in the National Liberty Journal, published by Jerry Falwell, warned parents that Tinky could be a hidden homosexual symbol, saying """"he is purple—the gay pride color, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle—the gay pride symbol.""""

2(and a half!) A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., who licenses the characters in the United States, said it was just a magic bag. """"The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish.""""

3/ In an incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said """"I got a gun"""". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., claimed the toy acutally said """"Again, Again"""". [3]

(It took me some time to write this as you may have already added stuff, or there could be stuff already there I missed in the first place)

May I.....  Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) 

You have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced """"welder"""", save for I'm sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven't been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  

HOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I've read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can't stand things which don't come up in google counts.

The list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of """"authoritative"""" sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a """"school of thought"""" on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything """"so they say"""".  

X-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.

A highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.

This largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki's undoing.   

From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating """"duty-cycle"""") to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a 'shortness' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to """"wick"""" (conduct) heat away from the p",0

Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

 Process definitions 

As a Wikipedia user with no specific knowledge of comic collecting, I find the Process table confusing. It is stated that CGC grades material from 0.5 to 10, then Definitions defines what A, P, S, M and E denote, but below that is given an example grading """"VF/NM 9.0"""". I'm going to induce that NM is near mint, but am I to guess what VF is or why it is there? 121.45.247.24  

Good point. The numbers correspond to more traditional descriptive grades such as """"fine"""", """"very fine"""", """"near mint"""", and """"mint"""". I've added a sentence explaining that and a link to the chart on their website. Also, I removed the """"VF/NM"""" part from the example. Does that make it more comprehensible?   

 Missing an obvious and major criticism 

One of the most obvious criticisms is that the CGC practice is the ultimate objectification and de-artification of the comic/magazine being graded, because it is sealed permanently and will never be read/viewed again except for the cover. All of the story and interior art are essentially lost forever for all intents and purposes.  One might as well just encase it in Lucite like a bug in amber. — ''''''   Talk⇒ ʕ(Õلō)ˀ  Contribs. """,0

 Dear soldier of the Wikipedia neo-nazi/communist dictatorship 
What the hell are you tlaking about. I did not re-creat any article about the formal Australian Worker's Party formaly known as the New Communist Party of Australia. I think you are high on the lies told by storm front. You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front
"""" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old.""""

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis. Once more the nazis made some thing up to make them selvs look better and sound better than other people.""",1
"""The person who said that it was hit by a missile was the brother of someone on the airplane. Clearly he is going to be emotional and not a worthwhile source. The fact of the matter is that the first patrol to come across the wreckage was asked to investigate because the Joint Defense Operations Center on base detected the sound of the plane crashing into the ground. Bear in mind that the sound detector is used to listen for mortars and would hear a """"missile"""" hitting the aircraft. Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen. My section was the second section to be called up to respond to the crash. The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck. There is absolutely no way that the enemy could spot the plane in the fog and shoot it down. Shooting down an aircraft is not an easy task for insurgents in the first place, shooting down a plane in that thick of fog, with a """"missile?"""" (insurgents don't have missiles), and having a """"missile"""" that doesn't make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash """"1.5 miles"""" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing. You seem pretty smug and sure of yourself but the fact of the matter is that all you did was read reports from unreliable Russian websites and fancy yourself with conspiracy theories. Keep diluting yourself with you're ridiculous conclusions, you'll stay an idiot forever.

 Explanation of my recent edits 

Removing bolding and external links within article per WP:MOS. Only first word of section titles should be capitalized, and NCNM should not be placed on section headings (each section is about the subject of the article).

Removal of peacock terms and redundant phrasing, """"extensive, unique, geared to, in its course offerings, more universal, opens numerous, in which students are immersed, designed for students with a special affinity, wanting a more streamlined graduate experience, fully"""". If actually extensive needs a RS that describes it that way, likewise with unique or a description of how its unique. Geared to unless we are talking about gears this is marketing. In its course offerings is redundant. More universal with an explanation this is unnecessary, however universality is a pretty large if vague claim. Students are immersed, describe how program is immersive provide a RS that says it is notable for that. Designed for students with a special affinity, designed for students is a given for a school and special affinity sounds like peacock for interest in. Wanting a more streamlined graduate experience is marketing peacock speak for shorter/smaller course of study. Fully (accredited) is assumed if only partially accredited that would be spelled out. 

Removed wikilink on word school to article Medical school NCNM is not a medical school as described in target article.

Adding ref improve tag: the entire Academic programs section has only the two refs supporting accreditation, the NCNM clinic section is completely unsourced as is the Accreditations and associations section and the NCNM history section. 

I placed 3 citation needed tags on some statements that definitely need references. These are very specific in addition to the article in general needing improved references.

Additional proposed edits:

I think expertise in """"with an expertise in natural medicine"""" should be removed if it can't be supported with a reference. Expertise is substantial claim for education and training only. I am not sure what """"a holistic Chinese medicine education in Western medical sciences"""" means. """"Since its founding, NCNM has sought to preserve and convey the classical modalities of naturopathy and honor the principles that guide naturopathic care:"""" could be rephrased, """"to preserve and convey the classical modalities and honor the guiding principles of naturopathy:"""" if that preserves the meaning. """"The college is alma mater to over 2,000 alumni"""" is redundant if your an alumni it's your alma mater.

But I think I will write to the foundation and find out who their legal counsel because what he has written against Canaen is pure indelible libel. Whereas mediation is a waste of time, the foundation will jump if they start receiving legal letters requesting user contact details. They have to be law.

Ive posted a dispute tag in this area, because I dont believe in general that oil is used for capacitor cooling.
Quote from manufacturer literature:

'#  Why are GAEP high voltage capacitors oil-filled?
 
Highly insulating oil is used to suppress partial discharges (corona), increase the dielectric strength, and increase the effective permittivity (dielectric constant) of the capacitor dielectric. Oil-filled film capacitors have high energy density in comparison with other types of capacitors used at high voltage, such as ceramic capacitors. Different types of oils are used with different types of capacitor dielectric and electrode designs.

"Mandarins of Ontario Regional Government 

I wanted to start an Article listing the Top Mandarins of Ontario Regional Government and when I started it was shot down for things like copyright violations or that I was somehow pushing a POV by simply listing information, or claiming I was posting a Bio of non-notable people.

I don't see what is wrong with making up such a list. It would basically list only the top Mandarins, the CAO, the Commissioner of Business Services, the Commissioner of Public Works and the Regional Solicitor. This would result in a list of say 24 individuals and can list where the came from to expand the job-stub of Wiki and provide interesting and useful reference information about who is who in government in Ontario Regions. This would not POV anything and simply be a source of information about who and how people get these jobs by listing their past jobs in government positions. Once up it can be expanded and be kind of like a hierarchy of command and control positions. No Bio's on them.

Can I have some reasoned comments here on why you people would object to such an article of pure reference information from being created on Ontario's regional government structure?",0

 Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches 

I am not a writer or an editor, so I am not sure how to approach the correction of the page, nor am I a genealogist or a theologian, so I'm not really schooled in the subject matter, so I could be wrong about this.
  In the article under the heading of Eastern Orthodox Church and other Eastern Churches, it says """"However, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, marriages of affinity that produce children who are closer genetic relatives than legal are also not permitted (unless the genetic relationship does allow marriage between those children).  For example, two siblings may not marry two other siblings because legally their children will be cousins, but genetically they'll be half siblings.  On the other hand, two siblings may marry two cousins.""""
  Although I am not sure what the laws are in the EOC regarding marriage of first cousins, I believe the example given is in error.  Half siblings are children who share one parent, either the father or the mother.  I believe that their children would in fact be cousins in two lines.  However, according to the Wikipedia page on siblings, two of the siblings in the scenario were identical twins, this would in fact make their children genetically equivalent to half siblings, as well as cousins.
  As for the second example, of two siblings marrying two cousins, their children would be first cousins in one line, and second cousins in the other line.
  Again, I have never formally studied genealogy, and have no references, so don't take this as an affront, but I think I am correct.

Prodding the tiger
Please sir, I didn't mean it. The smoking was one o' them joke-thingies (""""Descartes? Whatever he was smoking, I want some...""""). 

But the language thing wasn't (tho it probably wasn't v competent either). My understanding of language issues is nothing like yours. But I do feel that there is no difference between languages and dialects except the issue of power (interrelated with codifying the language). And the language politics in Zimbabwe are complicated, I think even more so than RSA. South Africa (as far as my puny knowledge goes) has gone from appalling but simple language values to a situation where the politics and importance of language are openly discussed and the horrors of the past give a very clear marker of what to avoid. Zimbabwe, on this as on so many things, Won't Talk about it: if you've ever doubted the value of the TRC, take a look what happens when you don't have one. 

Btw, going direct to Mark is the right thing: I've been trying to get my head round your language stuff with the intention of passing it to him, as there's no way I would trust myself to incorporate most of that without supervision from you both. But the older bits keep getting submerged by the new (and by trivial corrections to C11th philosophers which unaccountably go nuclear... but that wasn't you).

Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences”. User:Bobrayner wipes out “surplus economics”, “archaeology”, “sociology” and “other social sciences” so that the  sentence now reads: “Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology” (in that case, it should really be “AND economic anthropology”). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a “quote farm” or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that “For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below).” There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out “the statement that “Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion.” For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence “The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour” and adds, “In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour.” But this doesn’t even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed,” then User:Bobrayner changes that to “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has",0
"More efficient answer 

What you wrote in this edit blindsided me so completely that it was hard to understand where you were coming from and so to write an efficiently worded reply.  It's not easy for me to grasp that there could be such a point of view as the one you seem to express.  But having pondered it for some time since you wrote this, I think I can attempt a clear, short, and direct reply.  You wrote:
 
 Sorry if this seems stupid, but I don't know why this article exists. Do we also need to prove that 4 is bigger than 3? That 50 is bigger than 1.2? No.
 
The facts are:
 22/7, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1429.
 It is trivial to demonstrate that fact.
 π, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1416.
 That 3.1429 > 3.1416 is a triviality, not worth an article.
 BUT: The fact that π is approximately 3.1416 can be seen only be first doing quite a lot of work, some of it relying on methods that are relatively sophisticated by comparison to the bare statement that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter, or the like.
 By contrast, the proof given in the article shows that 22/7 > π in a way that is quick and simple, unlike all the work needed to see that π is approximately 3.1416, so you can see that 22/7 > π while skipping all the labor involved in seeing that π is about 3.1416.
 ...and the method by which it is done, in addition to being so short and simple, is elegant, immediately startling, and potentially enlightening in that you immediately wonder if it fits into some larger pattern that would give you insights not otherwise available.
 
You almost seem to treat the fact that π is approximately 3.1416 as if it were self-evident, rather than something that can be seen only at considerable expense.",0

 Horrendous Inaccuracies

 Detailed chronology - 2 

Now that the legalities are covered...

This is massive material. It tends to overwhelm the article, which is now bloated to three times the recommended size of a Wikipedia article. I think we need to summarize here and factor out to separate articles, maybe one for each year.
While clearly well researched, the material is quite POV in the selection of what it covers. I'm firmly on the side of the Republic  one of the first things I ever learned to say in Spanish was """"Sueño y una ametralladero y Franco se va paseo,  but this Wikipedia articles are not the place for partisan polemic. A chronology this detailed should also include the anti-Catholic atrocities by anarchists and other supporters of the Republic. This doesn't.
The material is written in indifferent English. Right now, I'm engaged in a copy edit, which is being made difficult by the size of this article and the current miserable state of the servers.
I do not think it is appropriate in Wikipedia to repeatedly refer to the Nationalists as """"the Fascists"""".  Would I call them that in my own writing outside Wikipedia? Sure. And someone on the Right would probably use different words than """"Republicans"""", """"legitimate government"""", etc. in his/her own writing.

 Heavily biased section named as Death on 18 August 1945 

The bias in the section named as Death on 18 August 1945, is very much conspicuous, very much unbecoming of Wikipedia. There is a literary effort to establish unconfirmed events in the veil of so-called """"scholarly opinion"""".  It appears the page is intentionally silent on the report of the last commission and the inquiry commission by Taiwan Government, the country in which the air crash was alleged to take place. It is another matter, but quite relevant, that Taiwan itself has denied this crash having ever taken place.  But what is most irritating is the last paragraph, where there is a emphasis on shock, disbelief at so-called death in India, which gives a lead into a suspicion that everything (even an Inquiry Commission report perhaps!) are all babies of this disbelief.  There are pictures like Renkoji temple, or newspapers reports published at that time which unsuccessfully try to uphold the the death theory, but keeping silent on the other theories, increases the suspicion of a using this page as a tool to publish own opinions rather than information.

Hopefully there's some more info around now, especially with this by-election in the works. (I had a look at the by-election page and fixed up the candidates table a little - it was listing candidates of the Democrats, Secular Party and SEP, none of which are registered in Victoria.

Vandalism question
This page seems to get an unusually high incidence of vandalism.  Normally, a page has to be either a featured article or a very public and controversial topic to be vandalized this regularly.  Any hypotheses about why this page is so regularly attacked?   (talk) 
Pretty sure """"Pulley"""" is British slang for Handjob. I've heard it a few places across the web. I'm assuming that's it's consistently  vandalized.   
Theory of operation
I added a theory of operation section, and used two of the pulley system images from the original article. I have removed the simplest compound pulley image, because its practical implementation is not different from the diagram, which is the case for the other two - they are different from the diagrams. I also removed the """"historical images of pulleys"""" because it didn't seem to add much, without an explanation. Maybe it could go back in under a history section?  

how about the diameter of the wheel?   doesn't that have something to do with the force necessary to lift an object?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Nope, nothing.  The forces on either side of the pulley are the same regardless of the radius of the wheel.  Okay, actually that's for a theoretical pulley.  A real pulley will suffer some slight amount of friction between the fibers of the rope as it goes around the pulley.  A larger diameter pulley will deform the rope less resulting in slightly less friction.  But that is a miniscule effect compared to the normal forces used on the pulley.   (talk) 

 Bicycle chain pulley? 

Is it correct or incorrect to call the non-driven wheels in a modern bicycle rear derailleur pulleys?  The chain is kept in place by its side-plates and small """"near-teeth"""" in the pulley, rather than by fitting in a groove.  This particular application also involves no mechanical advantagejust tension adjustment.  Are there other applications where chains and wheels function as cables and pulleys? 
In the context of the six simple machines, yes, a derailleur would be considered a pulley - specifically a """"class 1"""" pulley with a mechanical advantage of 1.  The fact that the """"groove"""" is on the chain rather than on the wheel is a minor variant.  The definition of something as a simple machine is based on how the force is transformed as the force does work.  Any situation where the force is being carried through tension and where the direction is changed would probably count as a pulley.   (talk) 
Sheldon Brown had these entries in his glossary: -  
Idler: """"An idler is a pulley or roller that does not produce any mechanical advantage, nor transmit power to a shaft. Idlers are used to lead a chain around a bend (as in short wheelbase recumbents), or to take up slack in a drive chain (as in a tandem chain tensioner, or the pulleys in a derailer.""""
Chain pulleys: """"Most rear derailers use two pulleys in a spring-loaded cage to regulate the tension of the chain as it runs over different sized sprockets. The upper pulley is called the """"jockey"""" pulley, the lower one is the """"tension"""" pulley.""""
Jockey pulley: """"The upper pulley on a rear derailer. This is the pulley that actually guides the chain from one sprocket to another. Shimano jockey pulleys are designed with a """"Centeron®"""" mechanism that allows a small amount of sidewards motion to compensate for imprecise index adjustment.""""

 Additional Information Needed 

I think information should be added to this article to recognize a """"sheave"""" as a type of pulley.  I'm probably not the right person to add this, but I do know that they are commonly used in oceanic applications suspended from an A-frame on a ship and also for oil drilling.   Tired_Angel

Notability of City journalist directory
 A tag has been placed on City journalist directory requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    """,0
"Around Wisconsin, they don't make themselves very well-known at all until Indian Summer kicks in late September to middle October, and that's when they start to swarm. The article indicates that this is when they start to invade houses for hibernation, but the swarms also occur outside as well during this time, and you would think they'd be heading indoors when it gets colder, not hotter.

The reverter

E tha to ksanapo! Whats the problem with that. Read Hammond: """"An interesting feature of this culture is that it has been found only to the north of the Shkumbi valley; that is it is concentrated within the cantons of Mirdite and Mati (between Shtish-Tufina near Tirana and Dalmace in the north), and that it has outlying pockets at the north end of Lake Ochrid, at Golaj in Albanian Kosove, and at Mijele at the northern end of Lake Scodra. Thus the ambit of this culture is precisely in the region which we have identified on literary grounds as that of 'Arbana' and 'Albeigne'. The conclusion seems to be clear that the people of this region - known no doubt as Arbanoi and Albanoi - developed in this mountainous terrain, with many peaks of five and six thousand feet, a culture of their own which was distinct from those of the Serbian state in Zeta to the north, the First Bulgarian Empire in the lakeland area, and the Byzantine province of Epirus Nova."""" and you know that he says that Albanoi and Arbanoi are the current Albanians.

Sanctioning from a bunch of bigots means nothing to me.

Since you decided to step in and harass me too I have to share new research finding with you as well:
90% of men are gay 100% of women are gay Rape and incest is an epidemic All races, cultures, nationalities, groups, and religions are secretly racist Most women are secretly sexist Drug and alcohol abuse is abundant Dyslexia affects 90% of the population and is commonly undiagnosed and treatable Mental illness is commonly undiagnosed and incurable Sociopaths need to be separated from normal society
Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how.
Women can have a muscular orgasm if they repeatedly squeeze the vaginal muscle used to urinate.
Secret racism and secret sexism can be avoided by simply vocalizing the secret.""",1

"Ok, in summary, Mark Twain is not a WP:RS because there are accurate estimates of concomitant population, which is contradictory to your earlier statement that There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time.  This reference and others like it breech WP:RS by not conforming to the subsection Beware false authority

Authority of authors   
Prefer authors with an established reputation in the field where Wikipedia uses them for reference. 

Mark Twain is a satirist and a writer of fiction, not a respected demographer.

These references are also in breech of 

Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence

Claims not supported or claims that are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community. Be particularly careful when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them. 

There is no conspiracy to silence these claims.  This account is problematic because Twain's work seems to indicate that the 350,000 people do not exist in Twain's time, or that there are much less people than 350,000 living in Palestine.  Verified and peer-reviewed sources indicate that there were 350,000 people in the area concomitant to Twain's visit.  Thats what needs to be said in a section on demographics, not the musings of a satirist and fiction author.

Self-published sources

Main article: Wikipedia:VerifiabilityA self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise Twain's work is also in breech of this portion of WP:RS as well.  His accounts cannot be considered verified or subject to any form of independent fact-checking.  He is also not a well-known, professional researcher writing within their field of expertise.

If we were doing original research or if we did not have good population estimates, then this information would be valuable. Since There are no accurate estimates of population at the time so laregely scholars can relate to the observations of travelers at the time'' is clearly wrong and we do have accurate estimates of population at the time, it is clear that we need to use these and expunge the article of all non-scholarly sources, including the Herbert Samuel link I contributed earler.",0

 RFC 

I didn't say the sockpuppet issue wasn't relevant, I said it couldn't be proven and if he insists he's not JB it should be dropped.  The stuff with JB happened around the time I started on Wikipedia and I saw a little bit of it and have to agree that they have similar editing styles.  However, if we can't prove that Booyaka is JB, then we have to judge Booyaka's behavior on its own merits.  If, on the other hand, we can prove that Booyaka is JB, then Booyaka can be blocked.  

As for """"However when Booyaka replaced the tags and ignored the notes on the edit summary - that's when it became vandalism.""""  No, it's still a content dispute.  It's an inappropriate action, but not vandalism.  Read WP:Vandalism, especially the part about what vandalism is not.  I would call replacing the tags """"Bullying or Stubbornness"""".  Not right, not good, but not vandalism either.  Accusing someone of vandalism when they aren't vandalising takes a bad situation and makes it worse.  

You said, """"There are limited editors in Australia and New Zealand, so the obtaining of third party sources is hindered severely in the time sense.""""  I see that, hence my advice to him to go easy on the AFDs and just use {{unreferenced}}.  Not that I think he'll take my advice.  However, there is a growing movement to speedy delete unsourced articles, see Wikipedia:Speedy deletion criterion for unsourced articles (which you might want to comment on).

Just remember to be civil to other editors, to always cite your sources, and to write articles from a neutral point of view, and you should be good to go.

Wikipedia is a huge website; with  articles, it is the single biggest encyclopedia in the world. Additionally, there are thousands of policy and process pages, so it can be a bit overwhelming, even to experienced users. When I was new, I found the Tutorial particularly helpful. You might also want to check out the glossary. This page serves as our library reference desk, where you can ask nearly any question imaginable.

The Featured Articles and Good Article pages are good places to look for some of our most well-written and comprehensive articles. On the other end of the spectrum, we have thousands of articles that require cleanup of some sort, so feel free to help out.

""":::::::::Out of a hundred image requests or submissions, I may get one question about attribution - its a pretty rare thing.  Much more often, I see """"yeah, Wikipedia can use it"""" or some other statement that doesn't confirm the license the way we need.  If you don't wish to explain the problem up front, there's no reason you can't explain it if asked and point to the caption guideline for further information.  It looks like the discussion has been mentioned on the village pump as well, so hopefully some other viewpoints on the situation can help the discussion. 

Personally, I agree with the general usage, like I said, I think its much of the same reason that the history is a separate page and text submission isn't credited in the article either - accessibility, readability and standardization.  I don't see a compelling reason yet to change the guidelines - in this case, there was another free image available without the caption concern.  I imagine there will be cases that it would be difficult to get another free image, but in my experience, most contributors to Wikipedia are willing to abide by the policies and guidelines when someone takes the time to educate them.    babelfish

An example would be your addition about the number of wells cut off by the barrier (I can't find it now and only recall it somewhat). While some of your addition I remember as strongly POV, there were important facts contained within it such as that the Israel government says that no wells have been cut off. If I remember correctly, Ramallite simply reverted which is not appropriate. Another example I see is part of your recent edit. Some of it I think is POV such as implying all Israelis agree in the first statement, whether you meant """"Israel the government"""" or """"Israel the citizens"""" is unclear. One thing that irked me was Ramallite's reversion of the following addition: """"The Israeli government states that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent the infiltration of terrorists, and that any hardship imposed on Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism."""" This I believe is completely true and you are attributing it so it should be easy to verify. The current version: """"Although the Israeli government has said that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent attacks and that any hardship to Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism, the barrier's opponents say the barrier is the de facto future border of the State of Israel."""" is argumentative and implies the first statement is false and last statement is true as a result of the conditional """"Although"""" which implies contradiction. This is far more POV than your addition. Considering that he says he will continue to work on the articles where you have the dispute I would be inclined to oppose the nomination based on this alone. Additionally he seems condescending towards you, and I'm sure it is difficult to ignore that considering his edits and stay civil (though staying civil would probably help the dispute). I sympathize but will not vote.

Your request for rollback

Hi JohnSRoberts99.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!  雲‍水 """,0

I for one think the Greeks have had one of their great patriotic moments unjustly marketed to ignorant teenagers, like a cheap McDonald's burger.

If art is free, then certainly the wind may and must blow in all directions, just as much as a coin may have two sides.

The problem is not only with the sections concerning """"Controversy about media coverage"""", the major problem is that many major points about the Greek debt crisis are missing in the lead and the article, even though it consists of >100 pages. This is addressed in 
 section #4 - """">100 pages, but still main points missing?""""
 section #5 - """" Why did Greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis? """"
 section #6 -  """" POV / LEAD debate """"
Two weeks ago, I proposed in this section #4 to have the main points at least in summary style in the lead (as important ones are not even in the article)
Just let's only take the first point listed in #4, being joining the Euro without sufficient financial convergence and competitiveness in the summary list of causes for the Greek debt crisis. It is the major single and early root cause for the Greek debt crisis. Without this root cause Greece could technically not have had this debt crisis because it could always have printed itself out of every debt volume as they did before with the drachma. But this cause is missing in the 100 WP pages and in the WP lead. The current lead only lists normal problems like """"structural weaknesses"""" and """"recessions""""  (even though it is clear that Greece faced those normal problems for decades and always solved them with high drachma inflation if needed) - so without naming the root cause there is no cause for the Greek debt crisis.
What happened after I proposed to have the main points in the article (at least in the lead as a summary) and also invited everybody to add/change/delete from my proposed the main point list? There were strong opponents working in a coordinated action, threatening to fight any significant change, saying one can not summarize a Greek debt crisis, saying """"Greek interests [need to have] a prominence"""") when describing the debt crisis in WP, saying they will not let other editors summarize it, and so on. So we have almost 100 new pages in the talk section, and main points about the lemma not in the article (like it was during the last 5 years)

= More a fault of interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

In your answer, one notices very well that you still made an error, because you fix yourselves on the imaginary scientific value of Rognes or of the americains, by hating the objective value of the other authors and in particular of Lehrer.  To better explain you the taxonomic situation of the kind Bengalia s. str., I request from you do not consider that I insult certain characters of current taxonomy and to see reality exactly exposed by me. 

No author who occupied himself more or less tangentially with Bengaliidae, admits that Bengalia testacea  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  Only Rognes, which copied Sabrosky (1999:62), which knew this group of dipterous in same measurement as Rognes, wrote (with the collaboration of bibliographical and nonscientific impostors:  Neal L Evenhuis and F.C. Thompson) that this type is the nomen nudum  B. testacea  indicated by Duponchel (1842)(?!).  Thus, which makes N.L Evenhuis, J. E. O' Hara, T. Pape and A. C. Pont are only of copy and to transcribe exactly the silly things of Sabrosky, without any proof or analyze scientific.  Moreover, because these authors are good friends with Rognes, it also added """" Valid genus [ tests  Rognes (2006:467) ] """", but not validates species-type.  But, can you say which tests was made by Rognes?,  who knows nothing on Bengaliidae, which made the most stupid silly things in its work, which does not know the morphological terminology of their genitalia male, which mixes the drawings of the authors for the different species to make its new taxa, which makes the photography of the microscopic preparations of the species studied by Lehrer and deposited in the Natural history museum of London and which affirms that those are clean taxonomic imaginations?  Don't you believe my assertions?  Then I recommend to you to read, for a good documentation of your encyclopaedia, work of Lehrer of his review Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2008(18):1-4;  2010(23):1-22 and 22-25; 2010(24):20-24 and 24-30;  2010(25):1-4 and work:  LEHRER & WEI, 2010, a new Eastern kind of the family Bengaliidae (Diptera) - Bull. Ploughshare ent.  Mulhouse, 66(2)21-25.  
Thus you can understand that Rognes is incomparable being unaware of, which wanted to make taxonomic """" revolutions """" with the language devoted to its handicapped pupils of the school of Stavanger (Norway) where it works and with the mystifications of literature and information.  Moreover, you can consider only the work of Evenhuis &Comp.;  of Zootaxa an authority in the taxonomy of Bengaliidae constitutes, because they never studied the species of the group and in particular ?, because all the authors, of Zumpt (1956) and until Lehrer (2010) consider that Bengalia labiata  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  If you want to mislead the readers, you are free to depreciate your Wikipedia.

 Hi, Calpez. I really need you to back up these assertions, because as far as I can tell, none of these teams exist at all. The main problem is that none of these places are """"nations"""" of any kind, so they can't possibly have """"national"""" teams. Just a few examples:

Thanks for you additions, and I hope you continue to contribute here, but I'm letting you know that I removed what you added for a couple of reasons.  First of all, the additions were from a very strong point-of-view (POV) and here in Wikipedia we strive to only add information which is from a Neutral Point of View.  Please read that policy if you have time and it might make things clearer.

Also, another problem with the addition is that it is almost a verbatim copy of this web page; we are not allowed to violate whatever copyright that site holds on the information.  Moreover, I think it should be clear that we should not directly add information from freemumia.com into Wikipedia, this web site will of course have a strong POV and a reason for writing what they do.

"""a liberal person's article that has personal blog criticism, and yet you haven't removed any of the criticism. There is clearly a quality difference between Media Matters analysis and Moorewatch.com, but nonetheless you seem fixated on one. Why is that?  

I am looking at an article that used to have criticism on it, but two user's pulled MM off and then removed the controversy section.  

I quote from WP:RS, """"The websites and publications of political parties and religious groups should be treated with caution, although neither political affiliation nor religious belief is in itself a reason not to use a source.""""

Sure I find lots of reasons.  But one of the biggest is your comment that """"Hannity is a moron.""""  It proves that you are biased and incapable of putting together a NPOV article. 

I asked for reasons why you consider it unreliable. Also I never insulted Hannity I added a link to well-traffic Hannity criticism site. Moreover, I told you this already and you still want to falsely claim I insulted Hannity. There is a discussion on Media Matters on WP:RS. Why you don't consider it reiable? Do you think those clips of Hannity speaking are fake?  

 Terri Schiavo 

During the Terri Schiavo controversy, two of Schiavo's nurses appeared on Hannity and Colmes to argue that Schiavo was not brain dead. Talk show host and actor Harry Shearer obtained a video tapeHannity and Colmes video where Hannity can be heard coaching the nurses on how to respond to Alan Colmes's questions. He told them to respond """"I'm just here to tell you what I saw"""", no matter what Colmes asked. After the segment, Hannity can be heard saying """"We got the points out...But you did great, both of you"""". Should this be included?

Don't blindly revert things like fixing fair use images. I see no reason to discuss Fred Phelps on this page. He is more than adequately discuessed on his own page. In fact, I see no reason for most of this page to exist. Are the controvercies notable at all?  

I agree. Moreover, if the reader wants to learn more they go to the footnote. All material Getaway added is on there.  
Well, if the criticism of Media Matters is going to be on the page, which I don't agree many of these so-called controversies should even be there, but if it is going to be there then the Phelps's Democrat, liberal background needs to be pointed out because Media Matters is attempting to argue that Hannity was completely off base, which he wasn't.  The information will be placed in the article in a NPOV way it will not be placed there at all.  And the way that the Phelps information keeps getting removed is simply POV. 
 Phelps being or not being a Democrat has nothing at all to do with Sean Hannity.  
That is a incorrect conclusionary statement.  You did not provide an argument to back up your personal opinion.  So thank you for your personal opinion, but it is not controlling.

However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself.

Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism

By lsanger in Op-Ed

Wikipedia has started to hit the big time. Accordingly, several critical articles have come out, including """"The Faith-Based Encyclopedia"""" by a former editor-in-chief of Britannica and a very widely-syndicated AP article that was given such titles as """"When Information Access Is So Easy, Truth Can Be Elusive"""".

These articles are written by people who appear not to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully. I do, however; I co-founded Wikipedia. (I have since left the project.)

Wikipedia does have two big problems, and attention to them is long overdue. These problems could be eliminated by eliminating a single root problem. If the project's managers are not willing to solve it, I fear a fork (a new edition under new management, for the non-techies reading this) will probably be necessary.

TAB

Let me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.

First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.

My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.

You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?

I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.

Another benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.

Perhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.

Wikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college class",0

From Fraser:

This article possesses a number of quite significant errors:

First, concerning the so-called characteristics of the deep house sound, many deep house tracks have a 'thumpy' bass drum sound, thus making them practicable for a dancefloor; although there is a wide use of effects employed in the production of deep house music, the use of filters etc., is no more prevalent than in other sub-genres of house, for instance disco house (where filters are used ad nauseum) and dub house (where reverb and echo are pronounced). 

In contrast to the traits mentioned in the article that characterise the deep house sound, I would argue that the most defining characteristic of the music is its mood, being typically abstract and atmospheric, more concerned with taking the listener on a mental expedition that making a dancefloor move.

Lastly, the statement that """"deep house music is often synonymous with 'Lounge Music'"""" is quite simply untrue and should not be kept in this article. Deep house music, although often possessing loungey characteristics, for example, vibraphones, smooth rhodes keys etc., never has and never will be seen as equivalent to lounge music. I am really quite shocked that such misinformation was put on the site; the person who wrote the article, whilst possessing some knowledge of the music, is well wide of the mark in a number of his or her comments.

I am basing all my judgments on being a DJ and avid deep house record collector for 10 years.""",0

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166

 needs balanced perspective 

Climate change should be discussed with global warming entry – they are one and the same thing.

This has to be a balanced discussion also discussing the forecasts and uncertainties in forecasting temperature / CO2 increase which are proposed as the causes of the examples of climate change that are presented.

Discuss the politicization (sp?) of the entire issue, the role of IPCC, of Gore etc.  This is very much at the heart of the attention and emphasis being given.  

Discussion of post 1950s warming does not mention the pre 1950s temperature drop that is not explained by the forcings and “predictive” climate models. 

The forecasts / predictions are major part of the actual basis for the attention and emphasis in the carefully planned publicity campaign of the IPCC.  IPCC readily acknowledges that their role is to expand awareness to provide push for policy makers.  The 90 / 95 / etc. probabilities are without merit, are not based on independent scientific fact but Delphi polling of scientists who are doing the scientific modeling.  In fact, IPCC acknowledge that it is not possible to predict the future trajectory which is why they are developing scenarios not forecasts.  Scenarios assume a set of initial values or base starting points for the forcings and forecast how these forcings will play out over time.  This does not adequately take into account technological change that is and will continue to occur.  None of this is identified and discussed in this entry.

In this regard, some analogies with Thomas Malthus """"An Essay on the Principle of Population"""" (1798), [aka """"Malthusian catastrophe, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit (Wikipedia)], Paul Ehrlich """"The Population Bomb"""" (1968), Club of Rome """"Limits to Growth"""" (1972), as well as Orsen Well radio case of H.G. Wells """"War of the Worlds"""" (1936) as an example of how the media can be an  effective force in public opinion.

Both in the US and UK court rulings do not allow presenting / discussing the climate change issues without a balanced view of the issues such as mentioned here.  Wikipedia entries should also be required to be required to meet the same standards in presenting balanced views. 

The need for climate change policy is  based on economic evaluation of the future pattern of costs vs. benefit.  The Stern review – which is discussed – has been strongly criticized in peer reviewed journals because of its assumptions and approaches which very greatly favor support the recommendations, which is neither scientific or intellectually honest.  See e.g., the following references.

Nordhaus, WILLIAM  Q., “A Review of the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change,” Journal of Economic Literature Vol. XLV (September 2007), pp. 686–702

economic-environmental models: Purchasing power parity or market exchange rates?,”  Science Direct: Energy Economics 29 (2007) 349–372  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

You seem to have missed the line at the very beginning: 'for current global climate change see global warming'. Merging them would be like merging the history of the United States with the 2008 presidential election...  

The global warming page in the terminology section states that global warming is an example of climate change, a subset as it were. The way these two articles are broken up is completely wrong. 122.104.2.224  

How so? Global climate change is purely the projected change of the climate. Global warming is an example of climate change - it is the heating of the climate. However, if temperatures drop, which many people believed before, that too would be global climate change. 
I do, however, agree that this page needs to be expanded.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • [[Special:Co",0

According to many sources, such as Bartold, they were mainly of Turkic origin.

Monmouth County may be the one county with the most number of small incorporated municipalities, and it makes it difficult to show all the legal borders.

 Map data? 

Hi Jim, I saw your recent uploads of Image:Andover boro nj.jpg and Image:Andover twp nj.jpg and I was wondering where the map data came from, and what tools you used to put it together.  I'd like to make similar maps for other areas.  Thanks.  (t) 
The software was Manifold, the data was from multiple sources.  The administrative boundaries and water features were from the Census Bureau's 2004 Tiger/Line (second edition) files for Sussex County, the road network was from the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and the place names and locations were from the USGS Geographic Name Information Service files.  I used information from the Tiger/Line files to identify the divided highways.  The New Jersey state outline was from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2004 National Transporation Atlas Databases state boundary file.  
Interesting, but I think Manifold may be out of my price range.  Thanks for your contribtions, these are quite complex maps compiled from several public domain sources, good work.  BTW, is it possible to upload PNG or SVG output from Manifest?  The current JPEGs have compression artifacts, as JPEG was intended for photos, not solid-color-region graphical data.  See Wikipedia:Preparing images for upload.  Thanks.   (t) 

Thanks, I changed all the maps to PNG files.   

 Thanks for the maps! 
Hi Jim, I also appreciated your maps for Sussex County and the ones that seem to be appearing as I type for Passaic County. I have been part of a small group working on Wikiproject New Jersey, a project aimed at filling in the holes and expanding the details regarding New Jersey in all its aspects. While there are portions of the state covered by your maps, and those ChrisRuvolo has created, we could definitely use maps for all of the 566 municipalities in the state (plus the CDPs and unincorporated areas if possible). Any assistance that you could provide in creating and uploading maps, or in providing guidance in their creation, would be most appreciated. We could divvy up the map creation work so that we can ensure that the whole state is covered, and not just by one or two people.  

I think the maps are great, and I see that Warren County is underway. My only question is that on some of the maps, particularly for smaller municipalities (e.g., Belvidere, New Jersey), it can be hard to distinguish between the highlighted municipality and the rest of the county. Is there any way to change the colors to improve the contrast? Other than that, keep up the great work!  

Some of the smallest places do get lost.  The larger red label was an attempt to highlight the principle location on each map, but at the scale of the map, there isn't much to be done for the small places.  I started out mostly interested in showing the township outlines, since most of the online street map servers don't show township outlines.  Once I have a county set up, it is relatively easy to produce an entire set of maps all at the same scale, but it would be much more work to change the scale or colors for individual towns.  Maybe there will be time to revisit the smaller places later on.

But, the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations. For instance, you've assumed I wanted Roux gone, when there's never been any such expressed desire from me, either im- or explicitly, neither before nor now. It also seems that you've excused Roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for (not to say I feel I should be excused from anything I've done).
If I may express my opinion, Roux is a good editor, but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique; yes, I bare my own biases, but I come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences, and recent events seem to show that it isn't changing. It is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim, and, seemingly sensing some threat, responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. While that can cause some problem in itself, the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who don't buy his claims of innocence and casualty, after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. If it wasn't already obvious: I am one of those stubborn persons, believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. Thus, I honestly don't for one minute buy that Roux was """"driven"""" to do anything; he chose to participate here in the manners that he did, both good and bad, and he chose to leave; just as I chose to participate in the manners that I did, chose to leave, chose to come back, chose to leave again, chose to come back, and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things.

Dear Wikipedia """"""""Neutrality"""""""" guardian, 
Re Saddam Hussein entry,
no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the 
primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not? 

You could have Written """"Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west"""". Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered 
Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  """"human-rights situation"""" which you hope anyone can interpret as anything. 
Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?

revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only """"a situation"""". A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.

Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen!
Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?
 
I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to 
disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must
be some divine logic here beyond my rationality.
Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then?
Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY
that means not ONLY the palestinians!
 
Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds?
if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes 
important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as
""""Human rights situation""""? 

and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the
henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps?
remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men.
they might cause something to your """"Human rights situation"""" otherwise. 

And this pargraph:

an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction

do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!

And this,

""""Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.""""

Are you hinting that this sentence:
""""While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians""""

is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther
any references of this, or just hearsay?

Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it!
(never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?)
And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.
Mentioning FACTS is never skewering, even if the palestinians don't like them!

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

"Jung And Einstein 

In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. 

Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. 

The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.",0

With all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton's character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about """"politically correct noncompetitive recreation""""), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of """"corruption"""" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.

I am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia's guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article's immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's """"unofficial source,"""" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I'm no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?

Equally embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short """"Articles suggest..."""" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (""""There have been a number of criticisms..."""") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.

If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is """"efficient."""" And move on. 173.52.83.2  M32""",0

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals.

Therefore you can not call TaNaKh a canon just so it can fall into the same definition as Christian works. This is particularly true since the TaNaKh is not consistently used by Christianity to 'rule' on issues of dogma, and the Christian canon is not used at all in Jewish halacha.""",0

"""Stop cutting my information just because you don't like it==
I found an Associated Press report from after World War I that states that Bethmann-Hollweg was partly of Jewish extraction.  I added this to the personal information about Bethmann-Hollweg, along with a link to a PDF of the article in the New York Times.  All I said was that according to this article, he was of Jewish extraction. That is a demonstrably, undeniably true statement!  It definitely was stated in an AP report that appeared in the New York Times that Bethmann-Hollweg was of Jewish descent.  Why then would somebody keep removing this reference?  GoodMorningWorld has done this several times. He claims that it is CERTAINLY not true, but IT IS CERTAIN that the AP said it and that it appears in the New York Times.  If GoodMorningWorld has some argument that the claim in the AP story was wrong then he should post it in the text of the article along with the claim.  Otherwise he appears to be trying to censor information that he finds disagreeable. Who the hell does he think he is?  
I explained to you why including this information in the article is inappropriate, on your Talk page on July 2: """"It doesn't matter what some foreign correspondent for the NYT mistakenly wrote 90 years ago if we know with certainty that it is false. The only reason to include it in the encyclopedia would be if the false report had turned into an incident in its own right. In that case, some brief mention might be warranted. Otherwise, no."""" Wikipedia is not an indiscrimate collection of information.   

You haven't explained anything that matters.  You assert that the information is false, despite the eminence of the source, and the information is to be suppressed based on nothing more than your say-so.  Why you believe that it is false is your own secret; it is clear only that you do not want to allow it to be discussed. I do not think that this kind of dogmatism and censoriousness represent an appropriate attitude for someone contributing to an encyclopaedia. 

Since there is a section of the article that discusses Bethmann-Hollweg's ethnic heritage, I think it is clearly relevant that he was identified by the Associated Press and the New York Times in his own lifetime as a person of Jewish descent. The Associated Press and the New York Times are normally considered credible journalistic sources, so that the burden of proof rests on you to show that what was reported was false. If you really know what you pretend to know, that Bethmann-Hollweg was not a person of Jewish descent, then prove it.   
I'm growing really tired of Hadding's belligerent, know-nothing approach to encyclopedic articles. Wikipedia isn't some game where you fire up Google, find a hit, then carry that snippet back here and wedge it into an article, without knowing anything at all about the article subject and therefore being in no position to evaluate its accuracy. I am reverting Hadding's repeated insertion of false information. Hadding, consider this your only warning. If you continue this destructive and harmful approach I will report you to an admin noticeboard. Alternatively – if you want to demonstrate a sincere interest – then learn German and read this passage in a book by historian Fritz Fischer, which speaks of B.-H.'s parentage. Or just read the goddamn Wikipedia article which already contains that information.   

That is not a """"passage"""" about """"Bethmann-Hollweg's parentage.""""  That is a chapter about Bethmann-Hollweg as chancellor, from a book about Hitler. I do not believe that the claim from the Associated Press and New York Times about Bethmann-Hollweg's Jewish ethnic heritage is addressed whatsoever in that book.  

If there is a sentence in that book that you think makes your case then why don't you cite it?  

I hope that you do call in the administrators, because I would like to call attention to a certain paranoid mind that believes that there is some conspiracy spanning the entire internet with the purpose of misrepresenting certain people as Jews. To wit, from the history page of the Bethmann-Hollweg entry:

 Ahir-Yadava Connection 
Hi to all
It is sad to see so much of talk page wasted on a single point. People don't understand the problem and people have also failed to communicate the problem to users who are just schoolboys. Many of them are simply not aware that prior to being named yadav they were registered as Ahir in british census. so, instead of bringing yadava rulers of the past they need to show Ahir Yadava connection. Here is MSA Rao's statement on the subject-""""Historical & Semihistorical Evidences are available for equating Ahir with Yadava."""" . Boys you will do a great job if you just google, all the stuffs I had added in Ahir as Yadava section. 

One important observation in this regard is All historical yadavas found till date has been traced to abhira ancestry. historical Yadavas story bigins with Trikuta(800AD), who were Abhira. There is a very long gap between Yadavas of mythical era and those historians have traced so this would always be a matter of debate, and this has nothing to do with the arrival date of Abhira, because most of Hindu scriptures including Mahabharata has been written between 6th and 8th century AD, and are suspected to be backward projection. 

One important fact regarding Yadavas is that, though it means descent from Yadu, actually it means claiming Krishna lineage. Cult of krishna has no eveidence of existence before the beginning of the Christian era. so, dynasties had actually two kinds of claim, one from Krishna the God of Abhira, and another from Krishna the hero of Mahabharata. Again those who have adopted Krishna of Mahabharata did so only after it was written. These people are suspected to have styled on that line. There are Scholars(Check Rusell,B.V.) who believe Krishna of mahabharata is actually a cunning cruft of Brahmanas,and episodes related to him in Mahabharata are actually later days interpolations, done after stealing the god and philosophy of abhira tribe.

At Talk:Americans you told me to walk away from the discussion. I offered to walk away and stop editing that article if you would also agree to discontinue editing that article. What's your answer?  (t•c)  
Walk away, as in walk away from the argument. Why would I walk away from an article? That is just silly. See WP:SOAPBOX. Please, stop it.
The consensus that was created allowed both POVs in the lead paragraph, allowing for the statement about non-citizens claiming American identity, which is sourced by a source provided by .
I really don't see what the argument here is. Both POV's are provided due weight. Both views are presented. The content was improved by adding percentages of non-citizens counted by the census.
Therefore, please walk away.  
The introduction consensus is Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" 

It places Sparkie82 point of view front and center. What is the rationale for removing """"non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates"""" which other editors sought to include as they are counted by the U.S. census as sourced and included in discussions throughout the literature? To change, there must be a rationale, a counter-source, and context among the preponderance of sources which include more than citizens so as to gain a new consensus on the Talk page.   

@TheVirginiaHistorian I'm fine with what you just said was the consensus, i.e., """"Citizens of the United States are referred to as Americans. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens and expatriates may also claim an American identity."""" That is a compromise version we reached a while ago. However, RightCowLeftCoast keeps changing the first sentence to: """"Americans, or American people, are citizens of the United States of America."""" and then he declares that his version (which he has been defending for years!) is a consensus, which it is not. At this point, I sincerely question his able to act in good faith.  (t•c)  

@RightCowLeftCoast, if you sincerely want to see the article be the best that it can be and you trust the community to tend to the article, and you don't simply want to keep inserting your own version into it, then please stop editing the article. If you do, I will also stop editing it. What is your answer?  (t•c)  
The edit made changed the lead paragraph which was stable for several months, claiming to change it to a consensus version, while not. It failed to provide references for the lead sentence, which the stable version has in spades. Futhermore, the sentence in the stable version remains in the lead paragraph after the second sentence which explaining the multicultural nature of Americans. This sets up for the third sentence. All the content is well cited and, the cite added in the reverted edit by Sparkie82 is a duplicate source from the current third sentence.
The fact that Americans are Citizens of the United States is very well cited in the stable version.
As this is about article content this is better of in the Americans talk page and not my talk page, and kindly ask Sparkie82 to leave me alone.  """,0

UNPRODUCTIVE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS or why the word """"PRACTISED"""" is not the case of Lubitz's earlier actions.

For example, people trying to commit suicide with a gun often put the weapon to their head and then they interrupt this action moments before they pull the trigger. Viewed from the side, those unsuccessful suicide attempts are like theatrical act but this is just an illusion because every such attempt has the potential to end tragically. In the case of Lubitz - in the situation in which he intended to carry out his suicide there are several circumstances that limit his freedom of choice to interrupt the suicidal attempt - such as """"returning of the Captain"""" or """"what you are doing in the cabin?!"""". These circumstances can force his unproductive suicide attempts to became productive one in any moment and he knows that after them he will have no choice to turn back. For this reason it is """"normal"""" he to do first timid attempts - which were unsuccessful in the first flight """"Duesseldorf to Barcelona"""" because time is not limited. On his return back """"Barcelona to Duesseldorf"""" the end destination is forcing him.

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

Time to start final editing
This article now has a wealth of information, more than enough to cover the subject. I suggest we begin to go through a section at a time and tighten up.
Is all sourced with recognized reliable sources? A scholarly article in a peer reviewed article may be a more appropriate source than a book review in a church magazine. (For instance, maybe the Lutheran Church parish magazine is not the best place to find scholarly information on Martin Luther? I'm Lutheran, so I can poke at myself for fun.)
Is the grammar OK?
How is POV?
Is it covered in other articles and can be removed or moved to the appropriate article?
Evaluate the number and usefulness of some of the citations.
I share some (not all) of Blue Tie's frustrations about the article. Perhaps some fresh editors can read through it for continuity and point out where the article is unclear and where it is too detailed or muddled.
Are our sources balanced? Have we used too many or too few apologetic works?
Have we strayed into Original Research by using so much from the Journal of Discourses? Do any of the established reliable sources cover this same material? Can we quote from them instead? I don't know, but think it should be discussed.

Blue Tie's comments about the background section intro have made me evaluate some of what I wrote. I still need to tighten up and give attributions. I might say """"Historians Brooks and Quinn, as well as others, attribute the Mountain Meadows massacre to a number of factors relating to the conditions in the Utah Territory in 1857."""" Both are mentioned in the ref sections for curious readers to check out. The succeeding subsections should point to the exact citations in those sources.

We need to be evaluating and clarifying, not expanding. (Yes, this is my opinion and it is never humble.) The article is not coming together, it is becoming unwieldy. I came in to help with citations, so I have little ownership for the earlier content. Perhaps my edits have only added to the confusion. I am trying to remain neutral, but it is easy to get sucked in. Are there tools to use for editing? I have been using a sandbox to do major re-writes, then moving it over. Do we want to take a section at a time somewhere else and cuss and discuss it? I have never worked to create a featured article, so I look for guidance in the best way to proceed.

There are basically three of us now editing, and it may be time to step back and let others with a fresh eye work for a while. I know I have miles of articles to go before I sleep. So, I am looking for direction. (and going to work.)  """,0

"I agree with you 
Wikipedia does need to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web 2.0 encyclopedia. Here was something I said in the talk page of the 'a more perfect union'.

(I believe that most of time the argument is about this main issue of 'Is Wikipedia is being used for publicity?' and NOT an argument about whether it is just an 'Encyclopedia of important events or topics occuring or occured'. I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons. Most of the times people are forgotten but what they have done or said makes them remembered. Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech. I say let the people decide how they filter their information, because the election only objectively affects 300 million Americans [9], but the race-issue affects everybody on the planet, and this speech IS a key speech on that matter.Msethisuwan (talk) )",0

 List of New Jersey Devils players 

I have created a List of New Jersey Devils players to compliment the one in categories. When making player additions to the New Jersey Devils article, could you also add the player to the list of Devils players? Thanks! Masterhatch 5 August 2005
Is this a complete list that will be updated periodically? Do we have a master database for this information anywhere?  (T | C) 

Devils Captain soon?
Say RGTraynor and/or Masterhatch, do you know if the Devils plan to name Patrik Elias captain, when he returns to the lineup? Or is the captaincy to remain vacant for the 2005-06 season?

 No knowledge, although possibly the Devils' website has an archived press release to that effect.  In any event it's speculative, and there's no need to post anything until and unless the Devils make any formal announcement of a new captain.   

 I've added Scott Niedermayer to the Devils """"Captain list"""", as he's on the captains list, in the Offical New Jersey Devils website.  
Because we really need more reminders of how we got shafted this season?? ;)  (T | C) 

Wow, the is team most of the most amount of American players in the NHL!  

Scouts and Rockies
Why are you expanding content knowing that such content has articles to themselves???  
Because I plan on expanding the Scouts & Rockies articles beyond what they say, and the history of the organizations should be mentioned in the article on the current version of the franchise.  I'm thinking ahead to when this is further expanded, since I plan on improving this article to Featured article status. Besides, they're still only paragraphs compared to the main article as a whole.   Hit me up... 

Maybe others disagree, but I think this article should only explain the circumstances of the Rockies relocation to NJ. Its also borderline plagiarism of the source you cited. It is obvious you took thier copy and merely editted it to your liking.  

 Current practice on the NHL Team Pages is to write up the history of previous incarnations of the same franchises on their particular pages, and have a very brief summary at best on the current page.  Expanding the KC/Colorado pages makes perfect sense; duplicating the same text on the NJ page is redundant and liable to be reverted.   

Relevant to this discussion:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/History of the New Jersey Devils

Steve Gionta
dont remove that.  
Why?  It is fairly unimportant information.  It is quite common for relatives to be in the same sport.  See Notable families in the NHL for a number of examples of relatives that have actually made it to the NHL.  I will remove the information.    
Agreed.  Until Steve does something notable, he doesn't belong in the article.  

Team Logo
Can we come to a consensus on whether or not the logo should be used in the season-by-season record table? I don't know if it is legitimate fair use as I'm not a lawyer. I would rather see the logos removed from that table because they are pointless and repetitive. In an article called """"New Jersey Devils"""", can't we assume that someone looking at that table would know its referring to the New Jersey Devils? Is the fact that the logo once had green in it somehow relevant to their record on the ice?  (talk) 
I can't comment on the fair use aspect, but I do agree that adding logos to each year in the records table is rather pointless.  [[User:Cholmes75|cholmes75]",0

 Merging Dark matter in fiction 

The concept is not something that requires an entire article. It should be placed here and kept down to two or three paragraphs. The lists are pointless and do not need to be kept, though a few important examples can be taken to be used in the paragraphs.   
 Oppose per recent AfD.   
How does using a """"no consensus"""" AfD to oppose something make any sense? If you believe that the information cannot fit here, please just state that instead.   
There was no consensus for deletion, which is what the merge would effectively be - or are you suggesting that anything actually be added to the article beyond the paragraph that is already there?   \
I'm thinking the beggining paragraphs and a decent number of examples for now. Either way, the current article would have to end up in that shape anyway.   
 If it's going to be here, will this article's editors actually permit it? I get the feeling that article was created as a spinout of this one.   
Generally, they are only created because people keep piling on every single trivial reference to the topic they can find. They aren't usually split if they are actually kept down to a decent size.   
Right, but there's a tangibly greater resistance to WP:IPC sections in hard science topics than there are in general arts/literature articles.  I've already gone through and pared the list down during the AfD, and flagged about half of the rest as unreferenced.  If only the referenced sections were kept, that would still be substantially larger than the target size you advocate. In my mind, another AfD in a month or two would be a more straightforward way to handle it: either the list meets notability guidelines or it doesn't, but calling it a """"merge"""" and deleting 90+% of the content is not the right way to get rid of the article.   
The problem with going back to AfD is that the system is completely hit or miss. If you get the right people, it is certainly possible to get this deleted on the second go, but at the same time, it is also possible that this could get to the fifth nomination without anything more the five """"no consensus"""" results. Merging in the few decent references and a few of the examples is much better, as it allows for more control.   
Eh, I guess I'd rather see the entries that currently fail WP:V sourced or removed and the list kept as a separate article, so I guess that means I Oppose this merger as stated.   
The separate lists will have to be removed eventually, so there is really no benefit in keeping it. Even if you were to add references to every one of the current pieces of trivia, they would still be take up undue weight, and it would have to shift into paragraph format eventually. The proper way is to cite one or two for each different kind of media, and in a properly sourced article, they could probably be used to identify things like the first real use of Dark Matter in fiction and the like.   
 That eventuality isn't obvious to me from my reading of WP:SAL and WP:IPC.   
We do not have any featured lists that follow this kind of format (unless you can point any out), so that is one definite sign that these are doomed to either sit forever, be deleted, or actually be used to fill in the parent topic. Despite the fact that these are never sourced, it would actually be quite easy to do so if someone felt like it, and such a list would probably still be flat-out rejected for being trivial.   
Oppose merge.  Good list that could be improved.  Best, My talk 
Oppose. Almost all the examples in the 'Dark matter in fiction' article are very different to dark matter in astronomy. They are better as separate articles. Putting the fiction stuff here would distract attention away from the science and discourage ex",0

"Cobden, Ontario

Hello, I'm a moderate user of wikipedia. My Opus for this site has to be the article I wrote on Cobden, Ontario. This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article.

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time.

 Tram and trolleybus articles 

Thanks for your comments.  I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport, particularly in continental Europe, since the early 1980s, and that, of course, is the subject matter of the newly translated template (and the articles that are and will be linked to it).

Until recently, en.wiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have.  Although I can't speak Italian, and can barely read it, translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator.  Since November last year, I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations.  Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in en.wiki, the it.wiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step.

Since I started work on my latest project, I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in de.wiki, so I will start translating some of the de.wiki articles soon.  In the meantime, I have just created one very long overdue en.wiki article, Trams in Milan (not fully translated as yet), and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days.

Which brings me to a query about nomenclature.  There's quite a bit of material on both it.wiki and de.wiki about individual classes of trams (and trolleybuses).  However, I'm not sure how translations of those articles should be named.  If an article is about a generic make and model (eg Siemens Desiro), then it can just be named as """"make model"""".  But if a tram class is unique to a particular network, the issue of naming is less clear.  There are several en.wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form: W-class Melbourne tram.  However, that form doesn't seem right to me.  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram, which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives (eg British Rail Class 47).  What do you think?   """,0

Can I ask three impertinent questions of you.  Firstly, I am assuming you are the real Greg Kane, in which case, have you found Linda yet ? An old joke, I know, but anything to break the ice. Frippery aside, could I point out COI for your information and enlightenment - it is part of Wikipedia's guidelines and protocols, that you need to be aware of.  Secondly, if you are not the actual 'Mr Kane', then your user name may be fall foul of Wikipedia:Username policy - see the sections under the headings 'appropriate usernames' and 'real names'. Actually, I really am Derek R Bullamore for what it's worth. Thirdly, having now put you completely on your guard, I am assuming that you may have access to some decent sources (press clippings, promo items, concert fliers, whatever) that might help greatly improve the present articles on Hue and Cry, Greg Kane and Pat Kane. If so, are you generally willing to share some of that information here ?

I appreciate this is a bit of a heavy, full barrelled, opener from me. Do you now just crave some """"Sweet Invisibility"""" ?  Best wishes,

Sorry to eavesdrop, but are you sure third-party sites are reliable sources for WWE results? That notion sounds a bit absurd knowing that these third-parties get their information from a fourth-party, and they have no way to confirm what they're reporting to be true. I have read a lot of errors on some third-party results; they could be as minimal as mixing up the moves used in a match, but the reality is that mixing up at least something usually happens in all these results pages.

Well, two counter-points and an attempt to help you see the main point again.  First, you authoritatively state yellowcake would """"barely qualify"""" as a dirty bomb but it is not clear what standard you are using since the AP article states the following.  """"Exposure carries well-documented health concerns associated with heavy metals such as damage to internal organs, experts say. """"The big problem comes with any inhalation of any of the yellowcake dust,"""" said Doug Brugge, a professor of public health issues at the Tufts University School of Medicine"""".  Second, the AP article notes there is """"remaining radioactive debris"""" at Tuwaitha.  I'm not sure if you've been on the ground (I leave that possibility open) but unless you have a source to back up your point, the AP article reads like there is other material there that are radiological.  But if we are actually reasoning together you will see that is not my main point about why we should post the AP article.  The AP source reaffirms that Iraq did have WMD material; known or unknown it not the point.  You claim yellowcake is not WMD material but the Canadians bought it to make nuclear energy so your definition of WMD material seems personal.  The reader of this entry on WMD should know that Iraq had this material and if not, this section of the site is imbalanced.  That is my point.""",0

@ TFD. An academic forum of scholars rewrote their papers for academic publication co-author-edited by Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew Sparrow. Sparrow, the political scientist lead, noted historical context can inform the earlier mistaken view in the field of political science, that the federal republic was solely the states without territories. """"The U.S. has always been more than states."""" Correcting errors of narrow-scope in the fields was the point of constitutional historians and political scientists talking to one another, and the book.

Territories can be a part of a federal republic. They are incorporated prior to statehood by congressional “legacy of the Northwest Territory”. The modern U.S. territories all enjoy more privileges than the last four territories admitted to the Union. You admit Arizona, New Mexico, Alaska and Hawaii were all incorporated into the U.S. federal republic before statehood, but you still misunderstand Sparrow’s direct quote, cited and linked, copied and pasted.    10:15""",0

"Redlinks 

Allow me to outline a scenario. On an article about a TV program there is a redlink to an actor who appeared in a one-line role, and were know as Taxi Driver #2. The article is created, but as they have only ever appeared in one episode of a TV program where there part consisted of six words, the article is tagged with a CSD A7, another user removes the tag, the article is PROD-ed, on day 6.5 the PROD is removed the article goes to AfD, then five days later id deleted, because the actor fails the GNG and WP:ACTOR, the link turns red again. I would argue that Marshall's brothers and Carl the bartender may have appeared in enough episodes of HIMYM to get articles, but if HIMYM is all they have done then they fail the GNG. Given that day players are unlikely to ever bass the bar for GNG there is little point in redlinking every extra on HIMYM.

The 2008 ratification of The Great Lakes Commission finally commits American and Canadian governments to the geographical definition of the North American Great Lakes as a distinctive political entity.  In fact and operation, the complex cooperative management of The Great Lakes for purposes of trade, border discipline, parks, transportation, hydro-power, water management and environmental protection has been a reality since 1815.   Ethnically and economically, the borders have always been porous.   Politically, the region has more bi-national commonalities than generally supposed.    Much of Ontarian political culture derived from both Anglo-American heritage and the simultaneous influence and threat of American examples.   More importantly, both the American and Canadian sides played analogous roles in the world-economy.   Both sides of the border transformed from peripheries that supplied natural resources; to semi-peripheries that performed middle-man brokerage functions; to core regions, represented by such world cities as Chicago and Toronto, that provided hubs of capital, administration, and management.   History, politics, culture, and ethnic composition, as well as the more obvious economy, technology, and geology, define Ontario and American Great Lakes states as one region.  04:11, 27 January 2009",0

My understanding of the cringe is that it is essentially a sense of inferiority or embarrassment at all things Scottish felt by some Scots themselves.

"""::The less offensive term of equal clarity and brevity is """"British & Irish Isles"""". Believe when I say that the Manx natives have no trouble with this description as they are linked to the U.K. as a protected and supported territory, Republic of Ireland on the other hand is a sovereign nation with no link to the U.K.

The basis for usage of the term is completely flawed logic as it refers to ancient texts etc and precedent for calling them the British isles. Place names reflect current realities, thus we have Istanbul and not Constantinople.

A better example would be the Aegean coast of Turkey and its islands. this whole area was once referred to as the Greek coast and all the islands were Greek islands. since the political landscape has changed and the Turkish state has jurisdiction, the only islands which are now """"Greek islands"""" are those within the jurisdiction of Greece. if you were to rebut by saying that British refers to something more than a political term, but rather than an ethnic or geographical one, then the same argument (or even a better one can be made of Greek). the Greek world once referred to an area far greater than modern or ancient Greece (e.g. southern Italy, Sicily, turkey, Armenia etc) and many of the people residing in those parts of turkey which were formerly designated """"Greek"""" are ethnically and linguistically Greek but live in the state of turkey, and therefore the islands and coast are Turkish.

Thus, you could not refer to the island of Ireland as British.

Then during the 1970s people began using that term to refer to what they refered to as 'political Islam.' Then Daniel Pipes popularized the usage of the term.

 """"British Isles"""" 

Hi. Thanks for your note; I assure you that the detailed explanations you offered weren't necessary — for somebody who doesn't live in Ireland or in the UK, I think I have an excellent knowledge of the region.

Where I differ from you is in my understanding of the word """"British."""" To my ears, """"British Isles"""" is an ancient and 'unmarked' (to use some linguistics terminology) phrase; to my ears, the anamalous thing is the use of the adjective """"British"""" as though it were the proper adjective for the United Kingdom. It's not; when used as such it's imprecise shorthand. You call the phrase """"British Isles"""" Victorian; but of course it is much older than that; and the ancient origins of all this terminology vastly predates the modern political situation (even if we define """"modern"""" as meaning """"the past millennium"""").

The deeper question, of course, is whether you have a terminological objection or a geographical one— do you object merely to the phrase """"British Isles""""; or do you object to the whole notion that these particular islands can be considered together as a set? Because, see, I think it's pretty obvious at a geographical level (far before humans arrived to hurt each other's feelings) that the islands can reasonably be considered a group. But once we consider them as a group, we have to call them something. I don't think any alternative to """"British Isles"""" has much currency.

I understand that for some Irish people the phrase rankles; but if they think that the phrase, when used by people from the UK, is full either of arrogance or ignorance or triumphalist glee, I'm quite confident they're mistaken in thinking so. Certainly in the rest of the world, outside those two countries, """"British Isles"""" is a phrase used constantly and frequently by well-educated people who are fully aware of the two countries / two islands involved, and who have no emotional investment in their sometimes strained history.  |  talk """,0

This is not funny, guys. Look at their respective article's pictures. It looks like someone took the Pratchett pic, rotated it, and changed the subject's outfit. Personally, I'm surprised that Dan Brown (the name that I'm currently using for Randi/Pratchett until I figure out what his real name is) didn't bother to dye his hair. 

Adding to the suspiciousness is the fact that both of them have had heart complications. Very CONVENIENT heart complications, which allows """"Pratchett"""" and """"Randi"""" to make public appearances in two different locations.

"Hey guys! This article is grossly focused on government numbers for the amount of Christians in different nations!!
For example, I'm half-Norwegian and half-Cantonese and I've gotta say... there are between 5-10% Christians in China and it's definitely not around 90% in Norway just because there are that many members in the State church. Will the number of Christians in Norway really fall by about 80% if the State Church is disbanded? Most of them wouldn't even care! It doesn't work that way. The number of Christians in a country are personal adherants to Jesus not whatever the State has got on paper. This isn't Islam where you're automatically a muslim at birth when someone orates the passage of faith to your ears as an infant in the crib (thus btw. making you eligible for persecution if you convert away from Islam), this is a volountary faith!
As a Norwegian I can witness personally that the number of Christians is definitely below 50% and China will probably pass the magical 10% marker in a decade or two.",0

 ==How it is - Answer== 

How it is

 He was a Romanian citizen
Not only Romanian! He was born a Austrian-Hungarian citizen (1913). He was a Soviet citizen too, for a long time, it is not clear if he ever got back the Romanian citizenship.

 He was a member of the PCR (thus a Romanian Communist)
... and of many other communist parties! No need to stress so much the romanian party. The romanian party was illegal at the time and it was considered a terrorist group; membership to such a URSS-sponsored group does not make """"Roman"""" Romanian. He was never a Romanian Communist; maybe you mean """"a member of the Party of the Communists from Romania"""".

 He lived in Romania
... and also in Spain, USSR, Czechoslovakia and France. Do not put undue stress on Romania.

Most of all, Neulander was a Soviet agent and comissar, ennemy of Romania, agent of occupation, whose mission was to establish communist rule in occupied Romania. Now stop spreading the anti-Romanian propaganda.  """,0

 Controversial Cupboard 

I have very little time left now for major work here so I propose making a subsection of this, my talk page, since it's getting a teency weency bit long now. (171 kilobytes)

The first cupboard will be entitled """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" and I propose moving whole sections of my talk page into it - if there are no vehement and persuasive objections. I'll keep the same chronological order, but these are the sections I plan on moving in their entirety:- 
    * 7 Stop canvassing!

    * 9 Sockpuppetry block
    * 10 Unblocked
    * 17 Result of PIRA investigation

    * 41 Legal threat
    * 46 Block

    * 48 Block reduced

I estimate that this """"housekeeping""""/censorship will reduce this page's size by more than 65% and make it more manageable for those of readers who use dial up modems and/or are moaning.

I realise that some of these sections are not wholly concerned with """"Irish Terrorism/Politics"""" but all have comments that could be categorised as such and I did not wish to separate comment and riposte, in so far as that is practically possible....Gaimhreadhan (kiwiexile at DMOZ) talk  • """,0

Trolling by Bogdan and Constantzeanu
Bulgar necropoles have been discovered on the following sites: Topola, Durankulak (Dobrich region) and Istria, Obarshia Noua, Izvorul, Sultana in present-day Romania.

 Four Edits in 24 hours: True.  But it takes 2 to Tango. 

{{unblock|reason=You asked about the State Bar article, and that's fair.  In chronological order, on September 2 the article was """"protected."""" Why? The history shows that from August through November (4 months) the article was protected because the user SantiLak repeatedly vandalized the article.  The edit history, also shows that SantiLak reverted the article without any discussion whatsoever four times within 24 hours. He was warned previously by an Admin, but just took the warning off his Talk page and continued the pattern. Yesterday, the pattern continued.  I was merely attempting to keep the material from being deleted again without discussion.  If you find me in violation, I respect that. But at least, hold SantiLak to account as well because the history clearly shows he reverted 4 times in 24 hours, causing the article to go into protected status.  It’s up to you.  Whatever you decide, have a great day there’s nothing personal about this for me.  I just hope an article about a public entity does not get stripped to the point where it become little more than an advertising brochure bereft of noted criticism of that entity by the courts, mainstream news sources, and even former employees.  It’s a public entity, not a real person.  Some latitude seems appropriate, and some discussion before taking out huge chunks of information four times within 24 hours. 

Here is a clear showing of the article being protected after SantiLak vandalized it 4 times in less than 24 hours.

Chances are they are also a cult group, or even a ghost religion (one that exists only in the Internet).

If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags, we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month's time. It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias. Quotes should be either from notable newspapers, magazines and books (self-published books not included).

Umm, he shouldn't be categorized as anything specifically, as is how they've generally done it with all prominent people who didn't leave enough information on wikipedia.  And Madison is often considered to have been a straight-up atheist privately by historians - but that's kind of the point, that it's still very unknown, though he clearly rejected standard theism.  I'd be inclined to consider him a deist (which, btw, should not be capitalized) but it is not a religion, nor does it say anything about other beliefs that would encompass a religion.  98.168.192.162  

Actually, the word could just be changed to """"religious belief(s)"""" - rather than simply """"religion"""" as it stands - or something similar, and for that, I think """"deism"""" could be used since it's seemingly the most accepted stance he had (or am I wrong)? `98.168.192.162

Someone needs to rewrite the War of 1812 heading - """"British insults"""" """"hostile indians"""" """"american's didn't really want canada"""" - come on, lets see some neutral and TRUTHFUL info. Sure the British were impressing """"American"""" subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only """"restored"""" after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED. Regardless of what people say, this war did not prove Young America could hold their own against the old world, it showed they bit off more than they could chew in attempting to subjugate and forcibly liberate Canada against the populace's will. Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign. I may have rattled on a bit here butI think it just goes to show that that section needs rewriting to seem something other than some super-american-patriotic propaganda machine.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.136.246.144

See, that's always the way I'd considered it, too (although I'm a Catholic who supports Liverpool). However, the debate still rages fiercely - I used to work at Radio Merseyside on the Roger Phillips phone-in, and it would crop up all the time. As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club, you'd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club. It's such a fervent debate that there's really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry, and surely the fact that there's even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs aren't as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic - as such, I don't think it's necessary to include it.  14:47",0

 The article is incomplete 

Well written and interesting. Good.

I think the article would benefit from identifying the former bands of the members. What I find frustrating is that the article seems to assume knowledge of UK indie music. Why is it a supergroup? Who is Damon Albarn? Paul Simonon? Tony Allen? Simon Tong? I knew Damon, but I had to click 3 more links to find out the others. As an international wiki, anyone outside the UK will have no idea who these people are. The article should explain to anyone assuming no prior knowledge. Mention and link to the Clash, the Verve, Blur etc as well. 

After all, this is meant to be an encyclopaedia. It's not an article in NME, and space isn't an issue. Identifying the history of the members and explaining why it was considered a """"supergroup"""" is surely relevant to the article.

On another note - I only noticed who produced the album was here when I returned to it and looked at the top right side panel. I was expecting to find this at the bottom under the list of personnel. On my first visit I had to click other links to be certain that Danger Mouse had done it.

Language in Saskatchewan
Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the 1988 Mercure decision held that Article 110 of the  North West Territories Act determined that Saskatchewan was bilingual.  In a context in which jurisdiction over language rights not specified by the Charter is undetermined, this means a conflict between Bill 2 and the North West Territories Act exists.  From the CanLII website:  """"Article 110 embodies procedural rules that give rights to individuals and, in fact, those rules are to some extent framed in terms of rights.  They are language rights or language guarantees as all the cases in this Court from Jones to Société des Acadiens make clear.  Section 110 was not entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act was passed.  This, like the continuation of s. 110, is entirely in accord with the legislative history of these provisions.  Many of the questions raised about the reach of the protections like those accorded under s. 110 have already been determined in recent cases before this Court either under s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867, s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, or ss. 16-18 of the Charter.  All of these provisions are differently drafted but they use similar expressions and there has been a marked tendency to give them a similar interpretation.  Section 110 was obviously modelled on s. 133.  The language rights accorded by s. 110 are substantially the same as those accorded under these other provisions: R. v. Mercure, 1988 IIJCan 107 (C.S.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234; Paquette v. A.G. Canada and A.G. Alberta, 1990 CanLII 37 (S.C.C.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1103.""""

"In addition, you may want to read this as it is explained by author Mike Campbell:

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accuracy
during intervals of the flight.2

OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

The ethnic Macedonians only have one autonym - Macedonian. They don't want to piss off the Greeks. The use of the term to refer to themselves and their language is not an attack on Greeks. If it were, they would use the autonym """"Greek"""" not """"Macedonian"""". And """"Aegean Macedonia"""" is not necessarily an irredentist term. It can be used as such, but it is also used just to refer to Macedonia, Greece. You use the term """"Greek Macedonia"""" which is considered offensive by ethnic Macedonians because it suggests that that area is Hellenic, as opposed to only being under the control/jurisdiction of the Greek government. And then comes the dispute about whether Macedonia, Greece is Hellenic or not.

 Hungary during the Holocaust -The Kastner train 

             The 1955 Kasztner libel case: the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi.
The state of Israel claimed that Malkiel Grünwald's allegations against Kasztner were a lie. When Grünwald published these accusations, the Israeli Government did rather more than demand that his views should not be broadcast. Because a prominent Zionist official (Dr. Kastner was a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade and Industry) was involved, the Attorney General of the State of Israel prosecuted Grünwald for criminal libel. Let the verdict of Judge Benjamin Halevi (who later became one of the panel of three judges that tried Eichmann) in Israel's District Court of Jerusalem speak for itself.
The Attorney General v. Malkiel Grünwald
This material should be studied carefully. The masses of Jews from Hungary's ghettos obediently boarded the deportation trains without knowing their fate. They were full of confidence in the false information that they were being transferred to Kenyermeze. The Nazis could not have misled the masses of Jews so conclusively had they not spread their false information through Jewish channels. 
The Jews of the ghettos would not have trusted the Nazi or Hungarian rulers. But they had trust in their Jewish leaders. Eichmann and others used this known fact as part of their calculated plan to mislead the Jews. They were able to deport the Jews to their extermination by the help of Jewish leaders. The false information was spread by the Jewish leaders. The local leaders of the Jews of Kluj and Nodvarod knew that other leaders were spreading such false information and did not protest. Those of the Jews who tried to warn their friends of the truth were persecuted by the Jewish leaders in charge of the local 'rescue work'. The trust of the Jews in the misleading information and their lack of knowledge that their wives, children and themselves were about to be deported to the gas chambers of Auschwitz led the victims to remain quiescent in their ghettos. It seduced them into not resisting or hampering the deportation orders. Dozens of thousands of Jews were guarded in their ghettos by a few dozen police. Yet even vigorous young Jews made no attempt to overpower these few guards and escape to nearby Rumania. No resistance activities to the deportations were organized in these ghettos. And the Jewish leaders did everything in their power to soothe the Jews in the ghettos and to prevent such resistance activities. The same Jews who spread in Kluj and Nodvarod the false rumor of Kenyermeze, or confirmed it, the same public leaders who did not warn their own people against the misleading statements, the same Jewish leaders who did not organize any resistance or any sabotage of deportations . . . these same leaders did not join the people of their community in their ride to Auschwitz, but were all included in the Rescue train. The Nazi organizers of extermination and the perpetrators of extermination permitted Rudolf Kastner and the members of the Jewish Council in Budapest to save themselves, their relatives, and friends. The Nazis did this as a means of making the local Jewish leaders, whom they favoured, dependent on the Nazi regime, dependent on its good will during the time of its fatal deportation schedule. In short, the Nazis succeeded in bringing the Jewish leaders into collaboration with the Nazis at the time of the catastrophe.

The Nazi chiefs knew that the Zionists were a most vital element in Jewry and the most trusted by the Jews. The Nazis drew a lesson from the Warsaw ghetto and other belligerent ghettos. They learned that Jews were able to sell their lives very expensively if honorably guided. Eichmann did not want a second Warsaw. For this reason, the Nazis exerted themselves to mislead and bribe the Jewish leaders. The personality of Rudolph Kastner made him a convenient catspaw for Eichmann and his clique, to draw into collaboration and make their task easier.

The question here is not, as stated by the Attorney General in his summation, whether members of the Jewish Rescue Committee were or were not capable of fulfilling their duty without the patronage of the S.S. chiefs. It is obvious that without such S.S. Nazi patronage the Jewish Rescue Committee could not have existed, and could have acted only as an underground. The question is, as put by the lawyer for the defense, why were the Nazis interested in the existence of the Rescue Committee? Why did the S.S. chiefs make every effort to encourage the existence of the Jewish Rescue Committee? Did the exterminators turn into rescuers?

The same question rises concerning the rescue of prominent Jews by these German killers of Jews. Was the rescue of such Jews a part of the extermination plan of the killers ? The support given by the extermination leaders to Kastner's Rescue Committee proves that indeed there",0

With due respect this dog's breakfast of an article deserves a POV rampage and a much more exhaustive one than the minor changes made on December 11. Please look over some of the undocumented, irrelevant, and in some cases just plain weird interpretations of Revelation that were removed or edited and suggest which edits should be undone. The article as a whole is unnecessarily repetitive and only a small fraction of it represents the views of modern scholarship (see my comments above under Talk section 11: Everyone's view).

On Thomas Jefferson: Myth America I sympathise with your concern to '[provide] a useful contrast to the other interpretations in the article' which generally reflect conservative christian in-fighting about the meaning of the book but tell us very little about Revelation itself. I'm not convinced, however, that to dismiss the work as the incoherent ravings of an early christian """"heretic"""" (Cerinthus) is the best way to do this. A number of scholars have demonstrated that the book follows a clearly marked concentric structure which evidences balanced literary construction, while it has long been acknowledged that Revelation parodies and inverts the imagery of first century roman imperialism and the emperor cult in particular to make it's point (see eg Steven J Friesen's recent work in this area: Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John). This hardly supports Jefferson's view that the work is a meaningless rant but nor does it support the highly subjective perspectives of historicism and futurism which have obviously irritated you. A balanced, well documented historical-critical introduction to the work should, in my opinion, make up the bulk of this article with other conservative christian approaches acknowledged separately in brief, concise fashion. I am quite happy for the Jefferson reference to remain for its whimsical value and tentatively suggest that it could be accompanied by some of the numerous historical warnings by prominent christian leaders and commentators about the danger of misusing the book.

I also note that the reference to Mithraic parallels has been re-inserted in the Authorship section. What this has to do with the question of authorship I have no idea. The parallel itself is completely unconvincing and the book from which it is taken is a typical example of an author falling in love with his subject and unnecessarily exaggerating its importance. While I don't deny that the work, by Payam Nabarz, represents a good layman's guide to Mithraism the suggested parallel between this quote and Revelation 1:4-20 on page 51 (see Google books for the text) hardly warrants the preface that the two are 'almost identical' or the overly enthusiastic observation that 'the [similarity of] spirit is abundant... to the extent that the names of Jesus and Mithras could be interchangeable'. These are not the remarks of a careful exegete. It is quite likely that there are echoes of Mithraism, the religion of the roman army, in Revelation, which freely reuses both Jewish and greco-roman mythology in polemical fashion, but this is not one of them. Would anyone object to a re-removal of this paragraph?

Ottoman, why was the picture removed? It is found in the archives. 

Do not blame me! -) I could not figure that out (why someone do not like the wording """"local defense line"""" especially most of them in daily cloths) plus the logic of other things (considerations other than the history, I guess) that is happening on this page. If this would be my history, I would not be reckless on my heroes. Whaetever.  

I removed it because I thought that it came from the Battle of Van and not the Van Resistance.   

Ottoman, could you please type the entire passage from Robert-Jan Dwork Holocaust: A History by Deborah and van Pelt, p. 38, that talks about the 1st Armenian Republic? This doesn't sound right, but I want to see where it's coming from. 
Nowhere on that page it talks about the first Armenian republic. It does indeed talk about the Armenians. It first talk about Max Scheubner, it also quote from him. Then talk about the ten commandments of the Ittihadists and the Turkish government plan of destruction of the entire Armenian community. Then, the only thing which is the closest to what Ottomanreference attribute to that page is this following passage: Through the use of centralized planning and modern communication systems, all Armenians were to be assaulted. For the Turks, the sole question was: When? They did not have long to wait. In spring of 1915, Russian troops invaded Turkish territory following a failed Turkish offensive in the Caucasus. Sensing the opportunity, nationalist Armenians established a provisional government in the Russian-occupied era. Here was the proof of the """"internal enemy"""" the Turks had long claimed them to be, and Enver Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, did not hesitate to... Then the rest of the page relate to the destruction of the Armenians. This is also another example of a footnote not supporting the text it is supposed to source.  (ix) 

The book is at the state library; I have a very short note. It says; """"page 38, the setting of the provisional government"""". It was in the introduction section of the book about Holocaust (Jews) and talking about WWI in general. Next time; when I am at library, I will get the text. But if there was more than this, I would have it in my notes.

REVISED UPDATE: As far as I can tell, """"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"""" does not now appear on any list of anthems, national or otherwise. The links given above take you to List of anthems of UN member states, which has no mention of it, or National anthem, which has this little gem:
===For parts of states===
The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, amongst others, are notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" and these songs may be officially recognized.
14 of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union had their own official song which was used at events connected to that republic. The Russian republic used the USSR's national anthem. Some republics retained the melodies of those songs after the dissolution of the USSR (see the article National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics).
The United Kingdom's national anthem is """"God Save the Queen"""" but its constituent countries also have their own anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a number of songs which may be played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. The song usually played for England is """"God Save the Queen"""", though sometimes Jerusalem and Land of Hope and Glory may be played instead. Scotland has relatively recently adopted Flower of Scotland as its unofficial National Anthem, while Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century. Northern Ireland too has traditionally used """"God Save the Queen"""" though Londonderry Air is also used.
""""Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century"""", which is pretty good going - was it non-stop? No mention of the term """"national anthem"""" and the wording of the intro - notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" - plus the section heading """"parts of states"""" - clearly downgrades the status of Wales (and others).

"April 2008 (UTC)

 Thanks for the compliment! It's true, content is my main passion. I am happiest when doing lots of content creation/editing and community building, and I believe I do my best work when happy, and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. I tend to go through cycles in my editing. Recently, there's been a great deal of content creation that interests me, so that's what I've been most focused on. (A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders, which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community.) When I get less inspired on content, I tend to go on Recent changes patrol, jump into an XfD or RfA debate, etc. In my opinion, it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content, and make brief forays into administrative duties. I recognize that some hold differing views; to them I would say, it's essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use, other projects like Commons and Wikinews, deletion debates, mediation, etc. to act accordingly. I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff. I have nominated numerous articles for deletion, using speedy, PROD and AfD procedures; I don't know a good way to assess the results, but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. I do lots of vandalism reversion, and would estimate that I include subst'ed  templates about 80% of the time. I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR. I participate in CfD's and IfD's. I'm familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); I would not claim to know any by rote, but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.

 So, I would make no promises to be the most productive wielder of the mop, but I would make every effort to be well-informed and judicious in my use. I suppose my main use of the tools would to drift over to Category:Administrative backlog at the times that I presently look at recent changes, and do whatever needs doing. -  23:16, 24",0

We shouldn't be always asking for more more more.  We need to learn to find time and space to say """"that's enough for me, please help my fellow man"""".

1)  You don't believe in second chances

How can you not give a child who has never had a supportive dad, a clean mom, or a stable neighborhood to grow up on a second chance?  How can you not give a 16 year old girl who accidently got pregnant a second chance to live a normal life, rather than have an unwanted child who will never get the same love and support if it were to be born to a responsible parent?
2)  You hate or have no apathy for the poor
my comment is how can you have the poor and absolutely abhor any programs that help them if you have never been there yourself.  What would a rich upper class fellow like you know what its like to be starving and homeless on the streets of NYC or Miami after you have served your country in 2 different wars?

Show me where in the bible it said to take slaves out of the poor, black, and under privleged to feed the desires of the rich.  You talk about the bible so much, you forget the inherent meaning and underlying purpose for it.

Hello, Wood Dickinson. I will try to clarify a few issues. I hope doing so will be helpful to you. You have presumably seen the deletion log entry, otherwise you would not have known that I deleted the article. You will therefore have seen that the reason I deleted it was logged as """"Article that has no meaningful, substantive content"""". Indeed, the full and complete text that you posted was """"Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas. Developing entry for this film. I wrote it and produced as well. Wood Dickinson reference"""" followed by a URL. The deletion had nothing to do with copyright, nor did it indicate that I """"don't see any value"""" in having an article on the subject. The only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago. I expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject. Wikipedia does not have """"placeholder"""" articles waiting for content to be added, as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of Wikipedia, and a web page that says words to the effect """"we haven't written this page yet, but we will"""" does not produce a good impression. Instead, if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication, we keep it in a """"userspace"""" page: for example, if I were to write an article on that subject then I could create a page called User:JamesBWatson/Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas, and move it to Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas when it was ready.
I give up quite a significant amount of my time to Wikipedia administration. Unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism, trivia, propaganda, uninformed adolescent speculation, illegal content, and other unhelpful stuff. If there weren't people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess, Wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is. You are, of course, welcome to criticise any Wikipedia policy, and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision I take in the course of the work I do to help implement those policies, but I disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as """"trolling"""".

 RADIUS Question 

I'm taking a Security+ class right now and one of the questions in our book is this:

Which of the following cannot be used as a RADIUS client?
A) VPN server
B) Wireless access point
C) Network access server
D) Windows workstation

Now, the answer according to the book is D) Windows workstation, which we all agreed with. However, we don't know why. Any input would be nice. 

If your windows workstation had a GINA module that acted as a RADIUS client the answer could be all of the above.   

Things like this actually do exist and are used for some applications such as guest networks and cyber cafes.

 Wireless section? 

Is it just me, or does the following not make sense:

Although RADIUS was not initially intended to be a wireless security authentication method, it improves the WEP encryption key standard, in conjunction with other security methods such as EAP-PEAP.

RADIUS does not """"improve"""" on WEP; although auth credentials can be transmitted from the NAS/AP to the auth server using RADIUS, the underlying WEP security is still as vulnerable as it otherwise would be. 

Can we delete?

 

 Question - why UDP? 

It's always baffled me why RADIUS uses UDP and not TCP. UDP seems much better suited for streaming applications where the loss of a few packets is tolerable. A perfect example is streaming live video. But as a developer I can't see how these principals apply to what we're trying to achieve with the RADIUS protocol. Surely the overhead of TCP wouldn't have any scalability or performance issues on fast networks and modern hardware? Someone please enlighten me why they chose UDP for RADIUS.  

 Why UDP?  Answer 

RADIUS is designed to scale to large-scale deployments with dozens, maybe hundreds of BASs all talking occasionally to a couple of central servers. Given the underlying reliability of modern networks, the overhead of maintaining hundreds of open TCP connections would have been overkill. The alternative (open a connection each time a packet needs to be sent) would also have been inefficient (no point in performing a 3-way handshake for the sake of a single accounting update). On balance, UDP is probably the best choice.

Remember that RADIUS has built-in acknowledgement/retransmission mechanisms to cope with the occasional lost packet.

For a more flexible and robust protocol, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIAMETER.

 

Another reason is that when RADIUS was designed, it was possible to implement a UDP stack in a single embedded chip, but a TCP stack was more complicated (read: more expensive). This seems rather silly now, but it was a real problem designing cheap devices back then.

You can still find the same reasoning in SIP-phones  although SIP can be used both over UDP and TCP, a lot of vendors only implement the UDP part.

  

 Bulk Changes 

Commited some new text at the start to try and speak to what RADIUS is/does for those who don't have much knowledge of it and its associated soup of TLAs. Think it would be good to axe/move some of the existing text especially the paragraphs including and immediatly following 'Many networks services ('

Some ideas for new sections:

One focusing on each of the popular RADIUS auth protocols PAP,CHAP,MSCHAP,EAP..etc centralizing some scattered information.

A second on popular backend databases SQL, password files, LDAP..etc...in the spirit of whatever common practices there are for managing accounts.

Finally security focused protocol criticisms such as use of MD5/secret key lengths/""""Just use IPSec"""" a security/mitigation section might be helpful.

  

 Cleanup 
Over the next few days, I will spend some time to cleanup this article.  I am planning on adding three figures.  One showing a block diagram of RADIUS in an enterprise where dialup, VPN and Wi-Fi all use the same RADIUS server, a typical protocol stack and a block diagram of a roaming scenario where there is a proxy RADIUS server communicating with a remote RADIUS server connected by a PKI tunnel.

I have been deliberately not taking part in the current round of this debate because I have up till now had nothing new to add to it and to be frank, I didn't want to spend any more time on it.

Then someone else can smooth it along, or i may do so myself when I have more time, or after leaving the piece and re-reading it. It can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go, because you do not spot your mistakes. As to our last exchange in Severus Snape, yes I agree, I put in a clumsy statement, but I was trying to express a particular point. You improved the flow, but slightly altered my point. I changed it again, back a little to my original intention, though you also added something. Cheers.",0

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

I do not think that this sentence """"Kansas was also at the center of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, a 1954 Supreme Court decision that banned racially segregated schools throughout the U.S."""" belongs in a paragraph describing how progressive Kansas was.

 Kansas City MSA 
The Kansas City MSA is NOT a part of the state of Kansas. While some suburbs do spill into the state of Kansas, Kansas Citians pride themselves as being culturally independent from the state of Kansas. 60 percent of the MSA is located in Missouri, the airport is in MO, the tall buildings (downtown) is in MO, the sports stadiums are in MO and overall the entire metro is anchored in Missouri. It is the second largest MSA in Missouri, and is not part of kansas really at all. This needs to be deleted.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.246.231.23   

^^ The above comment was made by me. I forgot to log in. Kansas City is ANCHORED IN MISSOURI. Actually, Wichita has a larger MSA in the state of Kansas than Kansas City would even if you counted the numbers. JoCo adds about 500 thousand and the dotte is about 100 thousand. According to the article on Wichita, there are 680,000 in their metro. Therefore, Wichita is larger in terms of metro strictly in KS (even though Kansas City's MSA is four times larger) Kansas City is a missouri metro not a Kansas one.""",0

Thanks for that tip. Yes, I will learn how to use it, since everything I do uses math - I mean when I am not fighting off rabid currs nipping at my cuffs. Can one put pictures and sound in as well?

Yes, back to Uncle Ed. There are matters of general policy here:

1. Defamatory words like """"crank"""", """"kook"""", """"crackpot"""" should be banned by Wikipedia as they are literally used in the commission of hate crimes against dissident minorities. They EMOTIONALLY mean the same as """"Kike"""", """"Nigger"""", """"FAGGOT"""" et-al. I and others like Nobel Prize winner Brian Josephson are persecuted for daring to write about the paranormal, about consciousness, about UFOS, about cold fusion (Brian's interest). We are automatically stereotyped as """"kooks"""" by clueless fearful generally intellectual inferiors who mistake their inability to understand what is on the page as our fault. Rather than they rising to us, we are to stoop to their low level of achievement and keep away from Taboo Topics. Is that a Free Society? How is that better than 7th Century Talabanism? We dissident physicists and there are many in the closet are treated as second-class citizens without the same rights that the majority like CH pretends to stand for keep for themselves in a double standard.
One can say """"Jack Sarfatti's ideas are highly original and advanced and not easily understood by the majority of people who reject them."""" Something like that is accurate. If one says something negative then they must justify it with a precise quote with a name otherwise it is simply vicious defamation. It is simply a hate crime on the WEB. We live in a SYMBOLIC INFO NATION in CYBERSPACE. Words are everything. WORDS are WEAPONS! Soon Internet Law will evolve and the kinds of defamations of my character seen on these pages by dillettantes will be judged as HATE CRIMES like beating up a Gay Man or lynching a Black Man used to be.  How can anyone reading my words, looking at my math, so insult me as to call me a such words as """"crank"""". Why not say what you really mean deep down which is """"Jack Sarfatti is a Jew""""? Do I sound like Shylock in The Merchant of Venice?

2. Flaky internet sources like Alt.Kooks, Crank.Dot.Net should not be cited to debase and humiliate anyone deemed worthy enough to have a page in Wiki. They are cultural PORNOGRAPHY of no redeeming social value.

3. Critiques should be COMPETENT, as DSiegel's is not when he cites Martin Gardner. A solid TEXTUAL justification is required like one must do as a grad student learning to do PhD research.

The basic issue here is QUALITY CONTROL, ACCURACY, FAIRNESS, JUSTICE.

Where do you see Dennis saying """"step it up""""?  The only thing close to that is his comment here to 'bump it up', which is clearly referring to DRN, the Wikipedia:Dispute resolution noticeboard which is a step in the overall Wikipedia Dispute Resolution process; and it is very clear that User:BeCritical understands that Dennis is talking about the WP:DR process, because BeCritical actually refers to Arbitration, followed by Dennis mentioning WP:RFC/U and Wikipedia:Arbitration.  """"Stepping it up"""" and/or """"bumping it up"""" has nothing to do with a suggestion to go to more extreme behavior in an attempt to elicit a sanctionable reaction from you.  Nor do any of the other comments by Dennis even suggest such a thing be done, or has been done.

This paragraph in the introduction consists of two completely unrelated subjects. The 250th anniversary is already mentioned later in the article, so this sentence can probably be removed. The historic district sentence, then, could be incorporated somewhere else in the article. In fact, it is mentioned in the """"20th century to present"""" section so maybe we can move it there. I will make these changes tomorrow if no one objects.

Also, as I mentioned in my edit comment, I think the word """"semiquincentennial"""" should be removed. If a word is so obscure that you have to clarify what it means, why not just use the clarification instead? It looks a like a case of using a big word for the sake of using a big word.

TCP is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.   The Internet was built on the TCP/IP model  OSI refines it into its own spec.  If you want to write about these things in the article, Great!

UNBLOCK: 1. The reason I used sockpuppets was to avoid harassment from user: Dibo who immediately reverted all my edits, ,  and  when I forgot to log and branded me a sockpuppet of some previous user, here  which the checkuser proved did not exist . I got into a revert war with user: Tancred and user: Dibo who from the contributions, seemed to devote their time exclusively to making trouble and aiding each other in edit wars, as is shown here, ,  as well as in the earlier case regarding user: Ehinger222 who they erroneeouslly accused me of being.

Tancred has a history of edit wars, exemplified no better than here. I was banned by user: Chuq although my last free edits from here were this , , my last was this .  is where I made an argument for my case for the A-League case.

I felt I was hard done by and resolved to annoy the blockers as much as they had annoyed me before resuming as my previous identity and making a large number of useful contributions before being bogged down by a piece of shit like user:Dibo who provoked this whole encounter. User:Dibo and User:tancred are the ones who should be banned if any justice is to be done, and I am resolved upon annoying the whole lot of you unless I am unblocked and the usefullness of my <500 edits is acknowledged as actual contributions and user:dibo recognised as the edit warrer that he/she/ it is.",0

 Hopefull. 

Dear User:Addhoc, I am hopeful, regarding the appeal for Justice made by User:Lakki Marwat. You are having good record impression and pleasant attitude. Otherwise I am hopeless to make a plea to most of the Administrators on WP, as it is hard to achieve justice by them. As you are a senior member of WP:KC, you must be kind to me, even if I am wrong. So you correct me in a lovely manner, as a human deserves to be corrected in such a way.

Here I must tell you one thing humbly, that I don't want to discuss the edits on the article Marwat. I believe the edits should be into discussion at article’s discussion page. Where no one likes to discuss but keep on approaching administrations for their help.

Anyhow, I just would like to make you know one thing, by drawing your attention towards article Marwat that is vandalise by one of the fellow who is having almost similar username to article. 

If you visit the Discussion Page of article Marwat, you will find a paragraph (#19), written by User:Marwatt. In that paragraph (#19), heading and first line is written in pure Pashto Language (the headline and first-line is quoted below in bold). 

( Quoted )

Kasam Pe Khduai Ka de rana We Lekal

Ter so pore che ze zamdai yem, Wala ka rana Akhtar Munir ya nor fazoolyat pe de article che wachai. (End of Quoting)

The menaiong of these two lines is """"That I vow to God, that I won't let you write"""". """"Till I am alive, I swear upon Allah (God), you can't mention the name of Akhter Munir in this article"""" 

Addhoc, doesn’t this means that this is a challenge and there is a personal enmity, political enmity besides this editing (vandalism)? 

See the discussion page of that article, User:Marwatt is fail to defend his edit/deletes, clearly.

If you take an interest in resolving the dispute and """"issue"""" of editing for article Marwat, I am sure the page will get a rest and updating instead of being a battleground for my fellows.

 Mormonism and history merge proposal 
Storm, I saw your note on Trodel's page and wanted to touch base.  I am definately against merging, primarily because placing the topic in History of the Latter Day Saint movement reduces it to a """"one time"""" issue.  The most recent pattern of """"faith-promoting"""" history was (as a BYU trained historian, I sincerely hope) a one time event.  But Mormonism and history is a much bigger topic, closer to historiography, having implications from Joseph's time to the present.  I don't know if this is the right title for such an article, but we are having a restructuring discussion on the Mormonism and history page.  Please drop in and give your two cents.  And, besides, there is certainly little room for more material in History of the Latter Day Saint movement!  Best wishes as always.    """,0

I am pleased that others have joined this enquiry but I am already dismayed to find that someone has found it necessary to sweep the """"Jewish Question"""" under the carpet when reference on this Talk page had already been made to one incident involving a """"Final Solution"""" of the Jews in England. I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called """"Race laws"""" of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.

Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.

What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)

So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)

The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (""""they killed Jesus""""). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!

Now move along to 1297 and """"bingo!"""" = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in """"ethnic cleansing"""" by wholesale murder and mayhem.

Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)

The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say """"me too"""" (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  16:12, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)""",0

 TTP: """"They are not affiliated with the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar who are supported by the Pakistani army and state."""" 

Hi, while I agree for the most part with the above statement, I have to take issue with a little bit of the wording, as petty as that may seem.  I believe that stating that the two groups have no """"direct"""" affiliation would be clearer.  Reference #6 indicates that at some level they do have some sort of affiliation although they are both independent of one another.

Also, the source cited regarding Pakistani support for the Afghan Taliban only alludes to incidents prior to the US invasion of Afghanistan.  However, Reference #6 (from 2009) does indicate more current coordination between elements within the ISI and the Afghan Taliban.  I am going to modify the statement slightly to reflect these two points.

GA review process

Well, the review process was instructive, as were the comments regarding how to improve the article. I had no idea that it was wrong to approach individual editors to comment (as I explained above it was to """"get the ball rolling"""" – naivety on my part, I'm afraid). I also think that Pyrotec's choice of language here (""""This review looks very much like a """"favour"""" being granted to the article's nominator by a co-conspirator"""") is very regrettable – perhaps he would like to retract it, look again at the six editors I asked to review the article (I chose a cross-section of editors experienced in CC pages but who had not made a contribution here – also explained above), and admit that he jumped to conclusions. Another example of why good faith is so important. Anyway in future, I'll just make a general post on the talk page about GA nominations. 
From the comments re: the article itself it's clear that the article needs work in certain areas. Specifically:
MOS issues, esp. with regard to the synopsis
Restructuring of criticism section and dealing with """"stubby paragraphs""""
Consistency in spelling 
Overlong sentences in synopsis (although Guetterda's criticism """"the synopsis is written in a narrative form - x happened, then the author introduced y, then z happened - which is inappropriate for the synopsis of a book of this form"""" may be misplaced as the book is a chronological account of this subject) 
Delingpole's review quoted in the lead but not the main body
 Further critical review needed/possible problems with tone
 Needs more images

That should be enough to be getting along with)) I don't regard the rejection as a setback, but merely a blip on the road to getting The Real Global Warming Disaster to GA status one day, in strict compliance with WP guidelines, though I still have reservations about how wise it was to choose a book from this subject area.

"""What I was saying was that South Africa was never a """"black"""" country. The indigenous people were the Khoikhoi and the San(Capoids) who lived there for hundreds of thousand of years all alone. In the 15th century white Europeans arrived, and steadily built a civilization, dispossessing the native Khoisan. Only during the 18th and 19th centuries did the first blacks enter South Africa as settlers, invaders, and unwilling labourers. They outbred the indigenous Khoisan and the native whites to the point where the ruling white people who had built everything and anything resembling a civilisation or a modern state realised that they could lose their country to these non-indigenous people who rejected the very essence of that civilisation itself and refused to assimilate. So the official policy was apartness...apartheid. At the time everyone was happy with that, until millions more black people swet in, because their independent Black African states slid into Third World states in rapid succession. Meanwhile the local black population continued to have one of the highest birthrates in the world. The ANC, PAC, SACP etc were ALL funded by, and ruled from Soviet Moscow. The head of the ANC was never Tambo or Mandela, but rather East European Marxists. ALL weaponry, money, even idealogy came not from Soweto but Moscow. The obssessive terrorist war led to the end of white rule, and the rise of a FOREIGN-BORN black population who now represented the majority through relentless immigartion, murder, terrorism and an unnatural reproductive rate. At Mandela's inaugaration the Oppenheimers etc were there to let him know who was REALLY calling the shots. And since, """"independecne"""" and black rulse, South africa has deteriorated at a shocking rate.

Getaway: Thank you for your comments. I most certainly did give my reasons  Read my previous comment. What you didn't do is raise any points on the discussion page before making changes. As for your charges:

1) FAIR and Media Matters are certainly media watchdogs, even though they're political. All media watchdogs are political. Rush Limbaugh is political. That doesn't make any of their views invalid, but it does call for balance. 

2) Phrases like """"axe to grind"""" serve no function in intelligent debate. It would be equally pointless to argue that Limbaugh has an """"axe to grind."""" He does, and I don't have a problem with that. He has every right to have an axe to grind here in the land of free speech, and so do FAIR and Media Matters. Having an axe to grind is just one way to say somebody takes a certain political position. Limbaugh's positions are one POV of a partisan debate and FAIR's are another. Their axes, excuse me, their views need to be balanced. By the way, I don't know as much about Media Matters as about FAIR, but FAIR makes no claim to be """"neutral and nonpartisan"""" as you suggest. What they claim is to be accurate. You're welcome to challenge that accuracy, with sources. Which leads to my next point:

3) It's very easy to toss out weasel words like """"MM and FAIR both have long records of inaccuracy"""" but you're not providing any evidence that their charges against Limbaugh are fallacious or inaccurate. Judging from Limbaugh's feeble response to FAIR's charges, we might be tempted to conclude that Limbaugh can't answer FAIR because FAIR got it right. If there's a problem with FAIR's accuracy, you're welcome to include it, with sources, in the paragraph. (I've issued this invitation three times already and nobody has taken me up on it.) But you do not get to blindly assert that FAIR isn't a credible source without any evidence to back you up, and you don't get to water down what I've written just because you don't like FAIR's work or because you can't find sources to back up your position.

4) FAIR isn't merely expressing opinion. It's documenting errors of fact. Please don't confuse opinion with fact, they're not the same thing at all. When Limbaugh claims that suspending rules on minority hiring will make earthquake repairs go quickly, he's stating an opinion. But when Limbaugh says the government suspended rules on minority hiring, he's making a statement of fact. FAIR is taking issue with Limbaugh's facts. 

5) I'm not asking for special treatment for FAIR. I'm asking that, as per NPOV rules, their view get equal treatment. Are you asking for special treatment for Limbaugh's views? 

6) Please focus on substance? I am. I feel it's important to provide a historical perspective on this controversy, and I feel the article needs to illustrate of the depth and scope of the controversy, which is provided by the Media Matters quote. I also feel this section needs a defining introductory sentence. For these reasons, I'm restoring much of the previous text. If you disagree, please take issue with me on this page. 

BTW I feel that Allen3 made a useful clarifying edit in an earlier revision, when he labeled FAIR a """"progressive"""" organization, and provided a link to an article. I find that much more accurate than """"Liberal,"""" since FAIR keeps its distance from classic liberalism, and sometimes takes issue with people who call themselves Liberal. Can we keep the """"Progressive"""" label?  """,0

I didn't make a personal attack, first of all.  I reverted that section because for a moment I thought I was on the """"Crucifixion"""" page and not the """"Crucifixion in Art"""" Page, and therefore when I realized my mistake, I realized that yes, in fact Anime can be considered relevant to this page, so I took out a portion where I said it didn't belong in this article.  I didn't make any personal attacks, I made a general statement that Anime Fans who think that Anime is culturally relevant to anyone but them really need to grow up.  I justified that by stating that even in its country of origin, it's irrelevant and viewed as immature Children's Programming.
Second, I think I did make my case.  Self-censorship is not actually censorship.  If I choose not to say something because I'm afraid of the backlash, nobody has censored me, so claiming that 'Westerners have censored completely justifiable depictions of crucifixion in anime' when in fact, it was the companies that censored themselves does nothing except engender a victim mentality among Anime Fans.

I don't know if this is still the case but as far as I know, the problem hasn't been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot, 1UP, Gamasutra, etc. People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users, it isn't nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and it's notability has therefore not been so strongly established.

There were no diesel car engines on the domestic Soviet market. Soviet diesels were designed for tanks and army trucks, not consumer cars. I did find a Russian source that says 21045 is using modern (licensed??) VAZ-343 diesel engine made in Barnaul, but it seems the producion of this car is very low, for testing purposes mostly; you can't find it in dealerships outside Togliatti. I'm just too lazy to incorporate lots of this and other useful information available on many Russian sites. Sorry.
The source for the names is the official corporate history of the VAZ, http://history.vaz.ru/cars/ Numeric model numbers like Lada 1200SL were the most used internationallly, and the Soviet """"AutoExport Corp."""" wouldn't be so flexible to appoint different naming schemes for each market, maybe excluding some major ones like the UK. I don't see any point in removing model names. Noone should remember all those crazy manufacturer codes, that's too much for cars that all are based on the Fiat 124 and differ only by say front fascia, like 21063 to 21033.
Don't bother with the Kalina, it's getting mostly mediocre reviews even from the loyal press. The promises were high but the build quality seems to stay on a level typical to VAZ (see The Object of Jokes) and the parts quality is not catching up. The sales of VAZ cars are falling since last year while the sales of foreign cars are increasing, and no further raise of the import tax will help if the VAZ won't improve, but just don't seem to be able to, as shown by the fiasco of their efforts to adapt Chevrolet Niva for export. They'd better license some designs from GM Daewoo, quick, while GM is still not afraid to lose their image once and forever.

At first pass, this looks quite good. It's comprehensive, well sourced, and well written, and seems generally ripe for promotion. I've made a few tweaks as I went; feel free to revert any with which you disagree.

I'd suggest splitting the lead into two paragraphs for readabilityperhaps at """"Increased expenses and decreasing ridership""""?
""""with two railroad stations in operation, one on the C&O; line and the Union Station just west of the C&O; station at the junction between the C&O; and Southern railroads""""  I found this part of the sentence hard to follow at first glance; maybe break this off as a second sentence: """"two railroad stations in operation. One was on the C&O; line, and the second, the Union Station, was just west..."""" Am I understanding the meaning correctly in this rewrite?
""""Development of the streetcar system""""  I'd suggest breaking this long paragraph into at least two for readability (Perhaps at """"this continued until..."""")
Route Description  split large paragraph for readability
Two statements here that it would be better to fix in time per WP:REALTIME for clarity in the long-term:
To address these issues, the city has begun planning and analyzing various methods of public transportation for implementation within Charlottesville, one of which includes the development of a streetcar system. (""""in the early 2000s, the city began..."""")
 though no concrete plans have been developed or implemented (""""as of 2012"""")

""", and use the confusing, redundent, yet common phrase """"North America*""""... *not refering to the continent. 

Either of two reasons:
A desire to place the United States last on the list, by manipulating the names of regions to exploit the """"fair"""" use of alphabetization to make the US hard to find.
Simply an oversight.  

Well, nobody replied so I renamed the section on Territories and regions to U.N. subregions. It's amazing that this list puts the United States last, even though it has most of the people and 1/3 of the area. Is someone trying to """"de-emphasize"""" America's importance?  

No it's just in alphabetical order.  

 Talk about... 

Any info in this article about the use of the term as if it meant exclusively Canada and the United States??  

Yes: in the 'Human geography' section, namely the 3rd paragraph.  Other related terms are also treated in that sxn.   | talk | 

 Central Americans are not North Americans! 

We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can """"undeclare himself"""". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. """"North America"""" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think """"North American"""" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast",0

>Hello Beaumont,I noticed that you have recently joined the Dzierzon discussion and especially Dzierzon's self-identification. You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].
What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?
>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.
Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).
>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.
It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. Dzierzon
>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.
The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.
>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.
You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.
>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.
I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.
>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.
The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.
>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? 
In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? 
>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.
The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: """"Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia"""" which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.
Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, Polakiem
z urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia. Ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”
Original in Museum of. J. Dzierżona in Kluczborku, sygn. 35, 14, 11 Folge, Zur Charakteristik Dr. J. Dzierzon.

I reluctantly consult a copy of the 4th edition (a recent one, though not the latest) of the boring MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers.

It might be releavent to mention that this Mr. yellow Up seems to have a consistent policy of hounding me and trying to get rid of whatever I write which does not fit his political opinions, he does it also in the Hebrew Wikipedia. 
There are some more points which I thought of. The argument of Yellow Up that """"This is just one of thousands of trials against military evaders"""" which was rpeated by Danntm """"just a simple, unimportant court-martial"""" is factually not true. It is very exceptional for the IDF to grant a political objector a full court martial where he can be defended by a lawyer and call witnesses (and make political speeches). It does not happen more often than once in a decade. The usual procedure is """"disciplinary proceedings"""" where you are judged by a commaning officer in his bureau, with no lawyer or witnesses, and it lasts about five minutes - but the officer can only give a maximum of 28 days, unlike the full court martial which can give years. But the descision to have a full court martial is far from routine, it is taken on the highest levels. Then there is the fact that the act which the trial was about - a soldier writing """"subversive"""" graffiti of 117 tanks and other military vehicles - is far from routine, it is certainly unique in Israel and I think quite exeptional for armies worldwide. And finally, Majorly jusitifed the decision to delete by stating """"The vast majority were delete comments, and there seemed to be consensus to delete"""" . Now, I took a look at the deletion log of article submitted on January 8 together with mine . As far as I could see, virtually all of those which were fianlly deleted had a real ovewhelming majoroity in favor, many of them complete unanimity. The court martial artcile had nine in favor of deletion against five opposing deletion (if you don't count my own objection, with it there would be nine to six).  I saw that another article which was put up for deleteion in nearly the same time Arnie_Ginsburg, the result was  """"no concensus, default keep"""".

 Troubling aspects of the artiicle as it exists right now 

1) I believe if Eric Altermann is to be accorded the prestige of being associated with msnbc.com, it should be noted that he is a blogger for msnbc.com. I say that because I found conservative columnist and author Michelle Malkin referred to as a blogger in another article and I do believe that's meant to diminish the value of her statement. So, again, yes. We HAVE to see the forest for the trees. No one article in Wikipedia exists in a vaccum. There has to be a baseline standard and I reject any argumentation that suggests implies or directs that if 'I don't like that article, go change it.' Instead, one way or the other (and I don't care which way) liberals and conservatives have to be characterized by the same fair measuring stick.

2) This is new. It's from Conason: """"Conason goes on to point out that Coulter's critical nature is blunted by her pre-assumed opinions, making many of the conclusions she draws irrelevant to the actual nature of her arguments."""" Wow! That seems a little unfair just hanging out there like that. I propose either eliminating it or...and I hate this approach as much as the next guy...scotch-taping a quote after that which refutes this obvious cheap-shot.

3) This is old. The McVeigh section, as should be no surprise to anyone who's followed my work here, is troubling. Let's start with this quote: """" She was willing to characterize members of the Branch Davidians at the Waco compound as """"harmless American citizens"""" [6] even after the survivors of the raid and subsequent immolation of the group by their leader were convicted.""""
Well, some Waco compounders were convicted of something or another. But the fact is that there WERE mostly innocent victims of David Koresh in that compound. It's unbalanced to just add the tag line about conviced Davidians without acknowledging what I GUARANTEE you Ann was referring to, which were the overwhelming number that were innocent. 

This quote is also troubling: """"Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his bombing."""" Well, McVeigh had LOTS of reasons for his bombing. But who cares what a madman thinks? And if you do, then I understand he also had some uncomplimentary things to say about the Bible. Therefore, if we are to include this in Coulter's section, I say we include it's compelement in Bill Maher's article. It would go something like this:
""""Naher has frequently criticized the Bible calling it a 'bunch of fairy tales' and claiming 'God doesn't write books.'  Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh made similar criticism as partial justification for his distrust of Christianity, though the Bible has been widely criticized throughout history.""""

Whady'a say?

(Much more on this section later.)

4) Racism is not the same as being anti-Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans for supporting Israel etc. To title Ann's comments on Islamic Radicals as allegations of racism seems dishonest to me.

5) Did Ann really say that ALL  women are """"not as bright"""" as men'?
Some editor in Wikipedia wants us to think so. I say this quote be taken out until we get confirmation of her whole statement in context. Now, I know for a fact that Ann is only half-joking when she argues women should not be allowed to vote so she is far from imune when it comes to suggesting she holds less-than-boilerplate-feminist views. But this quote supposedly out of H & C seems like it's probably another smear. Again, if proven wrong, I'll gladly man up and stand corrected. But, unitl I'm proven it wrong, it should be excised in my view.

Well, my point is that Navarre (for example) has indoubtly links to the Basque Country (some parts do speak basque, some historical links...) and even have another association much related to the IRL called EUSKARA KULTUR ELKARGOA. But that doesn't mean we should link both regions in the same basket. The navarrese government has never expressed any intention of reducing its own political or social identity, the same way Andorra, Balears or Valencia haven't either. Participating in a single cultural project such as the IRL, doesn't mean that suddenly those territories have renounced to their own identities (so close or so distanct to the Catalan proper). We are not even explaining that it is just a part of the population which may be considered as catalans... We are not talking about the spanish-speakers (around 50% of all the inhabitants of these regions), the french-speakers or simply all the foreigners living for years in these territories:

Balearic Islands: 21% of the total pop. (that's 224K)
Catalonia: 15% of the total pop. (that's 1,1 million)
Valencia: 17,7% of the total pop. (that's 866K)

They sum up as 2,2 million people who don't consider themselves neither Catalan nor Valencian nor Balearic. Then, add the national population which don't speak a word of the language (2,6 million link) or even the ones who can speak it but don't use it as primary language (it roses up to around 50% of the total pop.)...

So, because of that, I keep thinking that putting ALL the inhabitants of these territories (or just the name of the regions) in the same basket is so so so """"dangerous""""... We are talking about figures ranging between 30% and 50% of people who may have a much doubtly catalanity... And that's a LOT of people. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). """,0

Boy, this is the most understated thing I've read here on Wikipedia.  While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.  Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another, and some decidedly non-Mormon communities as well.  The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City, South Dakota.

In addition, a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah, including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the """"Mormons"""" and the """"Gentiles"""" during the territorial days of Utah.  Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.

Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here.  The LDS Church owned the store lock, stock, and barrel.  And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.

"""== Audio File ==

DCGeist is vandalising this article by repeatedly removing content while refusing to exaplin the problem or start a discussion to correct the problem.  The problem, he says, is """"style"""", which he believes """"very clearly explains the problem"""".  He prefers to delete content rather than help to edit the page to allow its inclusion.  Is United States to be the only country in the Western Hemisphere without an audio file for pronunciation of the name? 

When did """"style"""" become so important that it justifies the deletion of content over style correction?   

The addition is ungrammatical.
It clutters the article's opening sentence. It is visually off-putting and difficult to read. This is a very significant stylistic concern; by contrast, the addition of an audio clip pronouncing two common English words is a minor and unnecessary matter of content.—  

 Could you explain why you think the addition is ungrammatical in the parenthetical comment?  Do you have a proposed solution that will avoid deleting content, or is deleting content your purpose?  The opening can be reworded, rather than deleting content.  Please note that the pronunciation, even of """"common"""" words in English is of value to both non-native speakers as well as native-born speakers, since even common words may change pronunciation within a proper name.  Please justify having only one country in North America whose article is forbidden to contain an audio file.   

While remaining mostly neutral on this front, please don't call something """"vandalism"""" when it's not. This is a disagreement, and under the terms of """"Bold, Revert, Discuss"""", the onus is actually now upon you to justify its inclusion, not the other way around. But either way, it's not obvious vandalism. It annoys admins when people throw that term around. Or at least me. And as for """"Is United States to be the only country in the western hemisphere"""", I point out that """"United States"""" is the only country name in the Western hemisphere made up entirely of common words, without proper names. (""""of America"""" is different, of course, but the audio file isn't about that name) So there is an argument to say that it is the country least in need of a pronunciation guide, since there's no unusual or proper words in that particular name.   

But """"united"""" contains vowels which do not behave in the way that non-native speakers expect.  I have taught English overseas, and have seen the problems firsthand.  The word """"united"""" has no encyclopedia article here, nor pronunciation given, for a non-native speaker to examine.  Also, the word """"states"""" is a plural, and English plurals have two possible pronunciations for the added final """"-s"""": /s/ or /z/, according to rules that native speakers learn but which non-native speakers struggle with.

Announcement
I have compared Helga's original version and Helga's condensed version to each other as promised.  To be fair, Helga only claimed to have condensed, and not re-written the article.  in this, she is completely correct.  The problem, however, is that this condensation in no way makes the article less of a copyright violation.  As written, there is no way that this should be included on the site, IMO.  I have included the article below, with questions and comments(in bold) that I think must be answered in order to make the article useful and not just another way of trying to prove that Copernicus was Prussian.  That said, I really think that this deserves no more than a couple of lines in the Copernicus article.  Thanks all for bearing with me and helping make this work.  Helga, plese help out by answering the questions   and perhaps even doing a bit more research  so that we can work together to make this a well-written, meaninful, article. 

Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin Reform

Nicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn. 

This really isn't a position, I don't think  he wasn't hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...

In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici...
In what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn't make much sense  

Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform. 
Again, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?

The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused. 
Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.  

There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty . 

This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions: 

What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?  
Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family)
How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights?
'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.  They, like rich bankers like the Fuggers and Welsers, used their economic sway as much as possible to influence th",0

 Please help regarding diacritics in Indian mythological names 

Can you please help me regarding the use of diacritics in Indian mythological names used in articles? I am trying to find a policy page (if it exists) on the usage of names that have diacritics in other articles. Some articles include the diacritic information when   non-English words are used while others don't mention them. This sometimes leads to incorrect pronunciation. For eg: in this article Vishvamitra, """"Puthrakameshti"""" is mentioned in the section """"Kaushika"""". In """"Puthrakameshti"""" the first """"a"""" is short while the second """"a"""" is long thereby requiring a diacritic. As you can see, the diacritic is not used in any part of this article. But in this article Valmiki it is used, """"kāṇḍas"""". Do you know if a policy page exists on this? 

What is a nice balance between making it simple and following proper pronunciation? If I include diacritics on every previously unspecified non-English (in this case, mainly Sanskrit) word it would become difficult to read the article. The other extreme is also not very desirable.

Thanks a lot. """,0

"up, Martinez decided to law low from the city for a while, but eventually came back to mess with Vic’s woman, Louise. Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld.

The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise. In the future, if you make assertions like, “You claim that """"Confucius' Analects is, in regard to music, criticism""""; but the reference that you quote in support of your claim utterly fails to actually support it, because it merely never speaks of criticism,” please cite a reference to support your argument. Your continuing argument that a thing cannot be accepted as theoretical unless it specifically uses the word “theory” is similarly problematic because it is not supported anywhere that I can find.

I understand that Ono. These reports ( of abuse etc.) are the central reason for the person's notability in international media. So we can't gloss them over either.

Second academic analysis of teachings etc ( for instance Lawrence Babb.) etc are just objective academic analysis - we should not be labeling them as praise or criticism. If there are positive things said about the person in reputable third party sources - we obviously shouldn't gloss them over either.

Presenting objective content in the so called """"miracles"""" section, etc. are again not criticism in itself.

[I was asked to contribute here by Faendalimas.] I have no knowledge of the background to the two genus names in question. There are, however, some obvious problems with the article's current text. Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced, and editorial opinions and recommendations are given. I don't think there can be any justification for including editorialising like """"The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play"""" or leading statements like """"The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is 'science' or just 'politics', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells' name for this taxon"""". We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether """"W. dorsei"""" warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like """"this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]"""", where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn't mention the case in question) – this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the """"genus currently contains five [...] species"""", but only four are listed.

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

 User Narking 2 

Ok, so I see he has made many lies. 
1. The Encyclopaedia of Ukraine is the best source for Ukraine on the English language.
2. It is written by Ukrainians. 
3. The figure I provided IS the most """"mainstream view"""" of Ukrainians, since it stands in the Ukrainian encyclopaedia.. Also, the Ukrainian article of the battle of Poltava supports my view, both in Swedish Casualties AND Swedish strength. 
4. The Swedish Historian's figures are the mainstream among Swedish historians. 
5. Russian imperial figures ARE NOT Soviet figures. The Figueres in the Soviet encyclopaedia are historic estimates as well. Also, the Soviet encyclopaedia is underestimated. Many Swedes think it is just a book of lies, but it is actually a valuable source, and is frequently used to determine casualties in wiki articles, particularly Russian (like in the siege of Sevastopol).   
6. The cute thing now is, that Narking tries to turn ME as the bad guy. All I did was write the Ukrainian POW, and he removed it, arrogantly stating: """"Stop confusing the reader!"""". This is how the entire arguments started.
7. The battle of Grengam article is only a mess in his head. Look at it admin, please. I also see that it has been changed into an even better one, after the editing of another user. 
8. I request that the user Narking is banned from editing Battle of Poltava and Battle of Grengam if he continues with his annoying, and vandalizing edits. 

Umm, one word. PROOF. Until you actually have any sort of backing (at ALL), your argument is empty air. And why is not the Ukrainian view allowed?

 Answer to my question re: web site for both sides controversial issues 

I'm interested in a wide range of issues.  I tend to be liberal politically and enjoy discussing issues with some conservative friends.  On some issues I have made up my mind but would like to understand the other side.  On other issues, I'd like to get more information or at least a good starting point of the the key points of both sides and places to looks further.  going on an issue-by-issue basis is OK but very time consuming. Also, you get a lot of misleading information by looking at sites that promote their point of view. it would be great if there was a web site that had already done this.  Like having an intelligent person research each issue and then give you a one-page summary like """" Here's the issue, here are the two or three main sides, here's the philisophical underpinning for each side, and here are the main points each side makes, backed up by these references.""""

Thomas Nelson, Sr.

Does anyone know whether or not Mr. Thomas Nelson, Sr., age 111, currently residing in Texas, formerly of Louisiana, served in the military before, during or after World War I?  Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.

Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:-
There are 13 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?

Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards). 

Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?

Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {yakłtalk} 

""""Doesn't strike you?""""  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.   

I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?

One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment. 

Silas Simmons?

Who is Silas Simmons?

Silas Simmons was born Oct 14 1895, according to his WWI draft card:

Name: Silas Joseph Simmons 
City: Philadelphia  
County: Philadelphia  
State: Pennsylvania  
BirthPlace: Delaware  
Birth Date: 14 Oct 1895  
Race: African  
Roll: 1907647  
DraftBoard: 27  

→  {yakłtalk} 

http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml

Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.

He is not on the GRG list because the 1900 census lists him as born in '1897' (which would make him 'only' 108, instead of 110 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {yakłtalk} 

This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.  Do we know whether Mr. Simmons loaded ships as a civ",0

off-hand comment by Ludwigs2
The problem here, brangifer, and the thing that (as an academic) annoys me the most, is that you are doing something that no scholar would ever do.  You are starting from a pre-defined judgement (i.e., that anything not-science is bad) and working your way backwards to find supporting evidence for that position.  One can always find someone reputable, somewhere, who says what one already believes - ufologists do that all the time, cherry-picking quotes from scientists and government agencies -  but it's bad scholarship to do so.  You want so desperately to believe that the scientific community agrees with your radically skeptical position that you're grasping at straws.  That's not the way things are done.  Ludwigs2 """,0

Second half, Sudoghost:  I had done so beforehand.  I guess I should back up and explain the whole thing.

The dispute is about the scheduling of matches on Wrestlemania XXVIII.  The original list had one match, The Rock vs. John Cena, which was agreed to in a promo the Monday after Wrestlemania XXVII, the first time such a thing had been done that far in advance.

Fast forward to July 17, 2011, where Daniel Bryan, largely seen as a too-small wrestler with no personality in a federation trying to distance itself from """"wrestling"""", won the Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match.  This won him, in storyline, the unilateral right to a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at any point over the next year.  Last Friday (aired  it actually was taped on Tuesday), he announced that he would cash in that title opportunity at Wrestlemania XXVIII.  http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2011-07-22/results was the source I used.  WWE also has an interview up with Bryan now which was not up when I made the edit.

My issue is that, since the Money in the Bank winner can choose to cash his briefcase any time, he had chosen to do so at Mania XXVIII  and at that moment, became a scheduled match for WrestleMania XXVIII.  Ruth is using the Mr. Kennedy situation to claim that match probably will not take place (Kennedy (now Mr. Anderson, a previous MitB winner, wanted to do the same thing (cash at Wrestlemania), but was quickly unseated by Edge, cancelling that match).  The problem with this is two-fold:  One, it presumes (WP:Crystal, again!) that Bryan will, because he is not seen favorably by Vince McMahon (nor by many WWE marks), lose not only his briefcase but his real-life place on the WWE roster by Mania XXVIII.  Two, if me putting that match up is WP:Crystal, then so, at this early date, is Rock-Cena.  Ruth claims she has WWE travel packages which have already advertised Rock-Cena for Mania XXVIII, but has consistently refused to reference them.  She claims exactly what JaC stated above as sufficient to not only keep Rock-Cena, but remove Bryan from the card AND silence me from saying otherwise!

So I went to the WP:Crystal page and applied the relevant clause. Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. Dates are not definite until the event actually takes place. If preparation for the event is not already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented.  The event, by the WWE Universe, is notable (it's a Smackdown main event for the largest card of the year for the company), is at least as certain to take place (at the moment) as Rock-Cena (and if that fact changes, we can change the Mania XXVIII page when it does), and the documentation is on WWE's own website, which I provided you.

I believe Ruth is a typical WWE mark, like this other *mumblemumblemumble* up here, and believes that Daniel Bryan is not worthy of even a WWE contract.  I believe her stand is prejudicial, selective, and wrong.  Good faith went out the door about 15 posts ago.  And I do NOT believe in consensus if the consensus is demonstratably wrong!   """,0

 Really tangled paragraph 

The conception of a right to something that implicitly creates an obligation on someone else to provide that thing (a positive right) is widely challenged.  You can not enforce your wish for something (under the auspices of a right) if it implicitly constitutes an obligation on another to do something for you.  However, one person's right to something creates a negative right in that you have the right for that thing not be interfered with by another, and that other is obligated not to interfere with your right to it.  The obligation test is widely used to determine what constitutes a right.  To illustrate: You have the right to own an axe, but you do not have a right to an axe.  If you do own an axe, others have an obligation not to steal it.

I've got a post-graduate education, and I had to read practically every sentence of this paragraph more than once to parse it. And it has a lot of problems beyond that:

 Normally we avoid second person. I don't see why it is needed here.
 """"widely challenged"""" with no citation: I have almost never seen this challenged except by liberatarians. I'm pretty confident that most people, for example, consider that the right to life extends to the point of creating an obligation for a government or society to attempt to rescue victims of a natural disaster. I would doubt that there is a """"widely"""" held belief that a person dying of thirst while someone next to him had abundant water could be reasonably expected to die respecting his neighbor's property rights.
 By the second sentence, this has switched to imperative (or, more precisely, hortatory) mode, which is entirely inappropriate. It becomes a statement of a narrowly libertarian conception of rights, in the article's narrative voice.
 Again """"widely used"""" without citation. I cannot name a country where this, in general, has the force of law. Certainly not the U.S., one of the more libertarian countries in the industrialized world, but one which recognizes a right to a publicly financed primary and secondary education.

In short: poorly written libertarian cant. 

I'll allow at least 48 hours (and probably more) for someone to rewrite this in a way that belongs here, but if it hasn't been substantially fixed by then, I intend simply to remove it. -  | Talk """,0

"""

Let's put it this way Flo, everyone has talked past me here for months. It is absolutely frustrating to have everything I contribute get labeled as """"disruptive."""" Disruptive, how? Tedentious, how? I sure as heck don't feel that I have done so because as far as I'm concerned I've acted in good faith trying to make Wikipedia the best it can be.

If you want to explain the rules to me and how I can be who I am on Wikipedia and stay within the rules, I'm all ears. I just want FM to leave me alone. How would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?

If you have done such a good job explaining everything to me, then why do I feel that I've been ganged up on without just cause? I know a lot of people who feel that Wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that's not very positive.

Why not listen to me? What do you all have to lose? My faith is the core of my being, and it's who I am. Do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to Wikipedia? Have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?

Do you care how ordinary readers view Wikipedia? You probably do, or else you wouldn't be here. The fact is traditionally minded Christians number over 1 billion people on this planet, and close to 100 million in the United States alone. That's not some tiny crackpot minority out there. If I feel attacked by Wikipedia, or feel that my POV is misrepresented, how do you think they feel reading Wikipedia?

Let's face it here, factually, the perspective represented in the articles in the Dominionism series, from my perspective, seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the United States regarding the Christian Right. 

Why should my work be reversed when I elaborate on the Dominionist's POV, which BTW, I don't agree with, for the sake of ensuring fairness. Or when FM, removes something I wrote from a reputable Evangelical ministry critical of Christian Reconstructionist theology? He tells me it's false or that I'm POV pushing. HOW? I cited the sources, which are widely respected in Evangelical circles.

What am I supposed to think when 2/3s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the Christian Right, who by the way are a minority of the total American population. Bush won twice because of their support and elected the GOP to Congress and a majority of the statehouses. 

Katherine Yurica's and TheocracyWatch's POV represents a MINORITY of the population. I have no idea where you live. Perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends, but they don't represent the larger picture. How is writing from the majority perspective POV pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective, considering it's the perspective of just a little over 50 percent of the American population.

I suggested banning partisanship as part of the NPOV rule and Consensus rule, but FeloniousMonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. When he does that, what am I supposed to think about his motives? I don't know him, and he hasn't exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. 

Have you ever stopped to think, it's not what you say, but how you say it? The tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive, and what am I supposed to think, other than what I've said ad nauseam? I feel attacked, not consulted with.

So far, I feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. Things like WP:POV, WP:POINT etc., that get put up when I feel that I have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.

Could you consider rephrasing it this way, or this is how you should be doing this. That's constructive in my view. 

Instead of hurling rules at me, the interpretations of which I disagree with, tell me why you think I stepped over the line and your rationale. I react positively to reasoned explanations, not summary reversals of my work, accusations of POV pushing, etc., without explanation.

Maybe you've been at this for awhile, so you take things for granted. I simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. Interpretation my friend. I want to understand your interpretation, and why you interpret the rules the way you do.

Every time I do anything, from asking people what they think about the rules, or my ideas for improving Wikipedia, I get written up on this RfC. Flo, please don't take this personally,  
90 percent of the time, I simply forget to login, not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging",0

Hey, thanks for your support.  I would like to inform you of my action plan/goals:
1) By end of tomorrow, I am going to get the Hinduism article to 60kb. For doing this, I am using the revert closest to the original FA article as a template along with the other religion pages.  It is proving to be easier than I originally thought as closer look shows a lot of repeats.
2) Then over the next few days, I plan on going thorugh every """"dodgy"""" reference and make sure it is upto the wikipedia standard.  If not, I will remove it and replace it with a valid reference.  Luckily, I have great access to lot of related scholarly articles + lot of time.  Also, I am hoping others to pitch in ofcourse.
3) I also have a long term goal based on your suggestion to round up some permanent editors for the article.  Their jobs will be to make sure stuff does not creep in + a long term goal of further improving the references.
Wish me luck ) bye. """,0

I think, also, Euro coins are mostly minted by the Royal Mint, well they do about 1/3 of the world's coinage and certainly had the die-stamps in place to do it before it was introduced (I'd have a hard time I guess tracking that citation down), and since you only need a different die-stamp for one side, makes sense to make them all in one place.

One thing I'm interested in, as a minor hobby, is the butterfly effect on Euros (not sure if that is quite the right phrase).

He also frequently plays the themes of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Merchant Marines.  

 If I was describing mere bumper music, I'd say it wasn't significant enough to merit a response.  But since there are several specific songs which are played regularly, often in their entirety, and contain common themes (pro-military, patriotic music), it's worth of inclusion.

That's it.  In the John H. Sununu article it states his father's profession and where he was from. Also more than this article. In Alexander Haig, a 4 star general and far more notable than Emanuel, there is nothing on his father. In H. R. Haldeman, it says that his father donated money to the Republican party. If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]]. Secondly, its not a POV. In summation, the general scheme of COS's is not to include background information on the person's father, which makes the desperation of some editors to include POV edits in this article all the more perplexing. crewer (yada, yada)

 You bet! I indeed am frustrated disappointed or should I disheartened and disgusted. Not because of the block though. It's because of the spiteful, hateful and downright vindictive behaviour some people have in wikipedia and with profound connivance of some administrators even. Mihaiam is a sock of Edward321 just look at their contributions for past 24 hours. Why should I be involved be anymore editing (although I really want to) when I know that some daft hater may simply revert ALL of them without caring much about silly things like justification or consequence and I will be blocked as a result? I shouldn't be involved. Wikipedia, like any other bureaucracy, is ruled by bullies (including some administrators). However, the real bureaucracies do give you a chance to settle the dispute in court or police station. And at least you can afford to not be so helpless about it. Here my edits were labelled as propaganda (implying that I'm a propagandist) after all my edits were rashly reverted (although they had the chance to simply modify inaccuracies with good sources, they chose to delete the whole section), nothing was done and because nothing was done, the reversion of my edits only accelerated (now, if not all, most of my edits are entirely reverted).  Then that genius John wrote on my talk-page  I'm edit-warring? I usually specifically mention (no edit-war intended) after my edit, in description. My friggin edits are getting reverted and I'm the one he deemed to be the edit-warrior? Come on now, will you. You don't want to help me. Frankly, I don't know what you want. Have a beautiful time here at the wikipedia. Humanity is withering away much faster here at the wikipedia than in the real world. The real world is sick in my view. But, in comparison to the demented arrangement here at wikipediaBecause here it every time sometimes  gratuitously comes down to majority of consensus, no matter how ignorant and/or prejudiced and/or oblivious the involved editors are about the topic at hand, their views still count. That's not a very efficient way, that is rather a crazy medieval way of discerning what's reliable and what's not. And thus, implies that minority is always wrong and majority is always correct. That's fundamentally incorrect., real world seems like a much better place to dwellAlthough I concede that some (few) of my sources too were questionable and faced justified skepticism, I don't think that it necessitated a whole reversion. Slight modifications would have worked just fine.. Thank God science doesn't progress like that in real world.  (Talk?)

 Third Reich related advice 

PA - I just wanted to make a suggestion to you for dealing with the Third Reich articles you've shown an interest in.  I happen to think there's some value (per NPOV) in what you're trying to add, but these articles need better sourcing and more tact than other articles, and you have been using such to date.  Remember, there are still a lot of people in the world with hair-triggers on the subject of Naziism, and any unreasonableness tends to magnify exponentially.

 Minotaurgirl 

Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song """"Behind These Hazel Eyes"""". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called """"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes"""", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like """"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved"""". I like the """"problem solved"""" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?

I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote """"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?"""" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.

If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars.

Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvements,Middayexpress. I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need. 

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

"Need for sympathy towards the too many anti-Christian violence articles 
There is a question of garnering donations from America and Europe with sob stories of anti-Christian violence, involved in the large number of articles being posted on anti-Christian violence in India, with seperate articles for each and every incident for whatever reason on anyone bearing a seemingly Christian name.

Your uncivil tone notwithstanding, I love being proved wrong, so please take this to Wikipedia:Deletion review.  IF you have a problem with my resolution, please submit to the appropriate forum on Wikipedia:Administrators noticeboard.

Regarding my decision: the concepts you were trying to present exist in the book's article; greater expounding does not, in my good faith search, exist in any documented form that conforms to our expectations, such as found at WP:V and WP:RS.  Again, if you disagree, I encourage you to use the forums/ outlets available to you.  My closure was a non-admin closure. -  talk 

Bollocks. That was an administrative action. That this is verifiable is admitted by you redirecting it to an article about a book covering it.- () Wolfkeeper (Talk) 

Deletion is administrative. Redirection is not inherently so and is most often executed by non-administrators.  That book, poorly referenced itself as being notable enough for inclusion, is barely enough to address such an obscure presentation.  100,000% greater clarity is required to make any sense of the topic as it is. -  talk

Wikipedia welcomes pictures even if they are not from the 'serious' sources. Pictures are the exclusion from the rule that one cannot add a personal content to Wikipedia.

If the content in Polish on the website www.garycki.com/index.html contradicts the above statement the website can be split between two independent domains (although still mutually linked, why not?) - one of which will be dedicated to the national parks.

Qumar:deletion
This… I don’t know where to start!
In no particular order:-
.a)I found this had been deleted when it turned up on my watchlist,, though I never saw the discussion there; presumably because it was on another page, and this deletion looks like an afterthought.
.b) “decision was to merge with The West Wing # Foreign …""""
Well, actually it wasn’t.
3 voted for merging Equatorial Kundu and Qumar in a new page Fictional Countries in the West Wing;
2 voted for merge and re-direct to WW#F (3 if you count yourself)
2 others had no preference.
In the event you didn’t even do that; a search for Qumar leads to the top of the WW page, making it necessary to scroll through to find it.
.c) I find it hard to believe this would be agreeable to anyone who is interested in, or has contributed to, the WW pages; does that describe anyone who spoke on this decision? 
.d)The reason for the proposal isn’t that clear; “not notable”? So where does that leave all the other pages about fictional characters, places, histories?
.e)“can be re-created if sources are found to establish out-of-universe notability”; what does that mean? If it’s referred to in a book, like a commentary on the West Wing (though you don’t know, and haven’t checked, if there is one)? (for the record, there are at least 5 in the British Library Catalogue, and at least one in our town library; shall I check? Would it make any difference?
.f)“theres nothing on the page that isn’t said elsewhere""""; Well, there was quite a big page before (from memory), now there’s just a paragraph, so something has gone. And if information is in several places, what does it matter? It makes sense to repeat things/items/details from various places onto a single page to make the information more accessible; even real encyclopaedias can do that, the more so a virtual one.
.g) ) The page wasn’t (again, from memory) badly written, or un-encyclopaedic, especially compared to some of the pages I’ve seen; is WP so big that we can afford to be tearing decent pages out? (it’s still not as big or as comprehensive as a decent-sized city library).

Boothy, as much difficulty as you and some of the other true believers seem to have with this concept, not everything is a matter of opinion, and not all opinions are equally valid. When I post to an article about the city of Chicago, I do so as somebody who actually does live here, has done so for a good long time, and knows the place firsthand - something that the idiots who did the reverts can't legitimately claim for themselves. You've offered a vague remark about how I have a problem with some of the editor's """"opinions""""; in true Usenet fashion, giving the spin while leaving out the awkward details.

The """"opinions"""" given are on such subjects as what the lowest reported temperature in Chicago was, whether or not cheese customarily appears on an Italian Beef sandwich, and other things which, like these, aren't a matter of guesswork, but of simple observation. One of the additions I made to the article which somebody, I believe yourself, wiped out with a revert mentioned the """"arctic express"""" winter of 1981-82. When one takes the already silly concept of NPOV, and exaggerates it to the point at which one wipes out mentions of actual historical events which one just doesn't happen to have been will informed enough about the subject to havew heard of, one has reached a level of lunacy unusual even by the standards of the Internet and postmodernism. I said this before and will stand by it - anybody who feels that the mention of an unusually cold winter is too much cointroversy for the site to handle obviously has issues that cry out for medication.

So let's not act like I was getting angry because one of the """"editors"""" (read: overly pushy posters) disagreed with me about what the best movie of May was, or anything of that sort, which is clearly the impression that you're trying to leave the reader with. My well-justified anger comes from the fact that somebody has used censorship in an attempt to conceal the fact that he didn't know what he was talking about when he wrote that article. I might say that same about the people who did the reverts, including, for example, somebody from """"Concordia"""", wherever that is - somewhere far enough from Chicago that most of us have never even heard of it. And yet this person feels qualified to vet additions to an article on Chicago.

That's messed up. - Joseph from Chicago""",0
"I am moving the list of european supporters to here otherwise her biography page gets clogged up with names of supporters. The only support which matters is next year at election 2012. The experts say that Manipuris are backward and need to be educated about democracy. The arab spring has taught the experts that it is the people who need to educate their political masters on what kind of democracy they want. I hope Manipuris at last take the opportunity to free Sharmila and rid Manipur of the black law next year.

On 28 November 2010, UK Green Party leader and European Parliament member Keith Taylor wrote to the Indian government seeking the release of Sharmila and the repeal of the AFSPA. Her main supporter in the European Union is Sir Graham Watson KB MEP  chair of the India/EU delegation of MEPs. He has consistently made interventions on her behalf most recently to Dr J Bhagwati Indian Ambassador to the EU who responded on 1 July 2011 to his request to respond to the death threats made against Irom Sharmila. Indian Ambassadors reference BRU/AMB/48/2011 Embassy of India, 1050 Brussels. He responds only that he understands that Irom Sharmila is a hunger striker and that the modification of AF(SP)A is under consideration. Previously in April 2011 Sri Graham Watson and the EU delegation had tried to visit Manipur but were not allowed to do so by the Indian Authorities. They visit each year this year they were allowed to visit, Delhi, Patna and Mumbai. Although Keith Taylor did write three letters on one occasion he has never responded to further input. Sri Graham Watson and other members of the EU delegation do always respond to further requests for help. For example a Dutch member of the India EU delegation Peter Van Dalen whose special interest group is Dalit and subaltern groups released this press statement for publication at the gathering at her tenth anniversary of fasting in November 2010  Smt Sharon Bowles MEP sent Sharmila a personal letter of support which is now with Sharmila. She had added her personal regret that Sharmila was not nominated for the Sakharov last year due to insufficient support from other MEPs a nomination requires at least 40 MEP signatories. This year's nominations close on 13 September 2010. Another MEP member of the EU/India Delegation has stated that he does not believe Sharmila will be nominated this year either as very few MEPs know of her or Manipur.

The European MEPs were initially brought in by one of her Western campaigners Nicholas Crawford a philosophy student at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. He also chairs a small student think tank. The Wilberforce Society. At the annual garden party Mr Crawford gave a speech about Irom Sharmila and the AFSPA in attendance was their patron Lord Wilson, a former head of the civil service, and Sir Christopher Hum, former UK ambassador to China. Before Xmas they hope to have a seminar on India and Human Rights. And plan to visit Manipur and Sharmila next summer. Sharmila has many letters from offices of Western Dignatories including those of HM Queen Elizabeth II, The Duchess of Cornwall, The President of Eire, Tony Blair and most recently the Scottish First Minister and the Mayor of London all stating that they are sorry about her circumstances but are unable to offer her any assistance. But she has always cared more about genuine letters seeking to make connections.",0

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

The last evolution of sas nigel's perseverance to create a guild. The guild's name is orginally derived from their first born baby, named Angelo Asher Ancheta. The baby is the source of all strength and power of the couple, and so naming for it in a guild is a good one..

Asher is composed of all star-break away guildmembers. One of it was deMonyiTa`~, [BS]Blackmith, milennia of Bad Boys, Rikku9, ...ommi..., † WardeN † of Majesty, and the rest of BANDITS members. 
This members have one thing in common, their school, except for ommi studying at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. deMonyiTa`~ is being recruited by p a o l o in an event, wherein he finds Autogame Cybershop """"home"""". Being fascinated with the idea of having one guild shop gives deMonyiTa`~ the wit to have an extension guild for asher.

ASHER: FIRST RPC
Asher, being a beginner guild for the RPC, tied up its allegiance with The Tyrants.. The Tyrants alliance is composed of Majesty, Dynasty, Ninja, WADAB, ASHER and MacWorld Clan.""",0

 Jacob Haun, not a Mormon? 

I am confused. According to this article, Haun was not a Mormon. But in """"The Work and the Glory,"""" a historical fiction series, it is explained in volume 4 that Haun was not only a Mormon but that he deliberately ignored counsel from Joseph Smith to vacate the settlement and lead the settlers to one of the Church's strongholds, such as Adam-Ondi-Ahman or Jackson County. For verification of these facts, see """"Church History in the Fulness of Times,"""" pg. 201. Pg. 183 of the same volume says Haun's Mill was a Mormon settlement established by Haun.

I intend to rewrite that section, is there a way I could get a list of links to articles you've written, either on fox or elsewhere? The fact that you have dropped some entries on Fox's blog should probably stay in there, but just as a note and the section as a whole, including the title, should probably focus on your career as a journalist. Second, I didn't quite understand """"The lede says I'm an """"embed on assignment in Iraq"""". I've spent just as much time in Iraq."""" Could you possibly explain what you meant there? I could just be dense, but it left me confused. And the Ann Coulter photo... Is it under a free license? If so I don't really see a need to remove it. Any chance you can show me the diff that pulled it out? Thanks. ask? 
What Matt seems to have said is that he's spent about equal amounts of time as a reporter in Afghanistan as in Iraq. 306 

 I have spent roughly an equal amount of time in Afghanistan and Iraq.  

The entries at the Fox Blog are meant to promote the articles.  We technically get paid for the articles over at Foxnews.com.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

About pronunciation and writing of Asiatic lion / Singh in Hindi

It is pronounced and written in Hindi as:  """"Sa"""" with a small """"Ee"""" ki Matra before it, with a point on top suggesting half """"Na"""" and then full """"Ha. 

As in English you cant write the exact word, after English came they wrote the word as """"Singh"""", but Gujaratis in Gujarat write and pronounce it completely different, its a different language. They write it and pronounce it close to """"Sinnh"""", their Sinh means Asiatic Lion too but is not spelled as or written the same as Hindi.

There is also a surname in Mair Rajputs which is Shinh, that is Asiatic Lion too, again it is different word but this is not a middle name, it is the actual surname / family name from Mair Rajputs.

"Dbinder, you asked if someone could verify those possible future regional members... well, if someone really could they wouldn't be possible future members but future members....

anyway:

as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.

Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.

At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. 

Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.

Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.

Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the Alliance

Since you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.

They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam",0

A History Lesson from, The Catholic Knight: 

""""British anti-Catholicism has a long history going back five centuries and reaching the highest levels of British government. It began in the early 16th century when King Henry VIII failed to receive an annulment from the Vatican and subsequently broke English Christianity away from the pope and declared himself the absolute spiritual ruler of the Church of England. He then proceeded on a campaign to persecute and murder all who opposed his personal claim to the """"English papacy."""" Things only went downhill from there. In subsequent generations the throne passed between Catholic and Protestant heirs, each persecuting their political enemies. The final result came under Queen Elizabeth I which settled England as a Protestant country. In the following centuries, England became the leading herald of anti-Catholic propaganda around the world, as the British crown persecuted Irish Catholics and waged war against the Catholic kingdoms of France and Spain.""""

""""Sadly, the more things change the more they stay the same. The world may have moved into the 21st century, but British politics is still locked in the 16th century. To date Catholics are still forbidden from the British royal family. Government officials still mock the pope and the Church behind closed doors. Leading party officials not only refuse to defend the pope's right of innocence until proven guilty, but actually participate in promoting anti-Catholic presumption. Way to go England! Thanks for reminding the world just how little you've progressed in five centuries. Just brilliant! Jolly good show!"""" Malke2010 """,0

Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record.

So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different """"sides"""" being numbered differently. 

I also don't agree that the sides should be eliminated completely; an album article is supposed to reflect the reality of the initial release, which, for most of the best music ever recorded, is vinyl. It is our responsibility to convey that reality accurately, not to revise it.  •talk•   """,0

Hi. Can you please point me to the WP:MOS page that says all individual bridges, tunnels, locks, etc must be described in lower case?

It is correct to talk about """"the locks at Foxton"""", and """"the canal in Basingstoke"""", but using mixed capitalisation is misleading: Foxton locks suggests a type of lock known as 'Foxton'.  You could not correctly say a Bath deep lock, unless there was more than one of them: one would write 'the Bath Deep Lock.

"Amirite Article 

Hi Greg Jack,

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases. This one for example is certainly not a paid release: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-opinions-online-amiritenet-amirite/ Makeuseof is a very well known site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeUseOf

I don't think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesn't mention adversarial on it. Also Amirite's twitter has over 62,000 followers which is significant: https://twitter.com/amiritecom And if you type Amirite.com and Amirite.net into google this brings more than 5 million results.

"I always thought that the shunt diodes were needed. The conceptual model that one diode is on during each half cycle, shorting out the corresponding cap isn't quite right.  What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.",0

 Documented fraud and corruption at Wikipedia etc... 

September 4, 2008
 

Wikimedia Foundation Inc.
P.O. Box 78350
San Francisco, CA 94107-8350
Organized under the laws of the State of Florida
 
 
 
Re: Documented fraud and corruption at Wikipedia etc.., and much more...
 

Attn: Mr. Jimmy Wales, Mr. Michael Snow and Mr. Godwin and all concerned parties.
 

Dear Wikipedia, Wikinews and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., etc...   The following serious issues can be addressed and handled, either by a respected mutual resolution or through legal action.  
 
1) Via documented corruption and fraud, certain Wikipedia editors and administrators, notably Blackpearl14 and Lessheard vanU have openly accused, I,  Royce Mathew of “harassment”, “attacking”  “stalking” and such.   Utilizing their unique power, tools and resources provided by Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., they blatantly sought out and continue to seek out to threaten, hurt and damage contributing writers.   These are serious allegations.  However their corruption is not limited to themselves.   Other editors and administrators are part of their network, who works with them in their purposely threatening and deliberate destructive operation.  Wikipedia’s computer history has documented their actions.  Photos are available.  However, I firmly advise Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., to also preserve all of the evidence in light of possible litigation.
 
2) On or about September 2, 2008, Blackpearl14 ,who had already gone through various identity changes as allowed by Wikipedia, who is afforded certain power, tools and resources by Wikinews,  Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation, has deliberately and deceitfully edited my complaint letter posted on the Wikipedia’s administrators “talk” complaint board.  She even cut out an entire paragraph from it.  This was done without my knowledge, nor with my permission and is completely unacceptable.  As electronic history recorded it, this was done to remove reported transcript evidence of her own self confessed bias, her own personal agenda, her own particular goals and her own self business associated with Wikipedia directly exploiting Wikipedia, it’s articles and the power provided to her.   She also had made changes to her own personal bio pages after I sent her a copy of the letter, acting as if the transcript sources didn’t exist.  After doing these corrupt acts, Blackpearl14 continued right on with her serious allegations against me.   She had responded directly below the adulterated letter.   Thus with her fraudulent and evident criminal acts, Blackpearl14  had corruptly altered and modified a letter to be deliberately representative of me, falsely presented it as being from me, and then herself and some of her fellow editors and administrators answered the letter as though they had only just read it.   Using the tools, resources, and privileged authority, Blackpearl14 continues to succeed in leveling serious charges against me, even falsely accusing me of modifying her bio, adulterating my talk correspondence which sought intervention, and meanwhile her peers of editors and administrators, had aided her acts.  To prevent any “undo” of Blackpearl14 deliberate adulteration of my letter, I was also blocked and any attempt to post a copy of the letter to yet again notify the administration of the serious issues at hand, were immediately deleted by Slakr.  They are a wild gang with free total control, provided by Wikinews,  Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation, with which to recklessly cause harm and destruction, and wrongfully threaten and silence their victims.   Wikipedia’s computer history has documented hers, her peers, editors and administrators continual acts.   Photos are available.  However, I firmly advise Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc.,  to also preserve all of the evidence in light of possible litigation.
 
3) As documented, Blackpearl14's own statements and declarations are from the same person who with her fellow editors and administrators continue to uphold double standards, and level serious charges against me, including that I and other writers were bias about Pirates of the Caribbean and the Walt Disney Company and that I and other writers weren’t being neutral about Pirates of the Caribbean, and then used their powers, tools and resources afford to them by Wikipedia, Wikinews and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., with which to engage in various reckless and corrupt acts against me.  For quick review, here is a collection of some of BLACKPEARL14 (uses various alias wikipedia names) self published bia quotes from 2007-through August 2008, on her own pages, as history recorded it, done by her, which she has clearly stated her bias purpose, her own bias causes and her own bias business.   “I am Pirate Lord-ess of the Caribbean Sea",0

"US States name game is a terrible example 

Due to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:
Over 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.
Almost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.
The only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.
There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)
Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",0

"""{{unblock|THANK YOU for a reasonable fucking comment!!! The ONLY USER in ANY AREA who has actually made one!!  (Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

Edits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional): """"Users working with me should not...revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead"""" - Instead of reverting multiple times, attacking, and then harassing, the use",0

"Referring to her as *Catherine* 

I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke.  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!  Mary Boleyn is called *Mary*, not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford*, Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk*, etc, & they're not royals.

She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft.

 Pseudonymous editing 

copied from an email received offline
Hi,

I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, """"you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""""

Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.

And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.

Thanks,
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz
bathory@bathory.org
bathory@maltedmedia.com

Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  

That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.

By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.

Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.

Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.

Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?

To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.

An event horizon is any surface from beyond which no information can ever reach the observer.  Of course, that includes objects of all kinds - in fact, anything moving at or below the speed of light - so in a sense you're right.  An important thing to note though is that the event horizon - in the strictest sense - belongs to the observer, rather than the thing (not) being observed.  In the case of a black hole, the event horizon is the same for all outside observers, which I guess is what you mean by a 'physical boundary'.  The Event horizon article is biased towards this, the most commonly encountered form of event horizon.  The cosmological event horizon is different: since every point in the Universe is receding from every other point with a speed proportional to distance, the event horizon is always a sphere centred on a particular observer, so there is no single 'event horizon of the Universe' (although of course we tend to give a special place to our own event horizon).

So neither article is wrong, although the introduction to Event horizon gives a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the term, which I'll try to fix.  The cosmological use is however mentioned in Event horizon#Event horizon of the observable universe.  There are more details in Cosmological horizon and Particle horizon.

Another response from Jmk

Thank you for finally looking into this.  Do you think I would be so adamant if I had something to hide vis a vis the clone/impersonation issue?  I will be very curious to see what your findings show, as I have my suspicions, but I will keep them to myself for now.  As I have repeatedly stated, the *only* anonymous edits I made were after my editing privileges were blocked, and then only to correct misinformation in the Farmer article, all of which has since been re-inserted by Wyss herself.  You're right, all I wanted was accuracya simple review of my very first post to Wyss' talk page will show (despite my improper posting etiquette, for which I have repeatedly apologized) that all I asked her to do was fact-check.

I am well aware of the Rashomon like qualities of attempting to discern the truth about Frances Farmer.  That indeed is why the subtitle to my article """"Shedding Light on Shadowland"""" is indeed called The Truth About Frances Farmer.  That in turn is why my research has been used by A&E; Biography, NPR, the Washington Post, and, hilariously, the magazine Wyss apparently thinks discredits me, 'American Atheist.'  If you read Conrad Goeringer's article in 'American Atheist' you will find that I am his major source of information and, indeed, there is a whole secondary article about me and my findings vis a vis the false lobotomy allegations.

What bothers me about all of this is not the block (though Wyss says it's easy to get rescinded, I have yet to receive even a hint of how to do that, but that truly is not important to me), but Wyss' repeated assertions that I have sinister motives and, more importantly, have cloned her ID and/or impersonated her.  In terms of my motives, I have for over 20 years worked diligently to rid the world of misinformation about Frances Farmer, and I have been lauded internationally in the press and broadcast media for my attempts.  How is that sinsister?  In terms of the cloning/impersonation, what more can I say?  I have asked repeatedly for someone to do something technical to prove I didn't do it.

It seems that Wyss has had frequent run-ins with others, and perhaps I am the unwitting recipient of some pent-up frustration on her part.  As I have come to surmise, I am probably at least twice as old as most of you, and I am willing to cut you """"kids"""" (joke) some slack, but I want these false allegations to stop and I am asking again for someone to do an IP trace and consclusively state publicly to Wyss and everyone involved that I had nothing to do with this clone ID/impersonation affair.""",0
""":Dear Federico, when I have the time, and I promise I'll make the time, I'll delete any true ad hominem remarks (""""dense"""" would be a good example). Not only do they not belong on wikipedia, but as a student of logic, it is a classic logical fallacy to use an ad hominem remark to form an argument. But as I said, I feel passionately about the subject, and it has brought out the worst in me.

However, certain comments I will not remove. A claim of hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark, it's a statement that one's views are contradictory, that proposes one standard for one case, and another standard for another. As such hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark, rather it is used to describe inconsistent statements or behaviour.

For example, you mention that """"You have to show me where the statistics of historians’ opinions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki decision is. Does it include Soviet historians, Japanese historians, Chinese historians, South American historians, East and West European historians, Africans historians, Arab, Indian historians? Or only include U.S. Army historians? Even in that case, opinion of the majority is still OPINION, not fact."""" Fair enough, but later on you say """"it's been stated many times that the Americans were only thinking of saving American lives through the A-Bomb. The Japanese never came into it. They did not care at all about Japanese lives, so your reasoning is invalid."""" Who said this? You impose such high criteria for my statement that the A-Bomb saved human lives, requiring experts from all over the world, but soon after you baldly assert that my reasoning is invalid because """"it's been stated many times..."""" Stated many times by who? According to your very own criteria, you need to provide evidence from Soviet historians, Japanese historians, Chinese historians, South American historians, East and West European historians, Africans historians, Arab and Indian historians. But you don't. You merely state """"it's been stated many times...therefore my reasoning is invalid."""" Apparently Loomis has to provide sources, but we can take Federico's word for it whatever he says. That, my dear friend, is hypocrisy. And you, my dear friend, are a hypocrite for reasoning in such a way. Calling you a hypocrite is therefore not an ad hominem remark and I therefore will not remove it.

And by the way, thank you for pointing out my typo when I put a K in the word """"recognize"""". Again, it seems that when Loomis makes the slightest spelling typo, its fair game to point it out, but when Federico makes numerous spelling, grammar, syntactical etc... mistakes, its impolite to recognize and show sensitivity towards the fact that English is not Federico's first language.

I have more to say but unfortunately I have an appointment. Hopefully I'll get back in time to finish this before you read it. In the mean time, I truly mean it when I say that I consider myself a soft-spoken, agreeable person. Isn't all this mea culpa proof on anything? Speak to you later and all the best.

Hello NickCT  Could you please describe where synthesis is occurring  that is, can you show where the article is """"combining material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources""""? Could you please describe what you think is a violation of WP:POV? WP:COATRACK is an essay, not a policy, so COATRACK issues are a matter of personal opinion, not of policy.
A few points regarding deletion:
 There are several books, journal articles, chapters of bioethics textbooks, etc. that have been written specifically on the topic of this article (unethical, nonconsensual, and/or illegal medical experiments in the U.S.). They clearly separate this topic from that of human subject research in the United States in general.
 There exist articles for several other nations that are similar to this one, such as Nazi human experimentation, North Korean human experimentation, Japanese human experimentation. They exist for the same reason that this one should exist  numerous high-quality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves.
 A wide array of reliable sources have identified this article's topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis, separate from the broader history of human subject research in general. Per WP:NOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article. Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider """"bad"""" (which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of """"bad science"""") does not mean that it is """"biased"""" to have an article on them. WP:NPOV does not say that articles can't be about """"bad things"""". It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things, regardless of our moral/ethical views on them. This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts, and histories of this topic have to say about it. I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying. 
That said, like all articles, this article is an incomplete work in progress, so there are certainly issues. Rather than merely citing policy without reference to this article, please make specific suggestions for how to improve this article.  """,0

"I am really writing this post to counter the claims that Marxism has direct responsibility for human rights violations, or the regimes it has inspired, (although admittedly at the end of the day Marxism may hold some indirect reponsibility). I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalists, it was backwards, and most of its populace was uneducated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral/ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communists the reasons were nationalistic or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right. What I am saying is that if Marx dictated that communist states should function as they have and do today, yes maybe human rights violations would deserve a mention, but his ideology is not to blame, it is the [people who follow his ideology who often commit the crimes.86.150.147.133   User: R.G.P.A",0

The main reason I was editing this page is because contributions by user """"Laveol"""" are offensive to the Macedonians. Lazar Kolisevski was a Macedonian, from Republic of Macedonia.
But still he does not deserver to have false information published under his English Wikipedia Page. I have to add that Macedonian Wikipedia Page about Lazar Kolisevski is what the English Page should be edited.
In general there are a lot of negation politics from the Macedonia's neighboring countries. Any of them would negate something about Macedonia: country, nation, language, culture, history, name and so on.
The information from Laveol is in line with this negation policies of those countries, in this case from Bulgaria. Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda is mainly based on negating the Macedonians as a separate nation, Macedonian as a separate language, same about the history.

Given the (non)popularity of Lazar Kolisevski in the modern times Laveol was able to edit the page and have that false information be viewable to Wikipedia users.
This was over that top and I decided to take action about it - Delete the false information, which is not only false, but is offensive to Macedonians and Macedonian People.

When you are Macedonian, your parents are Macedonian. Not Bulgarian or any other nationality.
When you talk about this sensitive topics, you cannot use books published in Bulgaria, as most of them are Propagandistic, working on the principles on 19th century Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and Expansionism.

So the reason why that information by Laveol is deleted by me is that it is false and offensive to Macedonians.

"As your own comment indicates ('few Jewish scholars have explored, or developed a theology of, the New Covenant'), the 'New Covenant' is simply not an issue in Jewish messianism as such.  When that bit of Jeremiah is discussed in Jewish dialogue, it is never (as far as I know) with the nomenclature 'New Covenant'.  Even if it is true that that is the appropriate term and that it is an important issue in Jewish messianism, in the absence of serious citation otherwise, it would seem to me to be original research.  Neither the term nor the link to the article, therefore, have a place in an article on Jewish messanism, except as a compare and contrast with the Christian notion(s).

 POV statement which couldn't be salvaged 

I removed the following statement from the article, hoping that someone will rewrite this.
""""Former CIA agent John Stockwell, who was stationed in Angola while working with the CIA, argued that the CIA murdered 10,000 Angolans by arbitrarily warmongering.http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htmhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8""""

Reasons I think it's POV:
""""arbitrarily"""" - Please elaborate, and explain how this is relevant to the article
""""warmongering"""" - I think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia, and certainly not here.  There are many other better words.
The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself.  So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country?
The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection.  Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate?
The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history.  In another article about, I don't know, CIA activities in Angola, maybe, but not here.

""":Except for the fact that Iraq did not have weaponized anthrax. Remember the WMD debacle? Weaponized anthrax is considered by all to be a WMD. Iraq's process, from research only, was also substantially different. So, either the administration DID find WMD's in Iraq and chose to instead embarrass the nation by denying them AND cover up an Iraqi WMD attack upon the US, which would be a clear cut act of war or the conspiracy theory is wrong. The """"makes sense"""" part then yields to Occam's razor, the conspiracy theory would have to be that the US choose to loose standing and face international criticism over invading Iraq and finding no WMD's AND pass up the opportunity to declare war on Iraq for a WMD attack OR the anthrax was NOT weaponized by Iraq, as it was coated and prepared differently than the Iraqi anthrax weaponization program did, but prepared in a way researched and used in past US programs. In short, the conspiracy theory fails on any examination of the facts as known.

We go nowhere like that
Comment. I don't feel ready to back the one or the other position here. For the time being I feel a bit closer to Dhan's position but from a different point of view. I just want to point out two things:
According to a Greek historian, Paparregopoulos, some hellenized Phanariotes families, like Ghikas' family, had lost their Greek identity in the 19th century. This fact seems to justify the use of """"predominantly"""", since in indicates one thing: In the 19th century not 100% of the Phanariotes families had a Greek indentity. Maybe they were 99% but even this 1% justifies the use of """"predominantly"""". I can live without this word (I can also live with the word!), but, if Dhan wants to add it, I cannot prevent him (at least, according to my logic).
If we accept that 99% and not 100% of the Phanariotes were Greeks, this does not affect at all the traits of the Greek War of Independence, as Miskin has said. Ok! Not 100% but maybe 99% of Phanariotes played a role in this war? What does it change? Nothing! A big fuss for nothing! 
I'd like Dahn to further substantiate and back with additional sources his arguments. What about some Googlebooking?! Everybody could do that, in order to reinforce one's arguments.
In any case, I don't think that we can solve this dispute on ourselves. The problem is much deeper. There are two extreme positions and no intention for a compromise. Therefore, I think about inviting an objective third party in this discussion: I speak about  """,0

I also get the impression that you don't see that as a bad thing, but frustrating people into submission or Godwin's law isn't the way to win an individual argument or your NFC crusade. You're nominating images for deletion left, right and centre based on technicalities in the NFCC policy and NFC guideline without regard for their encyclopaedic benefit or the spirit of those rules and you're weathering editors down to the extent that you're driving them away from uploading images or even from contributing by tagging their images at a near-robotic speed and frequency. That's not what the rules are for, that's not what Twinkle is for (as your previous trips to ANI should have made you aware) and if that's what was in the best interests of the project, we'd have a bot doing it. You've been offered a perfectly dignified solution that would allow you to continue the good that you do while mitigating the negative effects in the form of a voluntary undertaking not to nominate more than two images per uploader per day.

OurMed
Hi! My name is Marilena Tsangaroulis and I'm on the Volunteer Committee of an online healthcare movement called """"OurMed"""".

At OurMed, we're committed to creating an interactive health site that uses a global, collaborative tool like with Wikipedia but goes an important step furtherwe verify all content by healthcare professionals like yourself.

We launched the Wikipedia version last year (OurMed's Site) , and this year we’re adding a host of important features that will make Ourmed an extensive site for unbiased and user driven clinical research/tools for physicians as well as user friendly resources for patients and consumers. You can have a peek at our new design here: (Our New Site in Development)

Although we have a section on editorials in the new site, the new one will emphasize non-commercial, unbiased informationall entirely free. The organization is governed by a non-profit Board made up of Healthcare professionals, the former head of Wikipedia, Florence Devouard, former accountant of Wikipedia Oleta McHenry and other professionals.

Here's a short video of our plans: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAqbMl1dVk

 Let me also add that I understand how frustrating it is to be up against a banned editor, who has no qualms about gaming the system to get what they want. I have no time for that editor, and will gladly help to WP:RBI whenever I spot his edits. But its important to separate the issue from the person. The fact is, it is not only that banned editor who supports the piped solution. Therefore you going around changing it on an article-by-article basis is no different from what he did - you are forcing your interpretation on the article. This issue is going to rumble on, and editors who are willing to edit war to push their own interpretations will end up restricted. Trust me, I've been around for long enough, and have seen it time and again. And the patience of the admin community is tiring on this subject.

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.

Hi, MurderWatcher1. This is Paul1513 again. This is to let you know that I have completed the SLR Chronology bibliography for you and that I am going to try to upload  a PDF copy to your Talk page as soon as I finish this note. This may take a while, because I've never uploaded a PDF before.

You're absolutely right; it would be great if some of the old Modern Photography stuff could be added to Wikipedia. However, you can be sure that they're still under copyright. (Pre-1978 American """"work-for-hire"""" copyrights are generally 75 years; 1978 and on, 95 years.) The real question is: Who OWNS the copyright today? Since Modern went under, there have been many media company sales and resales - the present copyright holder would be hell to uncover and ask permission. In fact, the current owner might not even know that it owns Modern's copyrights. """"Orphaned"""" copyrights are a major unresolved """"fair use"""" issue in the information age.

Speaking of first cameras: mine was a simple Vivitar 110 point-and-shoot. My parents gave it to me for getting straight A's  in the 5th grade. It was, of course, a bad camera, but it opened up a world of possibilities. From the Vivitar, I eventually learned about the existence of the Pentax Auto 110 SLR. It was then one step to 35 mm SLRs and I got a Nikon FE2 in 1983. The FE2 is also the reason why the bulk of my Modern Photography magazine citations begin around 1983.

I'm sorry to hear about your disputes with the Admins over your non-photography Wkipedia entries. It would be unfortunate if you felt compelled to end your Wikipedia activities over them. Perhaps you could start a blog or create a MySpace or Facebook page to air these issues without worrying about what the Admins want.

 Jesus article too long 

Recently, I was trying to add quotes of Jesus to the article but I got a revert with this response:  """"this article is long enough - refer reader to wikisource or other articles"""" Doc glasgow

The problem with this is that many if not all wiki articles on people have quotes of them, and many of them have """"quotes"""" sections.

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a """"Other topics about Jesus"""" towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.

I propose that we condense these topics:

1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section)
2. Background
3. Names and titles
4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics
5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals

And then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.

Also, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.

This should substantially reduce these sections:
1. Notes
2. Sources and further reading
3. See also
4. External links

After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.  Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice, and maybe Jesus can become a featured article.

 Wahabi and terrorism 

I have added this heading with neutral and verifiable sources which is most missing point from this Article.

Wahabi relationship with Terrorism
Wahabism,Saudi Arabia’s dominant faith is an austere form of Sunni Islam and Its explosive growth began in the 1970s when Saudi charities started funding Wahabi schools and mosques.[22] Professor Bernard Lewis, a leading scholar of Islam, has noted that the Wahhabis are to Islam what the Ku Klux Klan is to Christianity. They can be accused of hijacking Islam.[23]
The Wahabi movement is directly involved in terrorist activities all over the World.The Al Qaeda and a lot of recent Islamic terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, have been inspired by Wahabism[24]. The regular Bombing of shrines in Pakistan and Killing of Sunnis and Shias is done by Sipah-e-Sahaba and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan).[25] Wahabism is associated with the removal of head stones from the graves of the members of the family of the Prophet Muhammed, and the desecration of Islamic shrines in Hejaz and Karbala in Iraq, and the struggle for power in what was yet to become Saudi Arabia. Once its followers took power, they did whatever they could to destroy Ethiopia. For example, the secessionist war in Eritrea (1958-1991), which was designed to make Ethiopia land-locked, was largely financed by Saudi Arabia. Likewise, Saudi finance made it possible for Somalia to invade Ethiopia in 1977- 1978. The Saudi authorities may deny this, but it is widely documented. [26]
[edit]In Pakistan

The JamatudDawah ,Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,Lashkar-e-Taiba and Sipah Sahaba are main terrorist organization of Wahabi movements .These terrorist organizations have been banned by Pakistani government but are working by their new names.

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections.

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

Biased section on Turkey

""""Turkey On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none. 

And there is such a biased section on Turkey. the editor andranik, an armenian by origin, who carries the name of the armenian terrorist and nationlist milita head accuses",0

"""I believe the translation of the sentence """"Gott ließ uns fallen, und so stürzen wir denn auf ihn zu."""" is possibly inaccurate because perhaps the author translated the separable verb  """"zustürzen"""" as the simple verb stürzen.

In my German-English dictionary:

Stürzen = """"to fall"""" or """"to crash""""

Zustürzen = """"rush up to""""

But if Dürrenmatt was writing in a Swiss-German dialect (which I know almost nothing about other than that German-speakers sometimes have difficulty understanding Swiss German-speakers), these words could have different meanings, and I could be completely wrong.

I think a better translation would be:

"To start: this cannot be discussed with you. You are topic banned from agricultural chemicals broadly construed. As per the article content, DOW are quite clearly a company who specialise in agricultural chemicals, and RE Bhopal - this was a chemical disaster that involved a chemical mainly used in fertiliser. You are not allowed to edit in this topic area.

However for anyone else: coatracking environmental concerns with one company into another companies article is non-neutral editing. Dow and Dupont are not merged yet. Info on past DuPont environmental concerns may be relevant on a combined Dow-Dupont article once the companies merge - I assume at that point someone will either create a new article on the new company, or attempt to merge the Dow-Dupont articles together. From experience and past convention it is likely this would end up as a third article with the Dow & Dupont articles covering the individual histories of the respective companies. Assuming this article is kept as a historical article of Dow prior to the merge, it wouldnt be valid here, would be at DuPont, and would be at an article after the merger.

RE Bhopal: The only reason Dow is even relevant is that activists are claiming Dow is responsible for the cleanup once it acquired Carbide many years later. Which is more than covered by the information included currently. Detailed info on the Bhopal disaster is available at the dedicated article and the article for Carbide (who were responsible for the problem).

The tensor density is not """"artificially introduced"""". The numerical values of the four components of Ad are exactly the same as those which appear three times each among the components of Aa b c along with three each which are their negatives and forty zeros. So this is merely selecting a subset of components which represent the independent information in the original A.
If someone naively attempted to use Maxwell's equations in a curvilinear coordinate system or in the presence of significant amounts of gravity, then he would find that they still work in that context (except for the constitutive equations which relate D to E and H to B). How can this be explained in your ideology? It only makes sense when one realizes that some of the quantities are tensor densities.
So please see that I am not adding tensor densities to make life harder. Rather I am finding that they already exist and permitting their use to avoid the extra and unnecessary work of converting everything to ordinary tensors. Why multiply by the metric when you do not have to? Why use the Levi-Civita connection when partial derivatives will suffice?   """,0

wikipedia entry on ten-string guitar can no longer be considered reliable 

It has been a battle to keep the wikipedia entry on """"ten-string guitar"""" from being turned into the usual farce that one expects of the """"information"""" presented in both wikipedia and most sites that purport to be about the 10-string guitar (both being 'littered with inaccuracies' and even deliberate misinformation). 

For the time being, I must devote my energies to the final stages of my Doctoral studies and let the fools play at being pseudo-musicologists on wikipedia. It is, however, a disgrace that the first two pages through which most online readers are introduced to """"the ten-string guitar"""" (that is wikipedia and Janet Marlow's tenstringguitar(dot)com) are riddled with inaccuracies, untenable claims, and (as shown in a previous blog) even deliberate distortion of Narciso Yepes's words in an attempt to misrepresent the historical and scientific facts of the matter.

Since I've spoken out about this disinformation, I note that my main page here has suspiciously been deleted from most google search listings containing the terms """"10-string guitar"""" or """"ten-string guitar"""". Some of our American """"colleagues"""" evidently don't like the truth coming out about their dishonest """"scholarship"""".

As for wikipedia, be advised that I no longer oversee the accuracy of the """"ten-string guitar"""" page and this should now be considered as unreliable as most of the other misleading ten-string guitar sites. The person presently responsible for the (from a musicological/organological point of view) misinformative wikipedia entry is Andrew Alder, whose musical """"expertise"""" as far as I can gather is limited to playing drums and rhythm guitar in his local Sydney Anglican church. Yet he too deems himself an """"authority"""" who is in a position to """"educate"""" readers about the 10-string guitar (an instrument he has no doubt never played).  

It is exactly this problem with wikipedia (that any lay person can edit it and can even become an administrator if they have too much free time on their hands and are willing to kiss enough derriere) that has caused it to be banned by universities and to be blamed for """"making kids dumb"""" and for falling grades of students who turn to this misinformative online """"encyclopaedia"""" for research.

Basically Etymology deals with various perspectives of a word and their history. It is absurd to quote that Maldives could have only been derived from Sanskrit. The literal English translation for Maladvipa is """"Garland of Flowers"""", and the Tamil(Malaithivu) and Malayalam(Maladwipu) terms used here too mean """"Garland of Flowers"""". This is the statement contained in the article, before User:SriSuren interfered with his POV discretely removing this content but retaining only the Sinhala translation. 

User:SriSuren keeps talking on trash about the old source and persistently attacking me with nonsensical accusations about my editing but is totally evasive on how this particular text(and with the source, which provides the accurate Tamil translation)

is supposedly 'WP:OR' or 'problematic'. Instead he simply rambles on accusing me of 'disruptive' editing, 3 vs 1 etc without explaining what exactly is in the text that needs to be modified. I have gone through his behavior in this talk page as well elsewhere, and I can see he has grossly abused these discussions, absolutely necessitating the need for Administrative action on his behavior, for disgracefully violating the TPGs. Almost all his edits(which have been consistently poised against the Tamil people in general need to be reviewed, and he needs to explain on what overall value he has added to wikipedia in his edits, except for adding/removing sensitive information that fulfills his whims) So perhaps, involvement of more editors to the issue will see through his low-down motives with which he edits, and the barbaric means he resorts to when he gets desperate. So I guess we let him do his course of job, as there is sadly not much room to deal with his uncivil and inflammatory behavior.  (talk . contr . mail) """,0

"(Undent) The other wikipedias dont call it a massacre because their sources do not call it a massacre. Arabic sources overwhelmingly do call it a massacre, and thus, the wiki being a product of its sources, the article is called the gaza massacre. This whole time you have been arguing that arabs shouldnt be calling it a massacre, that the facts dont support such a claim. That opinion, whether valid or not, is not what determines the name of an article, it is what the common name in the language for the event that determines the name. You cannot argue that the 2 wikis are discussing the same event, so to then argue that because of the common name for said event is in your mind, and understandably so, non-neutral that we should then censor that undermines core principles of the wikis. Yes the wiki should server to convey facts and hopefully transfer knowledge, but what we think are facts are almost always perceptions of facts. It boggles my mind that something that should be as trivial as asking what is the common term associated with an event in a given language needs to be so difficult. If arabs are calling this event the gaza massacre, then surprise! the name of the article will be the gaza massacre.",0
"""=Unbalanced critique===

The psychotherapy article needs a balanced critique section. The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse.  

Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts. I suspect that this is partly why self-respecting people who are knowledgeable don't want to be involved in what is otherwise a very worthy undertaking.

I disagree that it barely meets the notability guidelines. You have failed to mention other career highlights, such as the music video that was then filmed at Fenway Park on September 25th, 2012.

Responses:
1 - I was not referring to this, only your posts on Wikipediocracy recently.
2 - I was not referring to these events dating back to 2009, it does not appear relevant to your actions now.
3 - I am sure people can refer to the Arbcom case for the facts if they wish. I did review the situation with a sitting Arbcom member before starting RFA, as you are aware.
4 - This is the first time I have heard about it. It seems a bit late to be digging this up now.
5 - I know nothing about this, your page was not even on my watch-list until today.
6 - No, I was not even aware of """"revenge nominations"""". If I ever commented in a DR related to this, it was not as part of any pattern and I do not recall ever doing so. I do not watch everything you do on Commons, nor did I watch everything Russavia did. I am not Russavia, nor do I take responsibility for his actions. If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.
7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons. The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.

Your 7 responses appear to avoid the central issue, which is how you are now using Wikipediocracy to hound me. You appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. If you have allegations to make, please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then I can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.

Again, you are digging through history, some of which is 7 years old and the most recent is now 3 years old. It would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud, most of which I have forgotten as I have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.

""""At what point does an editor here pass your threshold for what constitutes a non-newbie?"""" As for Delta/Triangle (sorry, I don't know how to make triangles on my keyboard), I concluded at the time that he was a newbie for the reasons I mentioned above. It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.

""""If you believe images should be retained without there being a rationale for that use present..."""" Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages, or are being deliberately churlish. I didn't say anything about images being retained without a rationale. I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale, and if you're either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this, then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion.

I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate, as I'm quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others, as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other people's mouths constitutes """"discussion"""".

"Overall a Good Article 

Custer was a tricky fellow.  He was actively idolized and utterly despised even in his own time.  Ironically the people that hate him today for fighting the Native Americans would be on the Grant Administration's side - who hated him for publically defending their rights.  As for his competance, that was always open too.  Being a balls to the wall aggressive cavalryman doesn't make him a military genius but being so, winning, and surviving is close.  And in the end, close isn't always good enough.  After Gettysburg he encountered General Longstreet and tried to convince General Lee's stout lieutenant he had him outnumbered and out gunned.  He requested Longstreet's surrender in person.  Longstreet ordered his staff to bring several Confederate divisions up to attack including General Pickett's.  In reality these divisions existed only on paper and Pickett's was crushed at Gettysburg.  But Custer bought Longstreet's bluff and retreated with his tail between his legs.",0

 If this is of any assistance 
Here is a copy of the list I last posted over at the Juggernaut Talk page of the small part of Asgardian's past offenses that I had the energy to look up when I originally wrote it. I have also asked User:Nightscream to contribute. Feel free to add anything that you may not have known previously:

Asgardian being a proven sockpuppet user, which turns suspicious whenever various anonymous ips have reverted to his edits: 

Asgardian's block page for consistent edit-warring, before starting to simply do one revert a day or so to get away with it, regardless if this is in direct violation of consensus, like in the Dormammu case:  

Newer conflicts:  

User: J Greb noticing that Asgardian has continually written edit-summaries that have little, or nothing to do with what he's actually doing, or even flat-out contradict it, and Asgardian stating that he'll continue to do so as long as he can get away with it:  """"I've grown very, very tired of edits like this where the editor does multiple things and then puts in a partially truthful edit summary."""" Response: """"As for J Greb's concern, I've made a request to be directed to the relevant rule on Wikipedia."""" 

User: Nightscream noticing Asgardian's tendency for dishonesty, to then accuse anyone who points if out for """"incivility"""", which given that he does what he always does makes it impossible to even respond: 

Asgardian recently apparently systematically vandalising page-structures just to make a point, and various other users making a plea to finally shut him down:    

Only the most recent situation of distorting profile content and deleting multiple references regardless that the information was entirely correct, and that the entire Talk population disagrees with him, and going by my experience on other pages such as Thanos he will eventually revert everything at a time when everyone else has mostly lost interest, even if he has to wait half a year to do so:  

(This proved prophetic, as most recently User:Duae_Quartunciae [warned] him of a ban if he continued to remove valid references, and he left the pages Dormammu alone for a few weeks after this, but then returned and did exactly the same thing all over again, despite that nobody agreed with him, with my main problem being that he essentially replaced referenced exact quotes with personal opinions.)

In addition, there was this old hint that he finds this behavior funny:  """"""""insidious misrepresentation""""...heh. How old are you?""""

That said, I have been reluctant to view him as a troll, since he does seem to try doing much more useful things than simply being a neverending nuisance for everyone in this """"community"""", myself in particular, despite , but reasoning and compromises (i.e. rewrite the sentences for better structure if you wish, but keep valid references and accuracy cor",0

"Cloverleaf terminal 

In researching the maps for the initially planed expansion of the airport, I couldn't find any evidence of plans for a cloverleaf shaped configuration with four terminal rings as was added to the article without naming a sourced by an IP last October. It is also very obvious from the maps, that such a configuration could only be built after major reconstruction in the area immediately south of the existing buildings, including the demolition of the power station and the taxiway overpass as well as parts of the air cargo building. It seems extremely unlikely that the plans ever called for such a comprehensive destruction of buildings from earlier expansion phases of the same plans. The historic urban planing maps also show no sign of an expansion of the airport beyond the current boundaries of its grounds.

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0

Informations not accurate are:
 Josip Broz was not a leader but a dictator for a lot of years: 35 years! The word leader means who has democratic election by people, leader is a guidance for spontaneous and free supporters! Broz used violence, repression, terrorism, massacres against jugoslav people and a lot of children in Bleiburg and other places!
 The word dictator is not citated even in the entire article: perhaps Broz was a saint or a religious leader?
 Some sources mention Mihailovic and royalist Serbs as first partisans while some other sources mention Broz and communists as first partisans: citation needed of both in the article!
 OZNA and UDBA are not citated even in the entire article: perhaps these organizations were products of Saint Spirit?
 Terrorism of repression is not citated even in the entire article: perhaps Goli otok an other prisons were in North Pole?
 Ethnic cleansing against Italians and exodus are not citated about foibe massacres!
 Repression of communist Broz's regime was valid for unity of Jugoslavia: this is a supposition. Probably democratic system was most valid for liberty of every single Republic of jugoslav federation and now we could see Jugoslavia united and democratic without wars and we could see italian soldiers in their nation not in Kosovo and Bosnia!
 Broz was not benevolent dictator: he was like Lenin or Castro!

Mr. Haider, the theory that Pashtuns are an East Iranian people is the most scientific theory about Pashtun origin based on linguistic and anthropological studies/evidences contrary to other theories which are just wild speculations and fantastic fairy tales. So please, now that Pashtun ethnography has taken proper course, don't push it back to speculative histography by making irrational proclaimations that """"Pashtuns are an old race of its own"""" and that """"Pashtuns are great"""". This is an encyclopedia article and it should relect the dominent academic view about Pashtun origin instead of folkloric myths. 

Further, in detail every ethnic group has a distinct culture but on general level, different ethnic groups align with each other to form super groups with the same cultural, linguistic, and ethnic roots. There really was a proto-Iranian language, ethnicity, and culture. Anthropology, linguistics, and even social structure align Pashtuns with other Iranian people. This is a fact that cannot be refuted with mere sermises and conjectures.

I further inform the editors that Pashtun population in Karachi was 1.1 millions according to 1998 census of Pakistan. That might have swelled to at most 1.3-1.4 millions by now. I request the editors to exclude the statement like """"Pashtuns are twice the number of Pashtuns in Afghanistan"""" because, first proper population census of Afghanistan are yet to be held and second this statement would unnecessarily propogate the impression that """"Pashtuns are now well integrated in one state or the other"""".

The Base Commander of CFB Borden is Colonel Stewart E. Moore. Colonel Moore also serves as the Commander of Canadian Forces Support Training Group. The Canadian Forces Support Training Group validates, coordinates and delivers all common support occupation training for the Canadian Forces.

On average, CFB Borden trains 15,000 military personnel annually. CFB Borden employs approximately 3,250 military members and approximately 1,500 civilians

CFB Borden is located approximately 100 Km north of Toronto, in the heart of Simcoe County, one of the major tourist areas in Ontario. CFB Borden is ideally located to service personnel from all across Canada. The base is a major economic entity in Simcoe County and enjoys excellent relations with the surrounding local communities- http://www.borden.forces.gc.ca/cfb_borden/index_e.asp

"Hi Hanna Simpson. Thank you for the message. I tried to clean up the references you added. Just for reference, there's nothing wrong with citing non-English sources as long as they satisfy WP:RS, but if you do then it's sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per WP:RSUE. This can be added to the citation template using the  parameter (See Template:Cite web#Quote). Translations do not have to be professional quality; They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article. 
Regarding COI, you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at User talk:Materialscientist#Ottoneum. That doesn't mean you can never edit the article, but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make. COI editing is not expressly prohibited, but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WP:PSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are. Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited. Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it; Rather, articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something.

Conflation of the two """"brook"""" homonyms

that crosses between two other bodies of water. This may be US usage but it certainly is not of the UK. (thus """"brooking"""" them) The stream brook derives from Anglo-Saxon broc. The acceptance verb derives from AS brucan. There seems to be little connection. Also the Scottish term for a creek. It is not particularly Scottish. And has to do with creek only in the US usage. ( 08:43, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))

 RJP was correct that the two brook homonyms were being conflated.  AHD4 says that brook the transitive verb (""""To put up with; tolerate"""") comes from Middle English brouken, from Old English brūcan, """"to use, enjoy"""". (BTW, that's interesting, because today's German verb brauchen can mean """"to use"""". Clearly cognate.)

 Meanwhile, brook the noun (""""stream"""") is a homonymous word coming from a different root, via Middle English, from Old English brōc.

  

Section was missing

is part of the article missing?  the last section is empty.  
thalweg says """"see below"""" but there is nothing there. [alex]

Changes to the article
I propose that the """"Types of water streams"""" section be changed. I have been unable to corroborate the brook definition given. The definition I found most often is a stream smaller in size than a creek. It is also used when the water source is a spring or seep. When """"stream"""" is not used in the generic sense, I've found various definitions. Some have it as being the smallest of all and some have it as just below a river. I guess we can continue only giving the generic definition.   

Better image was wanted

I feel that the first image, of a """"running stream,"""" is not very accurate, given we see water still enough for duckweed to accumulate in large amounts.  I don't doubt that it could be a flowing system, but it is hardly what I picture when I close my eyes and think """"running stream.""""  Nitpicky, yes.  

Looking at the current version of the article, this appears to have been fixed.  

 Categories suggestions 
Suggestion:  Make a category about Daylighting (streams) for neighborhoods (plese see article also—the list is already getting long), sections # Some neighborhoods with daylighting projects and # Other places.  A child article or something will eventually need be spun off.

Since each daylighted stream exists only as an intimate component of the neighborhoods of the watershed, linking the streams and neighborhoods in a category could be very useful.  Various daylighting projects exist all over the world, though so far we have Seattle, San Francisco, and Berkeley.  There exist similar projects restoring natural areas in urban settings, distinct from parks.  One is Union Bay Natural Area, another is a marsh north of San Francisco or in northern California (Eureka?) that is also providing habitat and tertiary sewage treatment, rather than having been drained.  (The most-recognized level is conventional secondary treatment.)

Suggestion:  Make a category of natural areas in urban settings.  This is tangentially related to the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative at Salish Sea.

Comments, discussion?  How to tie into existing, relevant articles?

The Daylighting (streams) article could use more diverse examples

 

Stream is limited to Southern England?
I'm sorry, but the quote 'Stream is limited to Southern England,' in reference to the word 'stream' itself is total nonsense.Only the broadest of Yorkshiremen, for example, use only the word 'beck.' I am not adversed to words like these being mentioned in the stream article, but can people please try to avoid making such sweeping statements about them?  

Beck was one used in London as in Tooting bec near Wandsworth and a few Burns in Scotland are also officaly known as Streems or Brooks.  86.29.241.101

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides. I don’t see how journalistic opinionating and scholarly opinion is anything more than just opinion.67.168.126.47  17:57, 27",0

Speedy deletion of Saints of the Underground

""""In 2004, Croatia added an amendment to the penal code which prohibits historical revisionism of genocides and crimes against humanity.http://www.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeno/2004/2026.htm Another amendment was added in 2006 to prohibit any type of hate crime based on factors such as race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion or national origin.http://www.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeno/2006/1706.htm""""

The first claim cannot be justified by anything in the reference aimed to support the claim. The penal code changes are not about 'prohibits historical revisionism of genocides and crimes against humanity' as claimed above. The second one looks like as stated, but completed by the rights of the Croatian Parliament to interpret the same law - allows the nacionalistic ruling parties to adjust these changes to their current political aims.

 Italian 

Hey Sajoch, if you can discuss things relaxed for a bit, I do have a question I'd like to ask a Ladin from Bolzano.  I always hear about the Italians coming and taking over.  But, can you explain to me who exactly are """"the Italians""""?  As far as I know, Italian in the modern sense is simply a citizen of the Italian Republic.  Going back a few hundred years ago, I suppose people might say they are a people """"of Italy"""", or the Italic peninsula.  But, I'd say that even to this day, many people in Italy don't refer to themselves as Italian first.  Aren't the people of Sicily, Sicilians?  The people of Napoli, Napolitani?  As far as I can tell, the """"Ladin"""" are the people of the region we happen to call Trentino-Alto Adige, and also the Romansch speakers in Switzerland are speaking essentially the same (or a VERY similar) language.  It would make sense that this pocket of Europe has its own particular language, and a language which is old-Latin based.  So, when you say you are Ladin, and not Italian... to me that is no different from someone saying they are Sicilian, and not Italian.  Then that brings me back to my original question: who is actually Italian?  Isn't the Italian language the Tuscan language actually?  So are Italians actually the people from Tuscany?  I know that Trentino is said to be majority Italian, but the people there speak Italian in modern times because it is the national language.  They still speak their original dialects like Nones, Solardo, etc.. which are actually Ladin languages.  You know that, right?  So are the people in Trentino Ladin people, or have they transformed into Italians because the Italian Republic has a National Language?  I'm just throwing these questions out there, as someone interested in my own history.  I mentioned this once to noclador, """"who are the Italians?"""" and all the discussion got me was him giving me the link to the Wikipedia page on Italians.  My guess is that some of the questions I was asking blurred the lines of a politics he would rather dream is black and white.  I'd like to see if you'd actually be interested to discuss this, as you are a fellow Ladin at least...""",0

 And there is no prove, that Raphael """"imitated"""" anything from Michelangelo. Some of his early works closely follows those of Perugino, but better find one which follows Michelangelo. There is a big diference between """"imitation"""" and """"influence"""". Raphael was influenced by Michelangelo and Michelangelo was influenced by Signorelli (by his own words) and there is no sense to state about """"shameless imitations"""" at all. Now, about Parmigianino and Pontormo being influenced by Last Judgement and Capella Paolina frescoes - I only pointed out obvious fact - Parmigianino was already dead by the time Michelangelo finished LJ and started Paolina frescoes and as I knew Pontormo never was in Rome at the time and later. Probably those things comes from Kenney Mencher online lectures, filled with timeline errors. He even thinks Correggio (d. 1534) was influenced by LJ, which is bizarre. As for """"Battle of Centaurs"""", there is well known earlier print by Antonio del Pollaiolo which is usually pointed out as possible influence on laster masculine florentine art.

 Not to worry...jdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer. 

I have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100% accurate and verifiable. I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a """"estimation"""" at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.

PS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.

I will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)""",0

Hello there.... I've been noticing that you have been reverting User Magnagr which is highly appreciated. I just wanted to fill you in... he has a long history of vandalizing articles such as Radio, Nikola Tesla, AC motor, Induction motor, Tesla coil, and many others. I have added all of these articles to my watchlist because of him.

In fact, he has numerous alias which he goes by. He previously used the name Altes2009 before he changed it to Magnagr. If you check, both use the same IP address. Like you, I have continually reverted his edits as has . He has a long repeated history of not accepting consensus on the content of articles. What do you think we should do about him?",0

"""==Hm?==
Hi, I am Mishae, I would like to know if the indefinite block of user You have no nipples was fair. I'm not an admin, but maybe it would have been better to put him under topic ban instead? Not to mention, your block came after a warning, after which he didn't edit that or any other article. I personally invited him to WikiProject Pornography after seeing his sandbox. Regards,  
Since all that user's edits were obvious vandalism, including the sandbox, and the username further suggests an intention not to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, this was a routine block (the kind that the template  is regularly used to deal with). Regards,   (Edgar181) 
O.K, but don't you need to give a user a last warning before you block him/her? Not to mention, in sandbox a user have a right to write what he wants as long as he is not attacking anyone and it doesn't get out.  
There is no requirement in the blocking policy for a """"last warning"""" before a user can be blocked. And there are other types of inappropriate content in a user's sandbox than just attacks on other users (and it doesn't matter if it """"gets out"""" or not either).    (Edgar181) 
O.K. By last warning I ment this. He wasn't attacking other users just writing nipples and You have no nipples (in the very end). Is it dumb? Yes. Either way, if he will get unblocked feel free to give me a ping, and I will sent him to adoption.  

Ironically, I'm unhappy that  was not indeffed, as they've only ever pushed their POV, and they've had enough warnings (edit-summary based, and one on their talk page), and a prior block, yet haven't contributed anything anywhere else.  (tell Luke off here) 
Thank you. )  (tell Luke off here) 
(ec) I guess I didn't realize that the disruptive edits at Coventry City F.C. were their entirely of contributions to Wikipedia.  Upon review, it's clear that all edits are disruptive and that this user has no intention of contributing constructively.  Therefore, I agree with you that an indefinite block would be more appropriate and I have modified the block accordingly.  Regards,    (Edgar181) 

 Article Feedback Tool update 

Hey Edgar181. I'm contacting you because you're involved in the Article Feedback Tool in some way, either as a previous newsletter recipient or as an active user of the system. As you might have heard, a user recently anonymously disabled the feedback tool on 2,000 pages.  We were unable to track or prevent this due to the lack of logging feature in AFT5.  We're deeply sorry for this, as we know that quite a few users found the software very useful, and were using it on their articles.

We've now re-released the software, with the addition of a logging feature and restrictions on the ability to disable. Obviously, we're not going to automatically re-enable it on each article—we don't want to create a situation where it was enabled by users who have now moved on, and feedback would sit there unattended—but if you're interested in enabling it for your articles, it's pretty simple to do. Just go to the article you want to enable it on, click the """"request feedback"""" link in the toolbox in the sidebar, and AFT5 will be enabled for that article.

Again, we're very sorry about this issue; hopefully it'll be smooth sailing after this ). If you have any questions, just drop them at the talkpage. Thanks!

Evanh, despite your claim above that there is """"no other logical way of looking at it,"""" there obviously is. GabeMc, DocKino, Radiopathy, and Hotcop are all just as logical as you. And despite your proclamation about """"objective reality,"""" this is very clearly a matter of something else, that being interpretation. So...
The well-established status quo of the article is that it states the Bealtles were active exclusively from 1960 to 1970. Procedurally, any contested alteration to that must gain a consensus—it obviously has not. Furthermore, looking over all the evidence brought forward in this discussion, I would say that by a small but definite margin, the relevant sources do not treat what happened in '94–'96 as equivalent to the Beatles being active.—  00:33""",0
""":::::: Now, would you please let me know how can someone """"dispute the relevance or accuracy of a section, then, by definition, it is controversial and disputed."""" I remember when Pecher wanted to remove the disputed tags, he asked us to find a reliable source proving that the article is disputed. As much as I rememeber, you agreed with him that Jewish Encyclopedia is not enough to prove that the article is disputed. All of the editors working on this article except Pecher believe we can use JE """"usless contradicted by modern peer reviewed journal"""". Would you please let us know how can one dispute the material from JE. Thanks.  

 I also agree with you that it's best to use modern sources. If any of us finds one such source and observes that there is a contradiction, it will establish that Jewish Encyclopedia (JE) is outdated. Still, it is hard for me to believe that JE gets greatly outdated on something that has happened many centuries before.

Hi. I've restored your version of the code for the template header, so that it appears within the infoboxas is standardrather than above it. This, and adding a couple optional info lines, has brought me to the limits of my coding ability.

When I attempt this with Infobox Network (that is, either erasing the """"name"""" line or leaving it blank, under any of the recent iterations of the header code), it leaves a little rogue vertical mark in the linespace above the logo image, insteading of eliminating the linespace altogether.

"""It's really very difficult to let you down gently, because I find myself accused by you of edit warring which I totally reject. I understand that you might be doing it to pacify Tiamut but it’s unfair to do it at my expense. If I should speak softly then the above wrong image of me might stick in someone’s mind, which is unfair to me. This version that you are reading is a toned down version of the original. If I still hurt you (HG), then I apologize, as my intention is only to clear a wrong image of me in your mind and by extension in the mind of others.

I'm sorry to say, but you're totally off base. I'll take it that you haven't followed the sequence of events and are totally unaware of who edited what. If you would have checked out the exact sequence of events you couldn't have come to such conclusions and made such comments.

Frankly, I am very disappointed in you trying to equate us. While my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that I'm here to add my knowledge on Jewish subjects for which I have barely scratched the surface, and although I am bold,  I go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of Wikipedia. Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.

Here are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.

Her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   

It's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise Wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. I’m really fed up with Wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

"Controversies - Did he had conspired 9/11? 

I don't want to make Wikipedia offended (primarily the article), but I think it's strange that he had financed to implode the buildings on the World Trade Center. I don't think it would be relevant in the article by Wikipedia's standards or if I would receive a notification on disruption or something like that. Here I go. 

He is a Jewish person right? He wanted to implode the buildings for a war on Islam. Secondly, there was a television tower on top of the World Trade Center - does that seem weird to you people? That was all done for capitalism, propaganda, scare tactics, exploitation and viewers? No one talks about that. The television agencies wanted them to blame Islam for good measure, because of oil.  Oil, television agencies, government power, and lobbyist, in a government operated building. This man who had made up 9/11 is Jewish… It was all over religions… Jews versus Islams… Now governmental Jews are in power again only because of this incident …
Just months before 9/11, there was over $3.4 trillion dollars financed to the city, and they agreed to this situation; however, he had gained profit from the victims, which he's at $7 billion (USD). He had knew about the asbestos before he had bought the World Trade Center in 1980's. Plus the towers of 2, 3, 4, and 7 - were over $10 billion (USD - with tax).

So, the British sided with the Americans, and the current border reflects the American claim?
What were the differences between this and the Canadian claim? - Unsigned User:Geo Swan

Actually, the current boundary does not reflect the maximal U.S. claim.  I'll try to trype in some more info.   

The British didn't exactly side with the Americans; the border settlement was an arbitration (the Kaiser again, IIRC, as it had been with his father at the end of the San Juans Dispute).  The British backed down because of threats by T.E. Roosevelt that he would invade and annex British Columbia if he didn't get his way.  The main difference between the British hard position and the way things are now is that under the British terms, thet """"Yukon Ports"""" - Skagway and Haines and Dyea etc would have been """"British"""", i.e. part of British Columbia.

Canada didn't have a say in it, other than consulting London; British North American (Canadian) foreign affairs were still in London's bailiwick at that time (until 1931 or 1927 or something).

As it is under the treaty, the site of Forts Stikine and Taku should be within British Columbia; and in fact the mouths of the Stikine and Taku should be, but they've silted in a few miles downstream since the treaty was signed; the border hasn't been revised to reflect that (obviously not, even though it's in the language; same thing with the mis-survey of the 49th Parallel that's not going to get corrected, either).

There are two sticking points remaining in the Alaska Boundary Settlement.  One is that the treaty stipulates that the western shoreline of the Portland Canal is the boundary; US maps continue to show mid-channel.  Similarly with the A-B Line, which is between Point A and Point B on the north side of the Dixon Entrance; US maps show the boundary as being mid-Dixon Entrance, and the US/Alaska have even issued oil/drilling-exploration permits on """"their"""" side of that line.

Same kind of fudge-up with the Oregon Treaty; during the Salmon War of the mid-1990s Canadian commercial vessels (whale watching boats) were busted by US Coast Guard in the area of the San Juans; but the treaty is very clear that ALL commercial vessels south of the 49th Parallel are to be unhindered; that would even include in Rosario Strait, far from the current border in the Haro Strait; during the same kafuffle Sen. Slade Gorton (State-Sen) in Washington invoked the treaty to demand free passage through the Johnstone Strait for American fishing vessels (nothing of the kind is guaranteed in the Oregon Treaty, or for that matter in the Alaska treaty either) and called on the US Navy to enforce the """"international waterway"""" (which is all of a mile wide in spots).  Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a """"foreign port"""" to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed. 

Further Thoughts

Just considering the opening statements; the treaty was actually between the British Empire, with the Dominion of Canada as a signatory party, IIRC; BC was not involved in the actual signing.

And just as aside the phrasing of the second condition of the treaty cited:

Whenever the summit of the mountains shall be at a distance of more than ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.

...is completely bizarre for anybody who's ever actually looked at a map of the coastline.  The negotiators were in London and Washington and Ottawa, far away with only the dimmest idea of where they were talking about.  Much the same as the Oregon Treaty, only worse; there """"the deepest channel"""" seemed at least a bit logical, even though they didn't note the issues on the map with Point Roberts and the Gulf Islands/San Juans which make that border a bit of an absurdity; which so is the 49th Parallel from the Rockies west....that aside, the Alaska treaty issue cited is utterly bizarre; the Alaskan coast is a ragged array of inlets and bays, pierced by several large rivers.  There is no """"crest of the mountains"""", for one thing - other than crowsflight-drawn lines from high peak to high peak, which i",0

"""{{unblock | I am appealing a 48-hour block that was placed on me before I could post my response via the administrator's message board. I apologize in advance for the length of this but I believe that it's necessary to include all of these details. I wrote a summary at the end so that administrator's could get an overview if they don't have time to read the whole statement.

I will be addressing the claim that I violated the 1RR rule in the second paragraph of this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shapira

According to WP:BLP, """"Biographies of living persons  must be written conservatively and with regard to a subject's privacy..."""" 
In a book written in a foreign language, with a lot of jargon, there are often competing translations/interpretations. And a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes, misquotes, dubious translation and out-of-context statements. As per WP:BLP I think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used, and for the same reason, the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.

With than in mind on the 18th of February, I improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with WP:BLP based on this source.

user:Zero0000 -  responded to one of my edits by stating that [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzchak_Ginsburgh&diff;=538816167&oldid;=538810305 I """"can't read.""""] And in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a Wikipedia administrator, told me in as many words to get off Wikipedia.""""Take a break"""" I didn't take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which I was told by said individual that I had """"behavioral problems.""""
Said individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics """"I started to write a complaint against you"""" (why do I need to know that? He can let me know when he posts it) and then later responding to another edit he didn't like by saying that """"it was on my charge sheet.""""

Now the reason I am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1RR issue:
After posting my version of the paragraph, user:Zero0000 subsequently changed it to this.

I will post only the first few words of his statement and the source:

Source: """"There is a reason to kill babies [on the enemy side""""]

user:Zero0000: [""""Babies [on the enemy side may be killed .""""]

After those first few words, user:Zero0000 continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. Now at best this is a serious distortion. 

And when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing, sometimes contradictory sources, rationales, theories, proposals, and ideas; many of which are subsequently discounted, limited in scope, or just tossed by the wayside, the disparity the statement """"may be done"""" and """"there is a reason"""" is even greater.

Aside from the distortion mentioned above, in contradiction to WP:BLP user:Zero0000 also opted for a particularly liberal out-of-context translation.

Why did user:Zero0000 replace my edit with his own. His statement:
(prefer source with an actual quotation)

As I showed above, he didn't use an actual quotation.

Furthermore, after seeing his comment, I searched but wasn't able to find any Wikipedia reference to a such a preference, leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT on me without explanation. 

His actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multi-pronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in (i.e. encouraging me """"take a break"""").NEWLIN",0

Anons concerns cont'd

On the grav-locked, red dwarf planet:

Note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like Io, so it's not as if everything will freeze on the night side. The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it's fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter's great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the """"sun pole"""" and falling at the """"dark pole"""", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don't even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I'm unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism's job: for example a plant doesn't need the night """"mode"""" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.

Based on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let's plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.

Organizationally, perhaps the best thing would be to treat Earth-like planets in the main flow of the article: then discuss tidally-locked red dwarf planets, with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux; and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons, like Titan and Europa. Perhaps (keeping original numbers):

1 Suitable star systems

 1.1 Spectral class
 3.1 Binary systems (since all but the closest binaries are ok, put it here)
 1.2 A stable habitable zone

2 Planetary characteristics

 2.1 Mass
 1.3/2.2 Acceptable energy variation (as I hope I showed about, """"low"""" isn't really necessary; include the case of Jovian moons in the HZ)
 1.4 High metallicity (it comes from system formation but it's a planet property)
 2.3 Geochemistry (maybe combine with metallicity?)

3 Alternative biologies
 3.2 Red dwarf systems (tidally locked; low light?)
 NEW Chemosynthesis-based biology.

4 on, no changes.

I should add, this is a really good article. Maybe I'm trying to gild the lily.

 Mistake ? 
I am not a specialist but """"Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere [10]."""" (mass paragraph) seems doubtful to me. I mean, Mars still has volcanoes (Mount Olympus for example) so it sees strange to me that it's geologically dead, but once again I am no specialist.  

Mars does have volcanoes, but as far as I know, they're not really active, so nothing is really """"powering them"""" and geological activity isn't really showing up.   
Luna, Earth's Moon has volcanoes, and it's accepted as geologically dead. The presence of volcanoes doesn't mean ACTIVE volcanoes. 
That's basically what I was trying to say, I guess I just never made it really clear.  

 Picture Size 
Can a larger size by found for the Habitability Zone picture? I'd like to use it as a background, but it won't scale up. 

I downloaded it here:  http://library.thinkquest.org though I can't remember the exact spot on the site. An image search for habitable zone turns it up first thing, but only at 19k...

"Hey,
No body is commenting on the ABO blood group study which is a scientific study. Also this Rajput 999 user is using derogatory remarks and violating the Wiki policy. So did you ban him? How neutral are you as an administrator or Sitush is when none of you guys are commenting on the scientfic study. Someone mentione dthat this study is old so it is not a good study to rely as it was conducted 40-50 years ago. What kind if argument was this? If a study is old it does not mean it is not quotable and if a study is recent does not automatically make it a ground breaking study. If you as an adn=ministrator want to ban the article, go ahead an do it. Who cares about this Wikipedia site when it is managed by administrators like you. That is why it is said that little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Go ahead and ban me or whosoever you want to and ban this article. Next time when Wikipedia appeals for its users to sign the petition so that it  not banned I will think twice because now I know it is run by some arrogant and biased people. You do not even know how to talk on the social site. i will be waiting for this candy on Halloween aka your ban, jerk. Sitush has mentioned as on March 6th 2012 somewhere else on Wiki site that he would read all the sources available in 3-4 days and then reach on a conlusion about this articel. he must be genius that he will read all these references  written over such a long period of time and then decide in 3-4 days. What was he doing prior to March 6th and if did not ahve all the knowledge why was he suggesting corrections. It proves how biased he is?",0

"Helder, I agree with you on one point, and it may surprise you which point it is: the loosers of the Cold War were indeed 'the people'. Now that the communist threat is gone, it's no longer necessary to accommodate basic decency in dealing with employees, for example. I have worked on the bottom of the food chain long enough to know how many liberties some employers take with their employees. The irony is, of course, that out of fear of Communism, working conditions in the West were much better than in Communist countries. I still think the masses are cowardly, nasty, stupid, and disgusting in general. But, that's regardless of who they are made up of. Any assembly of people that exceed about a hundred people tends to take on disgusting behaviour. Just watch frat parties at 'elite' universities. Yuck. You don't even need 100 people for that. Humanity as such is vile, it's only redeeming feature is the occasional decent human being. My support for democracy is not based on any kind of sympathy with 'the masses', but it's simply based on the realization that there are no better alternatives. I am a Popperian democrat  democracy as a necessity, not moral imperative. The losing side of any revolution is always humanity (Menschlichkeit, not Menschheit; I trust you know enough German to get the difference). 

The famines inflicted on India, Ireland, and post-WWI Germany are just one of the few examples of how humans in general are simply disgusting. By the way, according to new findings in archeology, genocide was the method of choice in dealing with enemies for most of human history. Whether the 'noble savages', the carriers of 'white man's burden', the 'Ubermenschen', or the 'Avantgarde of the Proletariat', humans have not gotten better or worse throughout history, but have simply found new excuses for their native instincts.

Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish """"Cross""""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is """"Jewish"""". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not """"ethnically"""" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is """"Black"""" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is """"Jewish"""" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had """"Jewish mother"""". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her """"Jewish"""", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't """"ethnically"""" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under """"some guy's website"""". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.  """,0

 Since I won't be around to implement this - do with it as you will. 

I have written up, what I think would be a working compromiseand was going to post it on Mcshithead's talk page but since he has been such an asshole and will never collaborate with another view... trouble is he runs the place and is so afraid of me he is shitting his pants with every word I write...LOL, and you have had your pee-pee slapped because McGod is afraid of you too.

Anyway here goes.

 Compromise. I can understand almost all the views of most people's concerns, here. As a compromise, to most, I would like to offer a possible solution to address most of those concerns for this otherwise conundrum:
 Extend Andreasegde's Triangular Diplomacy II solution from 2011! Before  anybody freaks-out, please read the rest. This solution  would continue to promote the usage of pronoun references to band names, mid-sentence while still retaining the ability to occasionally use the band's name or individual member references, mid-sentence. Complaints about the usage of all pronouns making boring, repetitive, prose in the article would be addressed by  adding this addendum to the previous Triangular Diplomacy II solution, already observed by many.
 Mid-sentence usage of  both, """"The Beatles"""" and """"the Beatles"""" be permitted, occasionally with these caveats:
Provided an identifying phrase is used to indicate usage, 
 When referring to band members,  a lowercase """"t"""" should be used ie. """"the Beatles"""",
 when referring to the band, as a corporate whole,  an uppercase """"T"""" should be used. ie. """"The Beatles"""".

 Some Examples:
 """"The Beatles were a rock band of great accomplishment."""" = capitalisation is always used at the beginning of a sentence, regardless.
 """"Paul became a Beatle"""" = obvious individual (non-group) reference, no """"the"""" or identifying phrase needed.
 """"Paul became one of the most popular members of The Beatles band"""" = whole group reference with """"band"""" identifier and also obvious context.
 """"Paul became one of most long-lived members of The Beatles band"""" = group reference with """"band"""" identifier and obvious context.
 """"George Martin became involved with The Beatles group later."""" = """"group"""" clarifies corporate group usage meaning.
 """"After the event the individual Beatles went separate  ways"""" = """"individual"""" clarifies individual member context.
 """"After the event the Beatles individuals went separate  ways"""" = """"individuals"""" clarifies.
 """"After the event The Beatles members went separate  ways"""" = members clarifies the band/group. (a gotcha').
 If people have other extreme examples, perhaps we can see them in order to fine tune and clarify to satisfy almost all collaborative editors.
This solution could resolve most of the concerns stated in this medcom proceding. Future editing from newer editors may violate these seemingly complicated rules but would be easy to fix with addition of either simple words or cap correction and a references to some posted (MOS?) rules. The only arguments (I can see) that may arise would be whether the band or the individual members are being referred to. The simple fix, for these disputes, would be to return that particular sentence back to the Triangular Diplomacy solution. This would appear to be inline with hundreds of other musical articles already observing a similar de facto standard. Any violations would be easy to correct and violations would not look outside of most grammar usage anyway. I don't really see any other way to satify so many different concepts, here. Trademarks don't work and the MOS contradicts itself and grammar in many places.
If this solution is even remotely desired by the majority, and/or medcom team, here, this could be fine tuned by controlled input to medcom  mediators. Also implementation methods for clarifying to newcomers would need input on how to set up the MoS page, possibly. Beyond my knowledges. This MoS should apply to all musical articles, if we can make it work.
Have a nice life! If I am still here in a few hours Iwill drop back in harrass the crap out of you some more! ROFL!

Notice
This article focuses on the military campaign, while the American Revolution covers the origins of the war, as well as other social and political issues.

Please try to keep this article at a reasonable length. The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the general reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of war strategies, battle casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions.

Instead of adding additional detail to this lengthy article, consider adding your information to an article on a specific battle, or to one of these campaign articles currently in development. Additionally, one campaign, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga (box at right), does not yet have an article specifically about those operations. Perhaps you will start it Miguel!

NPOV

Reading this article it looks like the US won the war solo, with some assistance (which was mostly inept) from some other countries, one of which happened to be France.  This is evident in the introduction and throughout the article.  The introduction is particularly blatant, mentioning non-American intervention only as an after thought.  Should the WWI and WWII articles mention American intervention as an afterthought too? Am I the only one to think this is a problem?   

I have edited the intro so that it is less laughable.    
I agree especially Yorktown   

Casualties
I think that the casualty figures in this article are incorrect, as 25,000 Americans died in all, and 24,000 British and their allies.

"Source Deletion 

Hi, just wanted to let you know I restored a table to the Nestle-Aland page.  Not sure why you didn't notify me that you were removing it.  In any case, I found this source through a Roman Catholic, and it has an imprimatur from that church.  I've found other scholarly reviews for it as well, including a peer review from the Society of Biblical Literature.  Although I'm sure yours was a good faith edit and a simple mistake, I'm a bit concerned that you didn't ask me about it.

I'm also concerned after glancing at your user contribs that you do a LOT of source deletion without discussing this with the other good faith editors that have taken time and research to provide.  Although we do need to have sources cleaned up here, we'd actually get along faster if you slow down a bit and discuss the sources with the editors who have provided them.  It's a simple courtesy, and would save us all time redoing earlier work.  It's tough writing an encyclopedia, but continuously REwriting it is even harder.

Just so you'll know, I do not add sources that I do not personally own.  I have a rather extensive library, and often purchase books for the purpose of responsibly editing on this site.  It's a rather expensive exercise and requires more time than simply deleting sources I'm not familiar with.  There have been times that I did not like a source that was listed, and bought several other sources in order to rebuild or supplement information that was insufficiently verified.

Again, this is a slower and more expensive process than simple deletion.  I'd appreciate it if you do the same.  If you don't mind, could you let me know if you have deleted other sources I've provided on this site?  After some months away I was looking forward to adding sourced material in the field of stock technical analysis, but I'm now dreading having to go back and research any other places you may have deleted my earlier work in religious or literary subjects.  I'd appreciate any help you can give me here so I can move on to other subjects with minimal time restoring any sources that have been removed.

Thanks for your help.  And again, I'm sure it was a good faith mistake on your part.  I'd appreciate the same spirit in return.

 Yet another miscomprehension

In fact, everyone disagrees.

 Górny & Rosiknoń Witnesses to Mystery: Investigations Into Christ’s Relics

Ignatius is a serious Catholic publisher, I don't know why books published by them should be excluded from Wikipedia -except someone's hostility to Catholicism. If we exclude Górny, then we should also exclude Carrol-Cruz -catholic writer as well, and Nickell, sceptical writer, who is much more biased (against any relics) than any Catholic source -so his book is not the sort of book that should be used to write a neutral article. The statement is an opinion cited, not a fact. Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet -anyone can publish whatever wants. In the lead, we have two negative opinions, by Erasmus from 1500s, and by Thurston from 1913. So the lead is not neutral. To balance it, we have posititve Górny&Rosiko;ń opinion from 2013 -much more recent, after several researches on some relics (described in their book) have been published.

For the benefit of those who may be following this discussion, I'll post my clarification from your talk page:

""""Looking at the games in order of best sales, they'd be VII, X, VIII, IX, X-2, VI, etc. Obviously Sephiroth merits his own article, and Seymour probably makes sense as well, but out of the next titles, Kuja's got one while Ultimecia, Kefka and Shuyin don't. Given this and Kuja's already substantial section on the list of FFIX's characters, as well as the fact that describing IX's story comprehensively will require a pretty thorough explanation of him anyway (sales figures aside, he is the central conflict of the game, really; the same can't really be said of Seifer with VIII or Seymour in X; in order for them to get proper coverage, they'd have to get their own articles), it seems to me like him having his own article's kind of unnecessary. Any discussion of him is really a discussion of the game's story, and any discussion of the game's story is going to largely be a discussion of him, so I just think it will probably make for some somewhat unnecessary reiteration across the three articles (Final Fantasy IX, List of Final Fantasy IX characters and Kuja).

He's certainly a notable villain, though. I'm just saying that in light of the treatment of most of the other notable villains and given the already thorough treatment of Kuja's role, it seems somewhat unnecessary for him to have his own article.""""

""":: uhhh, we could also add Standford Shaw on the list and last time I checked, he was a western scholar. As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the """"good image"""" of Germany.  

 No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I'm glad you admit though that you don't care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.   

 I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!  

 Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don't even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.   

 First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!  

In theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren't """"settled"""". There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there's nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.  

 Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of 'scholars' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I've no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) """"The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike.

Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.

Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.

What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""".

 Is OhInternet a recreation of Encyclopedia Dramatica? 

To tangent from the above topics…

Oh Internet is not Encyopedia Dramatica as the article supposes. 'Encyclopedia Dramatica' is defined as the domain name 'www.encyclopediadramatica.com' and the intellectual property concerned with ED copyright. OhInternet, however is a different project entirely; notable differences: a new XML coding system, logo and form of satire. To use terms in the article: the site was not 'overhauled' but rather 'replaced'. 

To use Silverseren's analogy, if Wikipedia did rename itself, kept most of its higher administration and stopped using Wikimedia software would it still be Wikipedia? The answer is """"No"""". The Wikipedia name and intellectual property becomes inactive, lost. If one were to charge a Wikipedia fork site with copyright violations they would have to give evidence of their ownership of Wikipedia copyright and not that of the new 'OhKnowledge.com', the hypothetical Wikipedia replacement. (Sherrod, however does have evidence, so don't take this as a justification for the .ch). Once a site loses connection with the old name or any registered associated material it ceases to be the same entity. Oh Internet has no parallels to the old site at all. The position that the new site is ED just 'cleaned' should be removed from the article immediately.

Encyclopedia Dramatica, as defined, is dead. OhInternet is a whole new project – a de facto successor, but not 'ED'. The redirect was an attempt to maintain website hits but as many 3rd party websites will show, it didn't quite work out. The vast majority of the volunteer editors did leave. Site activity, growth and edit numbers are much higher at encyopediadramaticia.ch than at OhInternet. OhInternet’s declining popularity should first stabilize before any 'notability' assessment goes underway. 

Understandably the nature of ED.ch is illegal so I don't care for it immediate coverage. I like to think the site will cool down over time.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"massacre"""" and """"execution"""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.
The common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s",0

"It is contentious, rejected, disputed, poorly sourced, but I suppose tabloid journalism could be argued although sensationalizing a crime story is at the very heart of tabloid journalism. My main point is that we are likely running afoul of NPOV by not clearly linking these episodes as one man's 10-year effort to recast the murders. That his research rejects facts that don't align with his beliefs, his sourcing is poor, he exploits pretty much all the subjects, and his main points are pretty much rejected. The sourcing is there, but our structure is, perhaps unintentionally, misleading. I'm open to the best ways to address these issues.",0
"Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

Как упоителен, как роскошен летний день в Малороссии!  Как
томительно  жарки те часы, когда полдень блещет в тишине и зное

"Sandbox proposal for Wikipedia: Belarusian geographical names 

I just read User:Iryna Harpy/sandbox#Wikipedia: Belarusian geographical names and I applaud you for undertaking this effort.
However, while I appreciate the idea of using the romanization as used by the Belarusian government as the basis, the transliteration/transcription seems to be inconsistent between the various layers of government. That is, the website of the central government uses other romanizations than the websites of the regions. For instance, the website of Gomel Region uses Yelsk and Oktiabrskiy, while the website of the central government uses Elsk and Oktyabrskii. In addition, in your sandbox I find forms that are used on neither website. You write Svietlahorsk while both the central government website and the Gomel Region website use Svetlogorsk.

If this proposal is to have any chance of being adopted, I think it should as much as possible try to use the same source for most of its transcriptions. The central government website seems the most logical choice to me.

However, unfortunately, I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with the romanizations used by that website. Here's a few reasons why:
 the transcription of iotation / palatalization is wildly inconsistent:
 in some names, iotation/palatalization is not marked: Elsk, Svetlogorsk;
 in others, iotation/palatalization is marked using the letter y: Oktyabrskii, Kostyukovka;
 in yet others, the letter i is used for the same purpose: Liozno;
 in still others, the letter j is employed: Marjina Gorka;
 sometimes, in one part of the word iotation/palatalization is marked, while it isn't in another part of the same word: Myadel (Cyrillic , pronounced ).
 the ending  is inconsistently romanized. Compare Oktyabrskii and Pervomaiskiy (as a bonus, observe that the first i in Pervomaiskiy is a transcription of , which on the rest of the map is usually transcribed as y'').

Observing these inconsistencies, I am not convinced that using these romanizations is the solution. While BGN/PCGN may not be perfect, it is at least consistent. If this, this and this are the alternatives, I think we should stick to our existing policy of using BGN/PCGN. -",0
"I am not sure how this makes it any less cumbersome.  Before the change, there was Armour with its listings for melee, mage, and range, followed by Weaponry with its lisings for melee, mage, and range, which is a total of six subheadings.  Now the article has Melee with its listings for armour and weaponry, then Mage with its listings for armour and weaponry, and then Range with its listings for armour and weaponry, which is still a total of six.  We have gone from two main headings to three main headings.

The direction we want to go needs to be decided.  Do we want to talk about armour and weaponry as topics and then break them down between the various classes?  Do we want to talk first about the class (styles) of combat and then break them down between armour and weapons?  My thought was, obviously, the first choice, while QuagmireDog seems to think it should be the second.  I do not think that either is more correct than the other.  They are just different ways of thinking about it or looking at it.  Which will give our readers more useful information without delving into that pit of fancruft our critics are lightning-fast to jump on?  Remember that we still need to bring the rest of the general combat information into this at some point - things like the combat triangle, player versus player combat, etc.",0

If you jump on anyone who uses a talk page for anything less pure than """"discussing how to improve the article,"""" you're going to be a very busy bee indeed, and probably to little effect.
I wasn't """"offended"""" because Santamoly disrespected my religion (Voudon isn't my religion), I was appalled and disgusted (see my original reply to you) at her/his provincial and outdated attitude toward a perfectly legitimate religion, and made my point firmly.  I admitted to you that I could have been less snarky, but that wouldn't do.
Apparently, people only have a """"proper sense of judgement"""" when they agree with you?  You're not """"discouraged from pointing out attacks or incivility,"""" you're discouraged from doing so in a pompous and arrogant manner which exacerbates rather than resolves.  As I said, if you had courteously suggested that I was out of line, you might have received a """"thanks for the reminder"""" from me.  In fact, despite your pompous attitude, I was nevertheless """"receptive"""" enough to offer the concession that some of my remarks could have been better phrased, but that wasn't good enough for you: no, you charged onto my Talk page to slap me down.  When I declined to cower, you went looking for bigger kids to beat me up, only to find that they were disinclined to do so.

 Some admin help 

Bish, can you take a look at . He seems to be a good faith editor but seems to have a not-any-good grasp of WP:RS and in particular WP:HISTRS and no amount of assistance seems to have had any impact. I'm uninvolved in the area but I have been trying to help him understand encyclopaedic contributions etc but haven't succeeded. He's had numerous nudges and informative bits and pieces of advice from editors in that topic area including Abecedare, Kautilya3, Ogress, JJ etc but I don't think the message has gone through. Rather than give you diffs, I'm linking User talk:Capankajsmilyo/Archive 1 where a lot of discussion rests. A lot more discussions have happened at various article talk pages and those could be found from the contribution history.

 Davey2010 

I just read WP:BATTLE and WP:AGF, and accordingly I find your message to Davey mentioning me in that context (while deliberately trying to hide it from me) as extremely upsetting. I have nothing personal against Davey (despite what he claims), I am certainly not trying to make him afraid or upset or otherwise miserable. If he tries to claim I am, I will vigorously defend myself against such lies. If anyone has been treated unfairly, it has been me by him - he reported me for being a VANDAL for crying out loud! I assume you know exactly how wrong that was (I sadly only properly realised that after the event). AGF says """"If criticism is needed, discuss editors' actions, but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence."""" Well, I have quite a lot of clear evidence now that Davey's lack of care in the subject area of buses/bus transport can only really be explained by him having a motive that is harmful to Wikipedia (to degrade the overall quantity and quality of its content on the subject). How else can you explain the phenomena of someone who claims to be a bus enthusiast and know a lot about buses, not having any clue how or why a list of trolleybus routes would be encyclopedic? Entire books have been written on just that subject! This is just one example. I have many more. If he had never claimed to know a lot about this subject, then yes, I could have assumed that this was just a case of amateurish but entirely innocent intent. But not any more. He clearly has a very specific idea about what Wikipedia should and should not contain on this subject, and it is quite clearly not explicitly supported by any of the rules. So, he is pushing the envelope far beyond the limits, and in some cases there's only one word to describe the things he says - pure lies. I'm sorry he's upset by the fact that I have the subject knowledge to be able to spot when he's not being truthful about certain things he says on this subject, and I'm sorry that he's upset that when he says something here breaks some rule or other, I actually take the time to check if that's true or not. But do not for a second confuse that with someone who is genuinely upset by someone stalking them or questioning their motives for no good reason. I could even go so far to say these might even be crocodile tears, since he doesn't appear to have been this sensitive over other issues where people are disagreeing with him - indeed he seems quite capable of telling people in no uncertain terms what he thinks of them. This is no shrinking violet, that's for sure.   """,0

 water fluoridation  

This opening sentence is misleading. Often, fluoridation is without the consent of the individual and is forced medication.
Controlled should be changed to mandated or required . . . medication of the water supply
fluoride is being used as a medication to enhance teeth health, controlled implies the person is knowingly adding fluoride to their water when in fact that is rarely the case. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.50.119.13 (talk)

 Metasemiotics 

As a journal editor myself, I often hear complaints from authors whose articles were rejected that """"the reviewer did not understand what we were writing"""". The answer is simple: this usually means that the article was not written intelligibly. I have nothing against metasemiotics, but an article that cannot be understood by the average reader will not be of much use to Wikipedia. Honestly, I could make head nor tail of that article. Material published in my own journal could not be placed in Wikipedia without heavy editing either. So my proposal for speedy deletion of your article is no reflection on the quality of the academic journals that you listed. It's just a reflection of the fact that you did not succeed in conveying what metasemiotics is about in generally understandable words. Apparently I was not the only one feeling this way, as the article was deleted by an admin who apparently agreed with me (I am not an admin and therefore cannot delete articles myself). In any case, it was only a speedy delete, so nothing prevents you from trying again. Please keep in mind in that case the public or which you are writing. Happy editing!   """,0

Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~""",0

"A sentence in the Social Issues section is rather misleading: it implies that opposition to the name change of the province comes from 'Non-Pashtun Hazara regions'. This is incorrect because  the majority of Hazara's population belong to various Pashtun tribes e.g. Yusufzai, Swati, Tanaoli, Jadun, Tahirkhelis etc. Even the Mashwanis and the Sayyids of Kaghan list themselves as Pashtuns despite being of Saadat origins. That a minority among these tribes speak Hindko does not imply a change of ethnicity. Although the section does reflect reality in that the region has been nefariously influenced by Punjab based politicians particularly the two factions of Pakistan Muslim League namely the Nawaz and Quaid leagues. Their internecine warfare in Punjab has over-spilled into Hazara and the Chaudry brothers of Quaid League have smelled an opening for their mischief against their nemesis the Sharif brothers who dropped their opposition and supported the name change.

I would disagree with whole """"how it is seen by the world"""" statement.  First of all, it will be seen by the world as it presents itself.  I really doubt after they stop using SUNY at Stony Brook, which they just have, that this name will last in anyones memory for long.  I would also point you to some less political references than those you put up, such as the wikipedia article for University at Buffalo, State University of New York.  They did the same thing a while back, and their website uses that designation.  Berkely is the same way.  It is technically UC Berkeley, but that isn't what you see on their website.

It would not be surprising that anything from SUNY head office or whatever it is would continue to use the old designation, but that is politics, and is hardly an area we need to play to here.  If they could stop Stony Brook from changing their name, they would.  No bureaucrat gives up power if they can prevent it.  It is a fait accompli.

You can't even write proper English. What college did you go to?  What's up, Doc?

 I think scientific skepticism is related to following the scientific method, not formal education h2g2bob (talk) 
For sure. The user 82.224.230.5 would likely know that. It's just trolling behavior.  What's up, Doc? 

I'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!
Oh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   
His IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. 
Back on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   

So according to you, it's enough to only """"suspect"""" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you """"suspect"""", how sure is that?! why didn't you even """"wonder"""", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don't you think ?!

I added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   

 Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)

If you are personally attacked, you should ask the attacker to stop and note this policy. If he or she continues, consider following the dispute resolution process. You might also consider removing particularly clear-cut personal attacks per the guideline WP:RPA; however, you should be very careful not to define """"personally attack"""" too broadly, or to do this too frequently. From a recent arbitration committee finding-of-fact:

The remove personal attacks guideline (and the application thereof) is controversial. It has often been abused by malefactors, and may not have community consensus. It should, at most, be interpreted strictly and used sparingly. [1] 
If you find yourself using this remedy frequently, you should reconsider your definition of """"personal attack."""" When in doubt, follow the dispute resolution process instead.

In extreme cases, an attacker may be blocked under the """"disruption"""" clause of the blocking policy, though the practice is almost always controversial. Personal attacks should be reported at WP:PAIN.

Are you sure people can still see the blue or green colours if they actually go on Urnaus and Neptune? What's up with these
. Ive ask the WP:RD, it's all  who is dowloading me those informations. I don't expect any sunlight to go to Uranus and Neptune, so the best term to say the sky is black. How you know Uranus and neptune is not that pitch-black-dark. On Mars I was learnt to not notice the orange color. I've ask the WP:RD, it's what SteveBaker said. I beleive and let's hope SB is doing a good job giving me accurate informations.69.228.145.50  
Greetings.  As I indicated in the edit summaries, some of your statements are totally incorrect; this casts doubt on the accuracy of your edits generally.  In several places you removed clear existing text and replaced it with confusing, even incoherent or unrelated statements.  Sub-standard English is a large part of the problem.  It might be best if you had someone check your grammar and spelling prior to editing articles, rather than work on Wikipedia alone.    

Please keep in mind that substantial changes should be sourced, regardless of who is giving you information.  Be careful not to add (or substitute) information that represents original research.  Also, you might want to read WP:FIVE as a basic introduction to Wikipedia policies.   

How you explain  and . You said my information I add to Uranus and Neptune is not right. The sunlight on Uranus and Neptune is like 50 to 100 feet away from candle, 400 and 900 times dimmer sunlight. O my god, that's alot . It's like total blackness a dark swirling mass is below my feet in orbit. That's like a candle light halfway down my high school campus. I hadn't found any information about uranus and Neptune's total blackness69.228.145.50  
I do not think you have read what I wrote above, or studied the policy pages I linked to.  If you intend to edit Wikipedia articles, be prepared to provide reliable sourcing, not information from the reference desk, or your own interpretations.  It is clear you are learning the fundamentals of astronomy for the first time.  I question whether you are ready to contribute constructively to a sophisticated scientific article at this time.  If you insist upon doing so, and go on in the same manner as before, your edits are almost certain to be reverted as unsourced original research or unclearly expressed.  I would advise you instead to postpone editing for now and learn as much as you can about the science, and also to concentrate on improving your command of English.   

Then how you know Jupiter's sunlight is 27 times fainter? That's what you fix by, then would that mean Jupiter is 27 times dimmer? Less sunlight, thne the planet is dimmer. Then reflect sunlight just like our rocky planets, they don't make their own light. Same thing as why nighttime on earth is always black, our ground is always black at night. You said the statement suppose to be source, then how you got those informations from?69.228.145.50  
It simply comes from the inverse square law.  The mean distance of Jupiter from the sun is  approx. 5.2 astronomical units, whose square is 27; a bit more accurate than 25 (based on 5 A.U.) Bear in mind that that is incident light.  The brightness of the planet also depends on its albedo, phase, etc.",0

I can't see women buying rape oil. Even if they know better, it sounds like an antisocial alternative to KY jelly. 

If I recall correctly, regular rape oil is a drying oil, mostly used industrially, perhaps in some specialty paints. It's toxic, but I don't know *how* toxic. (A lot of the foods we eat are toxic. Salt is a necessity, but a cup of salt would be lethal to half of all adults who ingest it.)

 Wikipedia: Index of Information, or Theological Authority? 
As far as I was concerned, Wikipedia is a place for information, not a place to assert beliefs. """"Maria is truly the Mother of God (De Fide). ...if Mary was not Mother of God, then Jesus was in fact not God."""" Really now! Is that a """"fact?"""" Or is that the authoritive Roman Catholic view? Since it is, that is how it should be stated: """"According to Roman Catholicism, Maria is thee mother of god,"""" as opposed to presenting this as """"fact."""" This is an encyclopedia, not a Roman Catholic mouthpiece. I don't adhere to Christianity or any religion for that matter, but I find this assertion absurd. Assuming for a moment, that there is actually a figure called """"god"""" and there was a personage named """"Mary/Maria,"""" and the """"Bible"""" is the ultimate authority, """"if Mary was not Mother of God, then Jesus was in fact not God"""" is an theologically anachronistic statement. If """"in the beginning, god created the heaven and earth,"""" and Mary came a long time afterwards, then we have a big problem, because if Mary is THEE mother of god, then god couldn't have been around to create Adam, Even and all the people leading up to Mary. If god existed before Mary, and Jesus was supposed to be god, than this would make Mary basically a surrogate womb with no connection to god whatsoever. I'm no Christian, but please.

Unfortunately, you are an undeniable feeble person who misrepresents reality of the Urantia Fellowship as someone who does not legitimately publish the Urantia Book and is a failure with only, as you say hundreds of members. The Urantia Readers-Intl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Korea, etc. Your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life. 

The Urantia Readers-Intl hosts world wide Internet meetings and has a monthly mailing list that encompasses 6 continents...  who still happens to host an annual get together in Florida for the prior members of the Urantia Association of Florida. The Urantia Book Fellowship is nothing more then a ban of radical beguiled readers who desire nothing more then to create a """"golden calf"""" of a an idolatrous Urantia church to appease their pagan animal nature. Anyone not self repressed enough to understand simple religious psychology can already see this in you.

Deep down inside you know this is true, but your subliminal self hatred keeps you in denial of such facts. And, as such we are going to ask that you...

No point of view in article titles is not a guideline.  In all cases, it is neutrality, and the NPOV POLICY, and the Naming conflict guideline that the policy summarizes all make it very clear that the existence of the ROC is not a consideration to deny that the most common usage of China is to mean the country we call People's Republic of China.
Wikipedia:NPOV#Article_naming Where proper nouns such as names are concerned, disputes may arise over whether a particular name should be used. Wikipedia takes a descriptive rather than prescriptive approach in such cases, describing corporate entities such as cities and states by the names by which they describe themselves (or by the English-language equivalent). Where inanimate entities such as geographical features are concerned, the most common name used in English-language publications is generally used. See Wikipedia:Naming conflict for further guidance.
The followup guideline, Naming conflicts, entirely disagrees with you.  The common name (in use by the world), the self-descriptive name (of the PRC), the official short name (ie, the UN) of the PRC is simply, """"China"""".  The guideline says that subjective criteria such as someone else's claim to the term China (ie, the ROC), should NOT be used as criteria to determine Wikipedia's usage.  """,0

All is done through, and by, your article by hiding the truth, and giving only half the story that does not stay in the intent and purpose of the article, i.e. to fully inform the public of the versions of Firefox)this then would be the example I write in your article that it is crap, bogus. that people should not read it.

These people cannot afford computer tech to service their computers, they have to """"rely on the kindness of strangers"""", such as volunteers such as myself. Some do not have a network of tech volunteers, so your article causes them suffering by hiding the truth from them (by removal of any information that shows the serious flaws of those versions so that it is never seen and the people are not informed), and by not having the money, or the means to correct it, and taking what little pleasure and escape from them. For this act the courts should pass the harshest and heaviest sentence possible on you, and others like you. I hope in the near future that not only that you are arrested, tried, and imprisoned, but you are sued and lose everything you have, everything you have striven for, and everything you have dreamed about.

Contested deletion

This article should not be speedily deleted for lack of asserted importance because... I am still learning how to add information to the profile, including accomplishments,press releases, etc. I wanted to start the page and continue to add to it. A note should be made regarding timeliness. Specifically, should a list of referenced accomplishments be aged? Should an activity occurred more than one year or more ago? The lack of specificity creates ambiguity especially as it relates to other businesses, sites, people, etc. who would like to be included in wikipedia if for no other reason than posterity's sake.

This was deleted because of advertising, but to answer your questions, press releases are not useful to show notability as they are not independent references, but they could be used to support facts in a page if you believe them to be true.

 I also inserted comments between the two pinout tables explaning that there may be situations where the """"older"""" style may be preferable - and that some equipment can be fussy about which pairs are crossed, and which are not.
 I broke out the """"Cable Pinouts"""" and """"Other Technologies into separate sections to make things clearer.

I didn't write the sentence about the biblical references, I merely supplied them. I don't remember who  wrote the sentence.  However, a federal circuit court, wrote, (one of my deleted references):

The following was excerpted from Iannaccone v. Law, 142 F.3d 553 (2d Cir. 1998):

The right to proceed pro se in civil actions in federal courts is guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. § 1654, which provides: """"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" Section 1654's guarantee derives directly from the Judiciary Act of 1789.

First introduced in the Senate on June 12, 1789 as part of Senate Bill [S-1], the right to self-representation appeared in section 31 of the Bill. But when the Bill became law, on September 24, 1789, the right was moved to section 35, which reads as follows: """"That in all the Courts of the United States the Parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of such Counsel or Attornies at law as by the rules of the said Courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" V Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of America 1789-1791 1150, 1165, 1193 (1986). As can be seen, the right to self-representation has remained constant for over 200 years.

The framers of our Constitution thought self-representation in civil suits was a basic right that belongs to a free people. Although the Supreme Court alluded to civil pro se representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 812-13 (1975), the Court there focused its discussion on the right to represent oneself as a defendant in a criminal case, id. at 813 et seq., which the Constitution's Bill of Rights guarantees.

In a criminal prosecution, a pro se party of course may only appear as a defendant. In a civil case, a person may appear pro se as either a plaintiff or defendant. And, as noted, the right of self-representation in one case is protected by the Constitution, and in the other, simply by statute. Further, in contrast to criminal defendants, civil litigants unable to afford counsel cannot ordinarily obtain appointment of counsel, except in circumstances when there is a risk of loss of liberty, as in mental commitment or juvenile delinquency proceedings. See H.B. Kim,Legal Education For the Pro Se Litigant: A Step Towards a Meaningful Right to Be Heard, 96 Yale L. J. 1641, 1646-47 (1987).

Moreover, the historical origins of self-representation in civil and criminal proceedings are different. In Faretta, the Court discussed the historic requirement of having counsel, going back to the infamous English Star Chamber that forced counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding, and the requirement's gradual reform. This reform was fervently embraced in colonial America for those accused of crime. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 821-26.

Passing from the criminal to the civil context, we . . . observ[e] that a person appearing pro se in federal court can be a mixed blessing because persons appearing pro se lack legal training and may, on occasion, burden the court by filing illogical or incomprehensible pleadings, affidavits and briefs. And sometimes a pro se litigant appears simply for the purpose of using the courtroom to advance a political or social agenda, or to pursue a matter that is legally unredressable. See E.J.R. Nichols, Preserving Pro Se Representation in an Age of Rule 11 Sanctions, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 351, 351 nn.2 & 3 (1988). Yet, even given those potential burdens, there still remains a citizen's right of access to the courts, a strongly held notion stretching back to the beginnings of our Republic. The origins of the right to appear for oneself in civil proceedings derive from a number of sources, all deeply rooted in our history and culture. We undertake to discuss briefly five of those sources, though doubtless there are others:

First, history. Under the English common law with its complicated forms of action and veritable maze of writs and confusing procedures, the right to retain counsel in civil proceedings became a necessity. By the middle of the thirteenth century, lawyers so monopolized the courts in London that the King was forced to decree that, except for a few special causes, litigants were entitled to plead their own cases without lawyers. See The Right to Counsel in Civil Litigation, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 1322, 1325 (1966).

Second, mistrust of lawyers made appearance in court without benefit of counsel the preferred course. See A.L. Downey, Note, Fools and Their Ethics: The Professional Responsibility of Pro Se Attorneys, 34 B.C. L. Rev. 529, 533 (1993). Lawyers had no position of honor or place in society in early colonial days. The pioneers who cleared th",0

I was trying to provide a chance to fix the problem because I thought something would be done about the quality, but it appears that this is not going to happen any time soon. It does not take three weeks to acquire sources for this type of basic topic, and even if it does, I don't see why you would remove the tags, since they could incite others to fix the article and inform readers that they should be wary about the facts stated here. I don't understand what would possess you to try to sweep this under the rug. Keep in mind that you still don't own the article.

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

 Not sure what you are getting at here or the point your at attempting to make. (???) Hand loaders/ reloaders do not look at SAAMI/CIP when they create their own ammunition.  While I do not speak German, I can read and comprehend articles. Note I have in the past used German articles as references... if that is what you mean. I am still working on the article and remains incomplete. However, one does not look at an individual's reloaded data and give it credence from a Wikipedia standpoint. Factory manufactured ammunition should only be listed for illustrative purposes and for good reason, they respect a standard which is safe in a vast majority of caliber specific firearms. Conversely, if no standard is maintained for a given cartridge then data from reloading manuals should suffice. I am well aware that .325 WSM components are available in Europe, a cursory check on component sellers websites evidence this. BGO... However, I am certain that those reloading are not dragging pressure measuring instrumentation and pressure testing their ammunition against SAAMI or CIP standards.  Not sure what is being alluded to in the S&B; """"looks like... FMJ"""" but they do not manufacture 325 WSM ammo. 
 It is certain that the 325 WSM will become another also ran cartridge.  Certainly, rifle trends show that much. This was an 8mm cartridge designed from the US and Canadian markets and was a commercial flop from the beginning. But what does that have to do with anything in the end, really.  It is still a cartridge and should be treated in an objective manner on the Wiki - just like any other article. Yes the 8mm IS is established in Europe, and the 8mm RWS much less so but is hanging on, the 8 Rem Mag is dead and almost buried and .325 has both feet firmly planted in the the grave. So what...

Adult Film Career Revision Proposal

This paragraph needs editing.  It has several problems

 Moving to Germany had nothing to do with Adult films.
 This sentence is superflous:  """"Other films included Man to Men and Jawbreaker.""""
 This sentence seems to be selling the films or gratuitously promoting them. """"Scenes from some films have been re-released as part of compilations which is common in the porn industry. The compilation Touched by an Anal was released in 1997; a more recent release was in 2006, Mansex Meltdown.""""
 This sentence has nothing to do with the Adult Film Career heading: """"Though he has appeared in gay and bisexual porn films, Sanchez identifies as heterosexual and has stated that he has had no homosexual contact since joining the Corps in 2003.""""

Re-write for Adult Career 2.0

So, we could re-write:

In the early 1990's, Matt Sanchez lived in Montreal, Canada where he worked in the adult entertainment industry in all-male films for prominent directors John Rutherford and Kristen Bjorn and Chi Chi Larue at the studios Bijou, Catalina and Falcon Video.  For French-speaking films, he used the stage name Pierre LaBranche, but all of his titles in the United States were under Rod Majors.   

During his career, Sanchez stared in several award-winning adult films including Call of the Wild, Jawbreaker and Idol Country co-starring Ryan Idol and Marco Rossi. 

Scenes from many films have recently been re-released as part of compilations; Sanchez stated in an interview with Radar Magazine that it """"was just the nature of the business, you shoot a lot of films and they use them forever."""" Sanchez later wrote, """"In porn, everything taboo is trivialized and everything trivial is magnified.""""

I am not removing legitimate sources, I am removing information that has no relevance to the article. One could say the statement - House music started in Chicago. Then give a viable source. This is true yes, but it is not relevant to the article, that is what I'm getting at. Your reference to a couple of records that provided some 'missing link' may be more relevant on a page on disco. Carl Craigs opinions on the word progressive are relevant and should be included, but this page is really about Progressive House, I think you would agree...that's why I removed the statements about Techno. If you don't understand what I'm referring to, then I don't think you are qualified to be hacking away at other peoples work that isn't incorrect in the first place. I also find it strange that you keep monitoring this page. Every edit I do, it's like your watching my every move. Do you think this is healthy? I've gone away for a month. Let's see how long it takes for you to come back.

Since I suspect you weren't part of the original Progressive movement, I think you should leave the edits standing to give people a chance to comment, instead of hacking away at whatever I write. Another question I have, were you at the Renaissance events at the time the Sasha & Digweed mix CD was released? The word Progressive has everything to do with House music that was played at events such as Renaissance.

Your reference to the gap being filled by MBO & Capricorn, then the beginning of Techno, is false. Chicago House was the big scene in the midwest and this is the influence (and the gap) that the Detroit guys were using to design their version of House music. Larry Heard had everything to do with what Detroit was up to. Experimental type Techno obviously deserves a place in the history, but as far as dance records, It was modelled hugely after what Ron Hardy was playing in the Music Box. The output of labels such as Trax, DJ International, and Jack Trax was monstrous in comparison to the small industrial wasteland scene of Detroit at the time, along with it the labels that were releasing """"Techno"""" - Metroplex, KMS etc. This large volume of output in Chicago is what was filling the gap.

 Ambedkar's response to the Poona Pact

On the one hand I had to save the life of Mr. Gandhi; on the other, I had to protect the legitimate rights of millions of my fellow untouchable brothers with the full value of my life. I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact. If my Upper Caste brothers wholeheartedly accept and try to implement this pact, then I and my untouchable brothers would be very happy. On this occasion I do not hesitate to give credit to Sir Tejbahadur Sapru and C. Rajgopalachari besides Mahatma Gandhi for the success of this Pact.""""

Republics
Need your help and/or advice.  The British Wikipedian Republican Party sought fit to delete Wikinfo:Classical definition of republic from Wikipedia.  There is a terrible brouhaha at Talk:Republic. They won't even allow an external link! SimonP really doesn't know what he is doing.  They deleted the Classical definition of republic and created mixed government and politeia instead.  The official title of mixed government is a Republic and the Romans translated """"politiea"""" as Republic.  And then to top it off the new article Classical republicanism doesn't refer to the Classical republics of Crete, Sparta, Solonic Athens, or Rome but to Machiavelli's ideology.  How can that be when Venice in the 13th century instituted a mixed government and called herself a """"Republic"""".  

With Jwrosenwieg and Kim Bruning there was a tacit agreement a year ago to have republic be the modern meaning and a [Classical definition of republic] to describe the ancient republics of Hellas and Rome and their influence.  To say the least the """"Republic section"""" is all messed up. We need some clarification.  I have new information but User:Snowspinner won't let me bring this back up for undelete.

 Some historical references to the story of the Janjua Rajputs / sitush stop fucking with our article you gay hindu  

'Some historical references to the story of the Janjua Rajputs...'Bold text.
Predating all that is related below, the Pandava ancestors of Janjuas were known historically for the great Mahabharata war in which Arjuna and his brothers were victorious after huge losses on both sides.

""""The Janjua Rajputs possess a proud Martial reputation and rank very highly as the aristocracy of the Salt Range. Their pride in their ancestry is renowned and are always addressed by their ancestral title of Raja."""" (Rawalpindi District Gazetteer Robertson, reprint 2001, Lahore, p105)

""""Their (Janjuas) exploits and reputation has earned them the regard as the most Valiant Kshatriyas (warlords) in the Punjab."""" (History of Mediaeval Hindu India by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, Cosmo Publ. 1979, p129) """"The tribal system of loyalty to the clan is still adhered, and they tend to only align with other tribes of equally high social rank and reputation."""" (The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia Gyanes Kudaisya, London 2000, p207) “The great Janjua tribe have retained their pride of lineage and their Rájput title, and can be ranked as Míán Sáhu or first class Rájpúts...physically well-looking, with fine hands and feet; much given to military service, especially in the cavalry;...poor agriculturists, with great pride of race and are always addressed as Raja” (Panjab Castes - Sir Denzil Ibbetson, reprint Delhi 2002, p149, p154)
""""The Janjua are famed as a restless and warlike Muslim Rājput tribe."""" (Imperial Gazetteer of Kashmir and Jammu, Sang e Meel, reprint 2002, p9, p34) and are """"doubtless pure Rājputs"""".(Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p152) & (The Indian Village Community by Baden Henry Baden-Powell, Adamant Media Corp. 2005, p97) The Janjuas Rajputs have been recognised in Punjabi history as a 'Martial clan' and the British also viewed them as excellent soldiers and distinguished them from other tribes as""""other tribes no way superior to them in courage or military skill"""". ('Punjab Chiefs' L.H.Griffin, 1909 Lahore, p215-7}. .
The ancestors of the Janjuas Rajputs , the last dynasty of the Janjua Shahis, were mentioned by Albiruni..""""as noble men of noble bearings...who always did what they said"""". Al-Biruni, despite living under Sultan Mahmud's grace, praises the house of Jayapala Janjua (10th Century AD): """"We must say that in all their grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of doing that which is good and right, that they were men of noble sentiment and noble bearing."""" Kalhana (13th Century AD) writes of the Janjua Shahis: """"Where is the Shahi dynasty with its ministers, its kings, and its great grandeur? ... The very name of the splendor of Shahi kings has vanished. What is not seen in dream, what even our imagination cannot conceive, that dynasty accomplished with ease"""".

The Tarikh-e-Alfi of the Ghorids (13th Century AD) mentions the rebellious behaviour of [1]Raja (Ajmal) Mal (est. d. 1230 AD) (son of Raja Dhrupat Dev of Mathura) towards the Delhi Sultanate. It records that a """"Rai Mal"""" of the mountains between Lahore and Kabul excited a rebellion against them and intercepted communications between Lahore and Ghazni. There is still today remnants of an ancient fort in Malot, Chakwal which was initially built by the Shahis and later rebuilt by Raja Mal Janjua. It is also inscribed that the last Hindu Shahi emperor Raja Mal embraced Islam at this place. Raja Mal was also the first ruler to begin the mining of salt in the Salt Ranges of Kallar Kahar and in the Khewra Salt Mines of Punjab which is currently the world's second largest salt mine. Many prominent Muslim tribes of Potohar Plateau in Pakistan trace their lineage back to the Janjuas through the five princes of the House of Raja Mal Janjua (13th Century AD). The five princes were: Raja Bhir Raja Jodh (est. d. 1259 AD) (ancestor of Chakri/Bajwala / Darapur Janjuas) Raja Kala Raja Tanoli Raja Khakha Jodh and Bhir were born of a Gakhar Rani while Kala, Khakha and Tanoli were born of another Rajput Rani. ('Journal of Central Asia', Vol.XIII, no.1, 1990 p79). According to Lepel H. Griffin, in his famous book Chiefs and Families of note in the Punjab (Lahore, 1910, ii, p254) he writes that Raja Jodh and Raja Wir/Bhir (oldest sons of Rai Mal), """"divided the country, the Maloki Dhan, between them. Jodh took the Salt Range near about the Makrach and captured the town of Makshala from a colony of Brahmans...He changed its name to Makhiala and built there a fort and two tanks for rain water. Wir (also spelt Bhir), the eldest son of Raja Mal, took the possession of Kura (also spelt Khewra) near modern Pind Dadan Khan...""""

"""

There are three things to point out about this discussion:
1. The """"material"""" concept of time. Time here is not intended as an abstract entity, a chronological coordinate, as we are used to.  A """"time"""" is the complex of all existing beings, things, circumstances and processes occurring in a particular historical instant. So it 's like an enormous set including everything existing or going on at that moment. If you consider the next instant, another enormous set is determined and that 's different form the previous one, as many things or situations have been changed. So we are included in the times because we are among the countless things and beings """"contained"""" in the flowing times.

2. Sorry Memoro, but I must notice that your feeling of a possible deponent behaviour of the verb """"muto"""" is baseless and factually incorrect.
Indeed, consulting several Latin grammars and dictionaries I found no trace, no hint of a use of """"muto"""" as a deponent or semi-deponent verb, at least in the classics. Simply, when a verb is provided with both forms, active and passive, it cannot be a deponent.
It is however true that """"mutare"""", as well as """"to change"""" in English, may have a transitive or intransitive meaning. When it is transitive there is someone who performs changing and someone who undergoes it; so we can use the active or passive form to determine who 's the agent. We can say  """"I change you"""" or """"I am changed by you"""", leaving no doubt on who 's the author and who the object of changing. In the second case (the passive one) it 's wholly evident that change is not due to my will.
With the intransitive meaning instead, the concept of voluntariness of change remains more shaded and vague. When I say: """"I change"""", I make quite clear that some changing is affecting myself, but nothing is said about whether this change is due to my will or to the events, circumstances or somebody else 's will. Thus, using the active form with intransitive meaning, we can leave an open door to both possibilities:  - a. I am changing because I actually want to, or - b. I am forced to change by circumstances or others.
Therefore, whoever was the author of this maxim, he had a simple way to let us think that we might be the artificers of our own change. He only had to write the verb in its active form: """"mutamus"""". A simple """"s"""" instead of an """"r"""". That wouldn 't even afffect the hexameter 's rhythm. But he (purposedly in my opinion) chose the passive form; so expressly underlining our """"passivity to the change"""".
Moreover, he used a special trick to give an even stronger emphasis to the passivity. Normally speaking in Latin, one would say """"et nos mutamur""""; but here we see """"nos et mutamur"""". Exchanging the pronoun with the conjunction is a rare expedient to emphasize the latter (in Latin language, everything that comes """"after"""" has higher importance in a sentence 's  context). This special exchange serves to point out that this """"nos et"""" is not a simple """"et nos""""; we should translate it as """"and we too""""; but other stronger translations could be: """"and we forcedly"""", """"and we ineluctably"""", """"and we a fortiori"""". 
All this drives me to the conclusion that the sentence 's author wanted to stress as much strongly as possible that we are """"passive"""" poor things in front of the general changing going on through the entire universe. So the true extensive meaning of the phrase is:
""""When everything existing in the universe is subject to change by circumstances and force majeure; how could we, poor little human things, pretend not being changed as well?""""
This way of reasoning comes quite natural if you """"think in Latin"""".

3. According to the ancient and medieval way of thinking, this sentence is nothing else than an Aristotelian categorical syllogism; i.e. the basic unit of logical reasoning.
Here we have:
- a major premise: """"Tempora mutantur""""
- a minor premise: """"in illis"""" saying that we humans are included in times 
- a conclusion: """"nos et mutamur"""".
That simply means we are forced to change because we are part of all things that are changed.
In mathematical logic and set theory, these relations concern set inclusion. So here are: 
a set H containing all humans; a set T containing all times (as defined above) and an even bigger set C containg all things, beings, situations, processes, and complexes af all them, that are subject to changing.
The minor premise states that H is included in T, the major premise says T is included in C and the conclusion is H is included in C.
In other words this is what 's usually defined as """"the transitive property of inclusion"""". Thus, a synthetic translation of our sentence in sheer mathematical terms is:   H ⊂ T, T ⊂ C   ⇒  H ⊂ C""",0
"Moving details below
I think the details regarding the official reason provided by Israel from banning him from Israel should be moved to the section below, per WP:UNDUE.

I have no problem with including the fact that Israel says the reason was contact with Hamas leaders below (which is hardly considered a very strong or sensational accusation, as they are the governing party there and considering the fact that Norwegian conservative politicians also have meetings with Hamas, and having contact with Hamas is hardly considered any more controversial than meeting their Israeli counterparts in the Israeli government).",0
""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about",0

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

I'm only answering this because I'm really bored, excruciatingly so, and I also find it kind of amusing. People writing and, or, approving of psychologically harmful disinformation, that starving girls read, including the expressed desire to include a potentially triggering image of such a starving girl, illicits no response whatsoever. A collapsible box however, seems to be somehow construed as a threat to  civilization. One inane comment after another becomes somewhat irritating. 
Despite only having a ninth grade education, I actually did learn how to read. I also learned the proper use of Latin phrases, e.g.; id est (i.e) and exempli gratia (e.g.). For example, or to use an abbreviation of a Latin phrase, e.g.; ...in article text, i.e., how they were recently used here. Should have been e.g., not, i.e.. That being said, I read this:  
MOS:COLLAPSE:Scrolling lists and boxes that toggle text display between hide and show are acceptable for use, but should not be used in article prose.  This includes reference lists, image galleries, and image captions; Collapsible sections are useful in ,infoboxes, or to consolidate information already covered in prose.

This is not prose:
Candidate genes include dopamine transporter, dopamine receptors D2/D3,[46] dopamine beta-hydroxylase monoamine oxidase A, catecholamine-methyl transferase, serotonin transporter promoter (SLC6A4), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2A), 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B receptor (5-HT1B),[47] the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,[48] the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,[48] and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).[49]

 List of products in The Simpsons 

Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:
Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as """"Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Bulk groups of products like the """"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Do not include real-world products like """"English Muffins"""". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.
The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.

The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:
Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added """"Radioactive Man Comics"""", """"The Springfield Shopper"""" and """"Li'l Bastard Kits"""". These are great ones, but things like """"Disemboweller IV"""" needn't be included.

I am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above (real-world items and bulk groups) but I'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items, but I suggest you join a discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons#List of products in The Simpsons.

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

First he claims the Soviet had preplanned its withdraw from the front, but Finnish sources who is supported by POW interview, intellegnce data and Otho Manninen extended archives research in SOviet/Russian archives have pinpointed exactlly witch Soviet units where pressent in the battle and when they left.

What we now for certaint is: The composistion of the Soviet major combat formations where pressent, they Soviet was reinforced by 100 tanks and SPG before the battle, and during the battle 21 Soviet army sent more of its formation in to the battle. 

This contradics any statment of withdraw to other fronts or the redicules low figure as only 60000 Soviet red army men.

What about Tbma sources?

The Sources of 60000 men from """"Punaiset panssarit - Puna-armeijan panssarijoukot 1918-1945"""" is by no mean to be seen as a final statment over the battle as the book is abour red army tank, and just uses a few phrases on the Tali-Ihantala battle.

"""The Green Fairway Estates is an Alexander Construction Company housing development in Palm Springs, California.

Designed and constructed in the mid-century modern style of the period, the Green Fairway Estates tract is perched on the edge of Tahquitz Golf Course in the southern part of the city. The fairway homes begin near the corner of Lakeside Drive and Brentwood and snake their way down the street continuing on to a portion of Pebble Beach. Each home was built according one of nine master floor plans, each theme being repeated only two or three times due to the limited number of homes that were constructed prior to 1965  the year that the Alexanders died in a plane crash. Fortunately for the development, however, a number of Green Fairway Estates were completed prior to or soon after this terrible accident.

The Green Fairway Estates are in many ways the """"Brigadoon"""" Alexanders of Palm Springs, as very few people  even die-hard modernists  know about the neighborhood. Many of the Green Fairway homes are executed in an Asiatic or South Pacific style, influenced no doubt by the sense of Eastern exoticism being brought home by World War II soldiers. Construction features include A-frame roofs, lava rock facades, Aztec motifs, and other """"exotic"""" features. With floorplan names like The Royal Singapore and The Maracaibo, the whimsical ideals and themes of the period are in full force. 

The architect responsible for these models was architect Donald Wexler  architect of the Palm Springs International Airport and the now famous North End steel homes. The area surrounding the tract was originally surveyed and developed by the Westview Development Company in 1958.

"Tom, I'm a novice at this, and am just now figuring out how to use my Talk page.  Yes, my view is that Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford and other royal wards.  In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.

The USA under the Confederation may have had the same name as the modern-day USA, but it was not the modern-day USA. The USA (Confederation) and the USA (Union, or also called """"nation""""), are different entities. The argument can be made that while the USA (Confederacy) was a """"firm league of friendship"""" among a number of """"free and independent states,"""" the USA (Union) was a separate political entity that, although it replaced the USA league, was something completely different. Saying that the Articles was the first constitution of the USA, and then providing a link to the (modern-day) United States, is misleading. My point: The article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the Articles was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist, although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name.

And the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.

 Aztec society 

Gidday Richard, I note that you've swapped some text about between Aztec society and Daily life in the Aztec Empire articles. I think it's fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics, however I have some reservations about the latter of these two articles. It was one of a brace of Aztec and Maya articles (see for eg Mayan Trade, Mayan Food) all created around the same time in September by about 4 or 5 first-time editors, and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area. I'm not saying that there's copyvio involved here, my guess would be that it's almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles. They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them. They need considerable work and rearranging, and in some instances I really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main Aztec/Maya articles.

Just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles. The images which came with the Daily Life article are also I believe mis-tagged as the contributor's own work, when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere. Anyways, keep up the good work, and cheers  | TALK """,0

 The majority of economists do not follow Cagan´s 1956 definition of hyperinflation being 50% inflation per month for 12 months.  

I propose to remove the following sentence from the Definition sub-paragraph in the article: """"Economists usually follow Cagan’s description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%."""" or replace it with: A handful of economists still follow Cagan´s descpription that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%. 

The generally accepted definition regarding hyperinflation is the IASB´s definition, namely, 100% cumulative inflation over three years. It is the definition followed by all accountants worldwide and by the far greater majority of economists. Only a small handful of economists follow Cagan´s definition. No government follows Cagan´s definition: thus, it is a fact that no macroeconomist advising any government follows Cagan´s definition.

It is completely misleading to present Cagan´s definition as the generally accepted definition of hyperinflation by economists in general. That is a completely false suggestion. 195.23.41.216  """,0

I think Daqu is exactly right - and if not, could somebody please explain why not?

That is, why not say:
""""An involution is an element of order 2.  A Coxeter group is any group generated by finitely many involutions.""""??

If true, that lets somebody know exactly what a Coxeter group is without knowing what the word """"presentation"""" means, or (worse) having to know or accept on faith any theorems about presentations.

Then the stuff about m_ij and so on could be presented as consequences of the definition.  And those who know about presentations could then say """"Ah, yes, and in fact the class of Coxeter groups can be defined via presentations"""".

I think in general definitions should involve just as little apparatus as possible, and only involve extra machinery when that significantly shortens and simplifies what is being defined.

An easier definition should never depend on a harder definition.

Of course, if i'm wrong and this is not what a Coxeter group is, somebody please explain and give a counterexample, and thanks in advance.

You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase.

Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.

 crosstheTs is back 

Futper, as promised, I've been working on a precise report on your editing habits (and have assembled a long record of diffs that seem to show you almost without fail push FYROM positions (highly improbable if you had a NPOV on the issue) I have also been reading up on Wikipedia's Administrator_Code_of_Conduct.

""""Admins are entrusted with additional abilities, but do not have special rights beyond those of regular editors. Like everybody else, admins are expected to behave in a civil manner.

Admins should also be aware that warning a user of a block, especially when the user has no prior history of problems, can be perceived as a threat. When dealing with otherwise good contributors, it may be advisable to make suggestions to their behavior without mentioning a block.

Reflecting on those words... I don't believe some of your intial words to me (which included ad hominem attacks me and threats to block me remotely match those standards).

""""Every sane person with normal adult intelligence can see that your allegations against B.F. are nonsensical. If you can't see that yourself, it's probably no use me trying to explain it to you. I will simply block you if you continue with this topic, for being either a malicious troll or too clueless for rational discussion""""

Also... I don't believe it was appropriate after I had made the initial anon complaint about you for you to block me (if you felt it was necessary it should have been left in the hands of another admin). The Wikipedia admin code of conduct clearly states this about admin conflicts of interests.

""""An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest""""

The reason why I'm asking is because I realize we both have strong POV on FYROM issues and that we got off on the wrong foot because of it. While I am preparing to push forward with a precisely itemized complaint against you (which I believe clearly shows inappropriate behavior towards me) I really don't want to go about this the long nasty way (which was why as a newb my complaint was anon until Beam started to unilaterally campaign to block me and reveal details) 

I would much prefer to save both our time by letting the matter drop but that would require your participation and assurance you will never again try to leverage your admin status as a tool to personally threaten me again. (surely others admins can handle it if it seems very necessarily to them) 

So what I really am asking here is are you willing to press the polite reset button and just stick to arguing points?   """,0

 Hi Nabeelsahab, thanks for the note. There are a number of problems with your edit on Zad al-Ma'ad. Firstly, the content you added seems to have been copied and pasted from http://www.kalamullah.com/zaad-al-maad.html. The text is therefore copyrighted material and should be removed. Please see Wikipedia:Copy-paste.

Secondly, Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view based on reliable secondary sources. Websites such as kalamullah.com are not considered reliable due to there polemic and sectarian nature. Neutral sources include media agencies such as the BBC or academic sources. Please read WP:RS. There are a number of academic sources on Ibn Qayyim such as the works of Livnat Holtzman and Jon Hoover which you should consider looking into that might provide reliable and accurate information about Zad al-Ma'ad.

Thirdly, the language of the article needs to be Encyclopedic. Claims such as """"This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah.."""" seems to be an example of puffery. Please read  WP:PUFF.

Fourthly, adding statements such as """"Available from Australian Islamic Library website"""" seems to be a clear case of WP:PROMOTION. Zad al-Ma'ad is available in a whole series of websites such as http://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Complete_Zaad_al_Maad.pdf, http://idci.co.uk/Provisions-For-The-Hereafter-Mukhtasar-Zad-Al-maad-699-d etc.... so there is no need to specify the Australian Islamic Library in particular.

""":: This suggestion can wait to try out once the basics are done but I was wondering about perhaps making a """"Community Relations"""" sub topic? In that I think Bread and Life can be incorporated and also the expansion issue that currently is in the 'controversy' section. Furthermore the university seems to have some sort of business relationship with the surrounding local businesses that could be incorporated as well.

"Sure! Both for you adapting it to the German Wikipedia and for me adding DM and Euro it. In fact, adding a new currency is pretty easy, although I think I'll change the structure so that individual currencies are stored in individual pages, for an easier maintenance.

But first tell me: do these numbers take into account the change in currency, so that values in DM get automatically converted to Euros if I simply go multiplying year after year? Or will an input in DM also output in DM? Because I think the best thing is for currencies to not be converted, requiring the user to do a conversion by hand, as it would be quite difficult to keep track of which currency was valid for which year.

Also, could you please provide me a list for Euro-only inflations? If I'm going to add the older DM, it's fair I also add the Euro itself in the same move. -)

I've seen listings here on Wikipedia that have had the same tags for years, and nothing more ever happened.

Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts

By repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St. Martin's Press (New York), """"Feeling Your Pain,"""" as a source of chapter-long damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps, LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers.

That St. Martin's Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist.  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.

(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,""""Feeling Your Pain,"""" (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, """"has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission."""")

As is now clear, """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.

So to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his """"editing"""" of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.

When I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin's Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.

Someone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.

That his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.

So I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. """"No information is better than misleading information,"""" as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.

I am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.

I have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)

I don't maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other's work has no place. I have labeled some posts """"suggested edits.""""  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.

But LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  

I left LoverofArt's Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.  That is the mark of responsible editing.

Dbiel, I respect your knowledge of the Wikipedia way of doing",0
"""
the or The? (re-stated proposal)
It seems that there is some confusion as to what is being proposed, with some editors believing the statement “the band’s name is The Beatles” to be a counter-argument to the proposal (in fact, the statement is a premise of the proposal), so I’ll try to re-present the argument more clearly.

Premises:
The band’s name is The Beatles.
The band’s name is not subject to any unusual capitalisation rules. (Were it otherwise, there would be WP:RSs commenting on the fact).
The band’s name is used in Wikipedia music articles.
MOS:MUSIC is “the Manual of Style, a style guide, for Wikipedia music articles”.
MOS:MUSIC#Names (definite article) instructs that, for band names starting with the definite article, “Mid-sentence, per the MoS, the word """"the"""" should in general not be capitalized” (and provides for exception, only on a usage basis, not a band basis).

Conclusion:
When the name The Beatles is used in Wikipedia music articles, the word the should not be capitalized mid sentence (excepting the specific constructs detailed in MOS:MUSIC).

Proposal:
Follow the MOS (per the above conclusion).

Notes:
The benefit in accepting the proposal is, per the MOS, more “consistent usage and formatting”, throughout music articles and Wikipedia as a whole.
Per WP:CCC, “editors need to re-examine each proposal on its own merits”, not “on what influenced a past consensus”.

 A violation of wiki rules 

Apparantley I have made a mistake called WP:OUTING in regards to sockpuppet user 86.40.192.203 whom had begun a discussion on the admin board against me with false charges. this sockpuppet had done this previously saying he was not a sock - yet again he oppened a second admin section against me with a new sock saying that he was someone different yet he was clearly the same guy (lying and saying he was a new editor)

i say in no uncertain terms that i had never heard of WP:OUTING and am sorry if i have violated this policy - but i should also say that all the information i posted i got from his own prior vandalism - essentially he outed himself - he vandalized a page to give his name and date of birth - which got reverted by another editor because it had nothing to do with the article he was vandalizing - his location i got from the wiki's own traceroute function that i thought we were allowed to use to prove sockpuppetrty68.231.15.56  

in one of his sockpuppet attacks here Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User talk:68.231.15.56 he states that """"This person has only recently been reported."""" this sentence implies that SOMEONEELSE reported me and yet the IP of the previous reporter is 86.40.107.69 which traces to the same location in Ireland - this is by definition sockpuppetry or the use of various IP's to do malicious intent without acknowledement of ownership68.231.15.56  
myself i have used this same IP for over 5,000 edits whereas i can see a pattern of daily vandalism and sockpuppetry of the 86.40 IP as far back as 2008 (man thats a lot of vandalism) endlessly ANON changing his IP to avoid block which i am betting he is already long ago blocked administratively68.231.15.56

No, not at all. I moved the request to the talk page of the administrator who added the protection back in 2011, so I hope he will get round to it sooner or later. Thanks, 679

BTW, it is true that there are some copies that don't feature the green format logo on there, but it it also true that some copies actually had the green format logo. I have seen both those copies before, which both do not feature the BV logo.

5. A couple of my friends have """"Cool Runnings"""", they have the previews I mentioned on there, it is real and a later printing, I thought that needed to be added on there.

6. I didn't know that """"The Sword in the Stone"""" was sold in a black clamshell case, I thought it was sold in white because every case is in white. I could be wrong, but I say the version in black clamshell is the March 1986 edition, the one in white clamshell is from May 1986, the version that doesn't feature the trailer is from June 1986, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out October 1986, the version with a different tape label is from January 1987, and finally, the version where the cover doesn't have the VHS words means it came out February 1988.

7. I think the version where it has previews came out May 1986, the version with no previews and FBI warnings fading came out October 1986 because it was still in progression of editing, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out December 1986 because DSAS: vol.2 came out that day, meaning that version with the red FBI warnings and the VDA came out January 1987.

"This passage was removed

 It allows opposition leaders not only to avoid authorities pressure themselves, but also to protect their supporters by direct interference in arrests, searches etc. E.g., during the 2001 UBK campaign, the deputies were trying to prevent the mass groundless arrests of youth in Kyiv by breaking into militsiya precincts and vehicles.

I agree it's rather specific, but it does colourfully illustrate the rather extreme degree to which immunity applies.  The image of parliamentary deputies participating in what would be considered mass hooliganism by some is just too precious to leave out.

Anyway, I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism, only to say that most scientists  racist and anti-racist  have not been persecuted the way Galileo was.  Perhaps racist scientists should be.  But even here I would qualify it  not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context  we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind.  In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things.  But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

Hello and welcome to Wikipedia!  We appreciate encyclopedic contributions, but some of your recent edits do not conform to our policies.

"Disclaimer 

Disclaimer
This talk page should remain BLANK, so any message here would probably be deleted without being read. To prevent this, I recommend you to post your comments according to the indications below.

1. Comments related to article content
This is not the place for them. Every wikipedia page has a Talk Page. If you are unhappy with what I've wrote, you want clarification or you want to suggest improvement, press discussion on the top of the respective page and express your concerns. This way, more people will see your comments and maybe they will be able to help you more.

2. Warnings
Don't put it here. Choose a random page (preferably a talk page) and put your warning there. Admins will consider I have been warned anyway, so why ruin my Talk page?

3. Blocks
If you're an Admin and you have blocked me, don't note it here. I'll surely notice it when I try to edit an article. If you want to show others how strong you are, there's always my Block log. In case you want to give me the chance to ask a review of my block, don't bother. Other Admins will most probably agree with you, and even the ones who think the block was not fair will do nothing about it. So why waste your time?

4. Personal comments
If you want to tell me something important, but not related to one of the categories above, don't write here. Keep it for yourself. Of course, if you want to warn be about a imminent nuclear attack against South Eastern Romania, you could send me an e-mail. But only then. So please, no personal comments here.

5. Vandalism
Why vandalise this talk page that few people watch when you can vandalise the page of a country, a city or a president? More people will see you and you'll gain a better reputation.

Speedy deletion of Reclamation Process
 A tag has been placed on Reclamation Process requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —BradV  """,0

No prob.  Thanks for contacting me.  Believe me, I'd rather help you than block you.  So, here's some reading material:  Wikipedia:Manual of style.  This is an excellent resource for learning how to contribute here.  I'm also as close as my talk page.  Sorry to have come off harsh, but you wouldn't believe the sort of really weird edits from people who mean to harm the site instead of help it.  I'm extremely pleased to help you if you'd like. -  

Wiki brah, why did you move a nomination for admin?  I'm not objecting, just confused.  Also, btw, how did you come across that page - it's not a usual page for new users to come across at first. Thanks in advance for your response.  

Ho cakes

Uh, right.  )

WB, what are you doing...?  I said I'd help you but if you do another edit like that last one, it'll be a time out.  OK?  No more weirdness?  Thanks. -  

Well, in order to stay, your articles really need to meet a certain level of quality.  I'm sure you mean well, but you really need to settle down a tad and get a feel for the site.  You can't treat this like a blog page.  """"Ho cakes?""""  I admit, it made me laugh, especially the """"featured article"""" header.  But...stuff like that really isn't the best use of the site's resources.  The nice folks who pay for the servers want the best possible return on their investment.  Tell you what:  I have to run, but if you have an idea for an article, why not stop by my talk page and let me know what it is?  Maybe if I show you how to write a good article, you might understand WIkipedia better. -  

It's OK.  We'll get you up to speed.  However, you should decide on a single user name.  Right now, you're bouncing between three of them.  How 'bout we just stick with this one here? -  

Last warning.  If you continue to post nonsense, or to disrupt Wikipedia by slapping a delete template on Cindy Sheehan, you WILL be blocked.   01:52, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, that is exactly what I was coming here to do.  That was uncalled for as was """"Monkey spank.""""  Gotta give you a time out for a couple of days for disrupting this site.  Nothing personal.  However, you can still edit this page if you wish to respond to the block. -  

 Good Morning 

so what are you doing and going on?  Why is everyone being mean to me?  I am just trying to help.  I read some guidelines and articles and don't think she is a notable person just like a stuntwoman on tv for brief fame.  I am getting better but still sort of autistic my parents still keep me here. 

No one wants to be mean to you.  I had a feeling you were autistic and I'm working with a couple of other autistic users.  We welcome you here.  But, you need to remember that this isn't a playground and that you simply can't edit the way you have been.  I'm giving you one more chance.  I'll remove your block, but only if you do the right thing, OK?  Let us all help you. -  

OK, Brah.  I've unblocked you.  Now, please be good and edit like I know you can.  I have to go, but I'm keeping an eye on you.  )  Thanks. -  

Hi, WB.  Man, I'm glad it was you and not the vandal I'm dealing with right now who's messing up my page.  

If you want, I'll gladly paste that English-speaking template to your user page.  As far as making templates is concerned, they're pretty much like making articles, but I think you have to have the green light from other users before you create one.  I'll look into that for you.  Gotta run after I fix your user page. -

Hey Gareth, could you please check out the question at Talk:Mlahsö language? Thanks, khoi 

 Your opinion please... 

I believe we discussed the phenomenon of wikipedians leveling accusation of """"original research"""" that stretch their definition of """"original research"""" to unreasonable extremes.

I've received another accusation of """"original research""""  this time from an administrator  who left an admonishment that could be interpreted as a threat of blocking, or some other sanction.

Could you take a look at this colloquoy?
Do you concur that conflating Yakup with Yakub was original research?

FWIW I believe this is the first exchange I have ever had with this administrator.

As before, I am happy to look for your reply here, on your talk page, if that is convenient for you.

Thanks!  —   

P.S.  I hope I can do something for you some time.  -)

As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either """"Vatican II is infallible"""" or """"Vatican II is not infallible"""".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:
“There are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” (General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)

Sorry, the """"three revert"""" thing was my mistake.

The """"indiscriminate collection of information"""" section of WP:NOT does not explicitly cover the issue, as Jeffrey O. Gustafson seems to believe, and I believe there is definitely room for some POV. Again, this could have been settled in a debate, but Jeffrey O. Gustafson was just too good for that.

"Response Pardon me, but I just noticed your message.

Byrgenwulf has been making unsupported, unverifiable attacks on the topic of this article. Indeed, in clear violation of Wikipedia policy regarding neutrality and verifiability, both of you have been attacking the content, or topic, of the article rather than the article itself. All that the article has to do is faithfully report what appeared in the press and was written by Langan; given the clear notability of the content, you have no right whatsoever to carp and complain about it, at least in the capacity of Wikipedia editors acting in good faith. All you can do is report what other sufficiently notable people have said about the theory in sufficiently reputable and verifiable sources. If you choose to carp and complain anyway, particularly in a way that influences how the article is edited - after all, voting for deletion amounts to attempting to edit the article, right out of existence in fact, and likewise for encouraging others to vote as you do - then you are yourself in contempt of Wikipedia policy, and it is hypocritical of you to complain when you get the worst of it.

Instead of supporting his (and your) claims, as is your editorial responsibility, Byrgenwulf ignored his responsibility and attempted to infuse his attacks with authority by claiming to be a professional philosopher of physics. He did this both voluntarily and dishonestly, and that is now a proven fact. Once you have been shown to be something, that's it - anybody can point it out, as many times as he or she likes. If Byrgenwulf has been shown to be dishonest, or not an expert as he claims to be, anyone is free to state as much whenever convenient. Wikipedia policy is not just something that people like Byrgenwulf, and you, and jeffire, can point to when you don't like the way things are going for you, but then ignore whenever you can get away with it. It is something that applies to you as well. 

Incidentally, although you may think that I find your supercilious comments about philosophy impressive, this is anything but the case. Quite the opposite, in fact. I am quite certain, on the basis of your snide and shallow comments, that your level of philosophical understanding is nothing to respect. In fact, it may even be as deficient as Byrgenwulf's own. Please bear this in mind as you attempt to do the Wikipedia community, and the world at large, a monumental disservice by attacking a valuable, informative, and well-referenced article on a notable topic just to strike a blow for your own inability to comprehend it while meanwhile advancing your own opinions. Truly, this is a black mark on your record.",0

Second opinion by Ericleb01

I'm following up on Cannibaloki's review. I completed an entire copy-edit of the article, but I'm going to have to fail this, mainly because it doesn't cover enough material. The """"Bostaph's departure"""" section does not belong in this article, as, while it does mention the DVD, his leave from the band has nothing to do with it. With that gone, I would recommend you look at other example concert video GAs, such as Number Ones (video) and Celebration: The Video Collection, as well as WP:ALBUM#Article body for some ideas. Also, use a bit less quotations, as it disrupts the flow when reading. This is really close to passing in my book, however, so don't give this up! EricLeb01 ( | Talk) """,0

Hmm...I found this in Nature about copernicium's symbol. So was cyclopentadienyl a factor, or not? (Do you have information about this? It would be great if added to the WP article on copernicium, because it would clear up all these misconceptions.) If it was a factor, IUPAC's decision makes a lot of sense, because Cp is still used. If it wasn't, I find it a lot harder to understand. Granted """"cassiopeium"""" was often used by German-speaking chemists in the early 20th century, but IIRC this usage is almost extinct now?!

Thanks for reverting that back again. FYI I’ve not decided that all geographic articles should list any football clubs in the area in the lead section.

 Notification: changes to """"Mark my edits as minor by default"""" preference 

Hello there. This is an automated message to tell you about the gradual phasing out of the preference entitled """"Mark all edits minor by default"""", which you currently have (or very recently had) enabled.

On 13 March 2011, this preference was hidden from the user preferences screen as part of efforts to prevent its accidental misuse (consensus discussion, guidelines for use at WP:MINOR). This had the effect of locking users in to their existing preference, which, in your case, was true. To complete the process, your preference will automatically be changed to false in the next few days. This does not require any intervention on your part and all users will still be able to manually mark their edits as being minor in the usual way.

 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",0

 Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet's character 

The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father's miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.

The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.

Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.

"Sons of Ali al-Hadi (Imam Ali Naqi)
There is no conclusion over three sons or seven.  Why it is considered necessary to place a full stop after mentioning three sons.  Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of reference being emphasized with the availability of an ISBN # and its publishing in English language by a foreign expert (his dignity is recognized, but critical view is our right).  In my discussion  Abu Mikhnaf is one of primary sources per norm of social science (history).

 Primary sources: relate to an event, written by someone who experienced or witnessed the event in question by  letters, memoirs, journals, speeches, manuscripts, etc.

Secondary sources: function to interpret primary sources.  Secondary sources interpret to assign value and draw conclusions about the events reported in primary sources.
 
When evaluating primary or secondary sources, the very basis warrants to know:
(i)How does the author know these details
(ii) Was the author present at the event or soon on the scene? 
(iii) Where does this information come from, i.e. personal experience, eyewitness, or reports written by others?

Thus the reliability of an scholar (Wilferd Madelung ) belonging to a belated period (20th century) depending on single source of tenth century does not sense to overrule the very old primary source of 8th century  which is not only supported by millions of naqvis/naqavis  of the world (particularly the sub-continent) but also evident from the various published (secondary) sources e.g. Gulzar-e-Naqi (Riaz ulnasab), compiled with the help of 38 books annexing 40 pedigrees, by a family member of Ali Naqi Naqvi .  The writer belongs to well educated family, his two elder brothers were college principals in colleges of  Punjab.  Among his brothers Dr. Sohail Bukhari was an authority in Urdu Literature  in his time besides being an author for Punjab Text Books for school and colleges.

In view of above discussion the section which provides explanation to the confusion in numbering and names of sons should remain in the main article for research and reference, in terms of EN-WP being  the tertiary source.",0

Well, your comments certainly sound authoritative!  Why do you privilege Friedrich's narrative over Bazzana's?  His biography is quite clear on this point: """"[Glenn's] birth certificate gave his name as 'Gold, Glenn Herbert.'  The family name had always been Gold, and when his grandfather...established the family business in 1913, he gave it the name 'Gold Standard Furs' (pun presumably intended).  All of the documents through 1938 that survive among Gould's papers give his surname as 'Gold,' but beginning at least as early as 1939 the family name was almost always printed as 'Gould' in newspapers, programs, and other sources; the last confirmed publication of 'Gold' is in the program for a church supper and concert on October 27, 1940."""" (Bazzana, Wondrous Strange, 24).

Now, I don't want to stand in the way of your sanctimoniousness, but I believe that documentary evidence weighs in as the only proof of historical fact.  Your quotation from Friedrich offers no documentary evidence  only an undated business card.

Bazzana goes on to discuss the regrettable climate of increasing xenophobia that apparently prevailed in Toronto at the time, and the influence this may have had on the (documented!) name change, but any thoughtful person can surmise from the dates (1939-40) that this may have been the case.

In any event, this entire discussion is much less """"problematic and harmful"""" (whatever that means) than inane and boring.  The information is anecdotal, and of mild and passing interest, but really, WHO CARES on way or the other?  """,0

Harlan started by discussing personal matters about my family.  Sune has harassed me throughout several articles, on my own talk page and has even reproduced discussions here on his own web pages.

 New Reversion War 

Hi,
I don't know whether you've been keeping up with the Race article or not. Somebody put some unrepresentative pictures up and labeled them as members of various [races]. That addition was reverted by Peak, and several more reversions have occurred without any discussion other than in the edit summaries.

After checking the photo credits I added the following caption to the photo to try to properly contextualize them: 

Fugitives categorized by the FBI into different """"races"""". From left to right: White, Black, Hispanic Mestizo, Asian. Top row males, bottom row females.Does asserting a racial identity give any more information than is contained in the photographs? See the discussion below.

The original pictures were a nasty practical joke, I think, but Sam Spade likes them, and several other people have aided him in his reversions. I don't want another edit war, so I am hoping that you will watch developments and, if you agree that my way is a compromise that will not propagate disinformation, you will perhaps freeze the page in my version until the combattants come to the bargaining table.

Thank you.  15:51, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)""",0

 Removed genetics attack subsection 

I removed the entire following attack subsection from the """"Genetics"""" section:

===Clarification===

It is clear from the graphs contained in the 2012 Turkish Cat Genetics Study that the majority of the Turkish Angora samples submitted show only minor traces of the original Ankara Zoo cats.  Ankara Zoo sample No 9575 shows a 72.14% signature mistakenly referred to as the Cyprus group since it is also common to many Cyprus cats—whereas the Turkish Angoras of the cat fancy  show a generally insignificant but widely variable percentage this critical identifying signature. Other examples from Turkey that show these signatures are 13558, 76.77%,  and   9702, 97.02%.  Supposed samples from Turkey that matched the cat fancy Angoras cannot be verified or confirmed. In fact, the supposed authors of those samples deny any knowledge of them.
Considering that these """"scientific studies"""" from the genetics laboratory of Leslie Lyons of UC Davis assume that American Turkish Angoras are the authentic Turkish Angoras, as her website says, then cats that differ from those samples are not Turkish Angoras. This is highly flawed and misleading pseudo-science, which breeders may consider genetic proof.
Please note that the 2012 Turkish Cat Genetics Study was neither published nor is available on a webpage but consists only of an e-mail with attached graphs sent to interested Turkish cat breeders. Further details and citations may be obtainable at.-  http://www.turkishangoracat.org/arastirma.aspx?arastirmaId=1

"Organisation

This article is primarily about the World Cricket League and, although the regional competitions are connected to this in the sense that they act as qualification, I think the section could be considerably reduced - particularly now the regional competitions have less impact on new teams entering the league.

I think the Regional Tournament section ought to be vastly cut down, removing the table and leaving an overview of the qualification of teams from regional tournaments, a small table outlining teams that have qualified via this process and an in-text link to the various articles on the regional tournaments. By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere.

Another improvement to the article could be a rework of the table on previous WCL tournaments and adding an explanatory introduction to make it more comprehensive to the first time viewer.

I won't make any changes to the article unless other contributors think these ideas would improve it. I'd value your comments.",0

WP:SYNTH
An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.   
The concluding statement says the term """"climate change denial"""" may be used if the source """"implicitly states they fall into the general group.""""  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for """"synthesis"""".    
I don't think anyone is looking for """"loopholes"""". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.   
There is nothing """"slavish"""" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.    
 I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.   
As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically """"no consensus at all"""".  Cheers.   
Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines """"Christian terrorism"""" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term """"Christian religious terrorism"""" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression """"Christian terrorism"""" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about """"religious communal terrorism"""" carried out by Christians, or """"nationalist terrorism"""" between different religious groups.
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC?
  
I'm so tempted to just reply """"yes"""". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of """"Christian terrorism"""" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word """"genocide"""" instead of the word """"terrorism"""". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t",0

 I'm not seeing what points readers to Hotchkiss in popular culture. Please clarify.

If the section is called """"Hotchkiss in Print"""" then maybe movie references are not appropriate here, or the section should be renamed.

As to your point about """"disgruntled alums:"""" Whether the quotations are positive or negative is immaterial. If they are references in print and they shed light on the history and reputation of the school, then the quotations seem entirely appropriate here. Would we want to include every last mention of Hotchkiss in the written record? Perhaps not. However, below are reasons for including quotes I have recently added (actually, re-added because they were removed at some point).

Thomas Hoving quotation: Hoving is one of the more notable alums, a longtime director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a public figure who is also an alum, his perspective on the school is significant. McPhee is also a leading writer of profiles and this piece originally appeared in the New Yorker. So, it's authoritative.

The Cullman quotation: I believe Cullman was chairman of the board of trustees, and the Cullman family has been one of the school's major supporters. Since Cullman is an alumnus and a prominent supporter, his comments on the school are worth noting.

Julian Houston is a judge in Massachusetts. As a successful legal professional, an alumnus, and a person of color, who has written a book that is clearly based on his experience at the school, it is appropriate to quote him on his time at the school.

Archibald MacLeish is among the school's most prominent alumni. Because of his stature, his comments on the school are notable.

Lemisch is both an alumnus and an emeritus history professor, who has written an article on the history of Hotchkiss. Because he is an alum and a historian, and because the subject of this article is the history of the school, a quotation from it is notable.

The above reasons support the relevance of these quotations to this article.

If there are other quotes by prominent alums who enjoyed their time at Hotchkiss, of course those would be worth citing here as well. """,0
"""

This RS question is whether Stephen Hill, the cofounder of a notable niche music genre, """"spacemusic"""", can be disqualified as a secondary source expert, and have his radio production company's website (= expert's book) reclassified with primary source usage restrictions (results in removal). 

The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago (35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA). HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500. This 2004-01-11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill's expertise reads: 
""""Hill, who coined the term """"spacemusic"""" more than 20 years ago, hosts the """"Music From the Hearts of Space"""" music program, syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations, including San Francisco's KALW 91.7 FM, which airs two hours of the program at 10 p.m. Sundays. In addition, Hill's Hearts of Space Web site (www.hos.com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music.""""

The claim as I understand it (maybe I don't), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis/OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder's detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. 

The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a """"commercial entity's branding drive"""". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. 

Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame. Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered, but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives. Its niche music sales amount to less than 1% of the commercial market, so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising. 

(The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary, and then removed for synthesis/OR, should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload.) 
 

 I suppose all this would give some reason for caution in using these sources, and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double-source things and to give all sides where sources disagree, but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source. Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre, or about his own show, he's primary. Where he's writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. -  | Talk 

I agree with  on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic.  On the primary/secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show. On third-party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he'd be a secondary source.   I'd say that within his area of expertise, there's no reason not to use his work as a reliable source.   

Just to be clear about the encyclopedia-margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying: 

Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert-based secondary sources via WP:V(WP:SPS). The Wikipedia art/music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art/music genre knows subjectively more about what he/she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion. You are changing that.

What a secondary source says can be combined in a point-by-point source-provable editorial analysis. In this case, since there are so few other mainstream sources, many or most of them are presently combined with Hill's previous secondary source expertise to write the article.

But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source. What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis, even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t",0
"Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.

I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.

In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.

A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?

Fastfission, I welcome your thoughts on the article and examples. In defense, here is some reply to the most telling point (and heart of the method) The """"predictions"""" section puts the horse before the cart: Watson had already seen the B-form photograph before they thought of proposing the double helix. In Watson's Double Helix memoir, he clearly states that he and Crick had already worked out the mathematics of the Fourier transform of a Helix as an X-shape. They had come upon it with the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and had already deduced TMV had a spiral shape. At the time of discovery (of structure of DNA) they did not know the orientation of the bases (inside or outside the helix) which Watson deduced by his concrete modelling of the nucleotide pairs. The discovery (of structure of DNA) came after, at least according to Watson's memoir. And Watson is still alive to clarify this for us. It is a golden opportunity for someone to ask and write down so that we can cite. But the article clearly states that scientific method is not linear, as you have well put. It is a horse-race between the steps, some of which can then be linearized after the moment of discovery, for publication. I do not mind the adjective lousy; in Feynman's words English is a lousy language, yet we somehow manage to communicate with it, and those of us who are prisoners of the tongue even attempt to think with it as well.

"Thats simply not true. The following from Appleman:

The large numbers of Korean refugees crowding the Yongdong area undoubtedly helped the enemy infiltrate the 1st Cavalry Division positions. On 24 July, for example, a man dressed in white carrying a heavy pack, and accompanied by a woman appearing to be pregnant, came under suspicion. The couple was searched and the woman's assumed pregnancy proved to be a small radio hidden under her clothes. She used this radio for reporting American positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes.

In the meantime, and pursuant to General Walker's order on the 11th, Colonel Murch's 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry, had been engaged in helping to clear the enemy from the area south of Yongsan. On the 11th Murch's battalion departed from its assembly area near Masan and rolled north toward the Naktong River. A steady stream of Korean refugees clogged the road. As the battalion pushed its way through this traffic a refugee cart overturned, exposing about fifteen rifles and several bags of ammunition. Approximately twelve North Korean soldiers disguised as refugees accompanying it fled across an open field.

 Had you bothered to look at the references provided, you would see the sentence on Taejon is cited to Sloan, not Appleman. From Sloan:

but now hundreds of enemy infiltrators, many clad in white to mingle undetected with civilian refugees who moved freely among the American troops, were all around the men of the 34th. There was no safe haven from snipers firing rifles and tossing grenades from scores of buildings, and soon after daylight, NKPA tanks rumbled into the city.

 This is especially important considering that Mucio used the defeat at Taejon and the Nork use of refugee infiltrators as factor in his decision.  

 I have also found dozens of accounts from June-August 1950 in the papers speaking of Nork troops using refugees to mask their movements. If you continue to strip the article of this crucial context, I will put every singe account I can find in the article. I believe what we have here is an adequate summary of the tactics the Norks uses which drove the US policy on refugees.",0

 MSM 

Agreed

Every single source I have and Puellanivis has referred to has said that TG/TS women are considered MSM or """"along side"""" MSM. The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.

The rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   

No, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they """"biological"""" sex.

Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS/TG are recorded as MSM.

Abstraction: ``We have developed an exceptionally powerful technique for dealing with complexity. We abstract from it. Unable to master the entirety of a complex object, we choose to ignore the inessential details, dealing instead with the generalized, idealized model of the object"""" Wulf in Shaw, 1981). 
Formality: Rigor at each stage in the development of a system. 

Divide and conquer: Divide a complex problem into a set of simpler problems that can be solved. 

Hierarchical ordering: Order the simplification of the problem in ``divide & conquer"""" in hierarchies. 

Cohesion & coupling: Modularise the system such that interactions within components (cohesion) is maximised and interactions between components (coupling) is minimised. This way, the impact of errors, when they arise, is localised and does not cascade through the system. Diagnosis of offending components is also made easier. 

Information hiding: Each module (or subsystem) must have available to it just the information that is needed by it. 

Conceptual integrity: Consistency in design. 

Completeness: Ensuring that the design meets all the specifications. 

Logical independence: Emphasis on the statement of system objectives in terms of logical functions independent of physical implementation. 

Correctness & Efficiency: Correct in the sense that the design meets all the user requirements. Efficient in that the system accomplishes the objectives with minimum computing resources.""",0

on the Creator
The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from """"something"""". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   
Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the """"concept of God"""" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.

The purpose of operation Flavius was to prevent the bombing of the military band and the purpose of the PIRA cell in Gibraltar, was to place a bomb in a public place to effect that.  Hiding that is a distortion of both the official IRA statement that they were on 'active service' and the inquest verdict.

Its highly regretable that people are shot on our streets, and unlike some places, its not an everyday occurance. Indeed nobody has been shot since - but although there is no crime of 'being Irish in Gibraltar' it remains the position that terrorists can, and will be shot. Although we do not anticipate any more visits from Ireland, due to the proximity to North Africa there are new threats.

One of the NYT articles cited says that the position with Britain is complicated because it does not have a written constitution - this is sloppy journalism because Gibraltar has one and despite a subsequent version, the section which deals with this incident remains 'as was'.",0

In ictu oculi
As has been explained, """"POVfork"""" is one of the ritual phrases you incant on this page; because it defies reality, it is an excuse to avoid meaningful discourse, rather than an attempt at achieving it. If you mean something else, which you likely do, then use words that are accurate and express your meaning, rather than obsessively repeating obviously false statements.
As has also been explained, repeating long lists of last names, without any context (e.g. """"Voorst, Horbury, Schafer, Berger, Maier, Meier, Theissen, Klausner, Rubenstein, Boyarin, Teppler, Stanton & Stroumsa, Kessler, Sanders, Neusner"""") are also ritual behaviors that have little semantic content. You have been challenged to produce actual citations, which would include book names, author, year, page number, and relevant quotations. You continually refuse or fail to do so.
When you finally produce a citation that more-or-less complies with WP:CITE (albeit with completely idiosyncratic formatting), you still get it wrong. For example, you just now added what you describe as """"Quarles (2008)"""". In fact, the reference is Bauckham (2008): I know this because I added it myself three weeks ago! Not only that, the material you added was already present in the article, in the very section in which I added the citation! If you do not read the article, then how can you comment on its contents, much less attempt to edit them?
I have kept your Voorst citation, and again, put it where it belongs. For the longest time, the lede had the sentence """"There are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to Christianity and the Christian figure of Jesus"""", with the citation Such as Dalman This reference, of course, is one of your infamous """"last name only"""" citations, which completely fail WP:CITE. Rather than replace it with Voorst, who makes the same point, and is a century newer, you oddly repeat the material in a second sentence. There is no rational explanation for doing this that I can see.
We absolutely do have a neutral first sentence in the lede, despite your best attempts to the contrary - that was the clear consensus of the RFC above. You fixation on the claim that Yeshu does not refer to an individual or individuals leaves you in a very difficult spot. It has been your on-going contention that the name """"Yeshu"""" is merely the name used by rabbis for Jesus. However, when you insist that """"Yeshu"""" does not refer to an individual, or demand proof that it does, what you are also demanding is proof that """"Jesus"""" refers to an individual, since it is you that insists """"Yeshu""""=""""Jesus"""". Do you not believe Jesus was and indivudal? Are you promoting, then, the Jesus myth theory?
I am doing my best still to assume good faith here; unfortunately, to do so, I am forced to come to the conclusion that the issue with your edits and comments here is one of competence. I am now very strongly encouraging you to propose changes here, accurately citing the reliable sources you would like to use to support those edits.

Magnum Crimen
This article and AfD discussion might interest you.   

 Talkback 

Bongomatic 

  - talk 

 Smears 

Hi Turqoise127

A number of your recent edits (the AfD for Boba Phat, Cyclopia's talk page) state or imply the existence of editors ganging up to game Wikipedia's processes, and further imply the inappropriateness of such. 

First, if you want to talk about inappropriate ganging up, you should be aware of a formal body that exists in practice almost solely to vote in blocs against deletion. The Article Rescue Squadron works by tagging articles with a template, so that other editors are alerted to the existence of a speedy, prod, or AfD nomination. The usual result is vote packing at AfD discussions without improvement to articles (the nominal goal of the squadron). This leads to far more """"unfair advantage"""" by virtue of """"block votes"""" and """"sway[ing of] opinion"""" than a few editors who occasionally show up at the same AfD discussions. 

Here's the great thing about AfD discussions. Anyone (except sock puppets and blocked users) can show up and opine. All someone needs to do is go to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion#Current discussions and start browsing. You may think that when a number of editors show up opining """"delete"""" for an article, and none on the other side show up to opine """"keep"""", it's an indication of unfair voting blocs. But in fact, it generally indicates that:
 editors who have a predilection to stringent interpretation of WP:N agree it's not notable;
 middle-of-the-road editors agree it's not notable; and
 editors who have a predilection to a lenient interpretation of WP:N either believe in their hearts that it's a clear-cut case, or realize that the obvious weight of the consensusnotwithstanding their disagreementmakes it not worthwhile to bother opining. 

The same occurs where """"keep"""" is either obvious to all, or so widely supported that editors with limited time don't bother to tilt at windmills. I don't know how other editors do it, but when I browse through AfD discussions, I tend not to bother with snowball cases in either direction unless I have some knowledge of the subject or believe an important principle is being illustrated. 

In any event, your continued smear campaign against """"certain groups"""" as """"plainly unfair"""" is against policy and has become more than tiresome. Cut it out. 

Bongomatic 

Hi Bongomatic, it is flattering how you stalk me and react to every single contribution I make. However I think you are over-reacting a bit. I mentioned no names in any of my comments; they were general. If expressing my views on certain events that I witness is against policy, please tell me how so, because it reaks of censorship. I do stand by my views, I think you know that. And even though I like and respect you, I am not really looking for friends here. Your article rescue squadron comment and illustration is definitely a valid point, but you must take into account that they (squadron) are reactionary, so they (at least I think, could be wrong) react to deletionist strong-arming of marginal or worthy articles that really could/should be kept. Be that as it may, if you ever feel something I do is against policy, do what you gotta do, caus I will not be changing anytime soon. I am still looking at my options regarding my issues; do nothing and attempt to soften influence with my presence on here, write essays, discuss at water pump, arb com, whatever. I don't know enough about Wiki yet. I will learn though...  

Bongomatic, while what you say is formally true, and I agree that ARS can be kind of questionable -even if I like it and even tag ARS sometimes- it is also true that the same names often come out at AfDs, in both camps -including myself rec",0

Century formats
Re: Alcohol laws of New Jersey. If you have a problem with centuries being spelled out (nineteenth and twentieth instead of 19th and 20th) you probably shouldn't have pointed to a policy (WP:CENTURY) that allows either form (in this case spelling it out) only requiring that usage be consistent. Claiming that the official title of a legislative act (TEA-21) that uses 21st (one mention that is not our writings and is something out of our control), is grounds for reverting 6 others in an article that is already """"internally consistent"""" as you put it, that is disingenuous and some would consider it disruptive editing.

Ormewood is correct that later revisions by someone (to put all wind considerations into one section) caused a loss of continuity. I was the original author of the section """"Shape of The Tower"""" in March of 2007, so I know that the orphaned sentences answer the question: What mathmatical calculation was Eiffel referring to? I tried to edit the article, but found it is now semi-protected owing to excessive vandalism. I propose that an autoconfirmed user revise the entire paragraph as follows:
In search of what mathmatical calculation Eiffel referred to, researchers have found that Eiffel used empirical and graphical methods accounting for the effects of wind rather than a specific mathmatical formula. Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape; actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces. Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. As a demonstration of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.

Below I am pasting an email from a historian, whom I asked about the correct title.| talk  

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.
It is normally preferable to keep the German term, italicized, and give a sentence or so of explanation.""",0

 Complex issue 

 This is quite a complex issue. There have been a few cases around the world where individual officials have solemnised marriages (e.g. France, Greece, Quintana Roo in Mexico). I don't think these jurisdictions should be included in the template, since there is no generalised recognition of same-sex marriage or possibility of generally entering into a legal same-sex marriage. However, what we have in Alagoas seems a bit different. I am prima facie in favour of including Alagoas based on the reasoning of User:Denisxavier. However, before we include Alagoas, we need a bit more information about how Brazilian marriage law works. In particular, I have two questions:

 *When an opposite-sex couple wants to enter into a marriage in Brazil, how do they do it? Are legal marriages registered at a Civil Registry Office, which conducts a civil ceremony and provides the marriage certificate? What is the role of the judge in these marriages? Also, what is a """"Notary""""? Are they a state official working in a Civil Registry Office, or a private person who can register marriages? The issue I am interested in here is: is the process for entering into a same-sex marriage identical to entering into an opposite-sex marriage in Alagoas? Or are there administrative / procedural differences?
 *Are Civil Registry Offices/Notaries obliged to register same-sex marriages in Alagoas, or are they merely allowed to do so? If they are not obliged to do so, then I think it's more problematic to include Alagoas in the template, because it means that the law is not being applied consistently.

 The fact that the highest federal court has not yet ruled on the matter is in my opinion irrelevant. When the Supreme Court of California legalised same-sex marriage in California, we still included it in the template, even if the Supreme Court of the US did not yet give its opinion. Wikipedia is flexible enough that it can accommodate to changing realities; if a superior court strikes down the lower court, then all we need to do is simply change the template again. This has been done a few times already. Cheers, '''''' ✉ """,0

Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.

The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions.""""

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments

You are only now presenting sources for some of the information which you have inserted. In your last revision of the article, you did not cite the sentence about fundamentalism. Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists.

"""Gothic Chess has the King in the center of the board with the Chancellor on 1 side and the Archbishop on the other. This is a very important difference. The piece distribution is smooth. There is 1 new pieces to the left of the king, 1 new piece to the right of the king, and the other chess material is where it belongs.  In Embassy, having the east-west mirror you mentioned makes a big difference also. The game is played """"upside down"""", as the east-west mirror is reversing the color of your pieces. Clearly in chess you remember this is the case. Black is the east-west mirror of white. So, Embassy Chess has white playing as black on the queenside, and the lopsided distribution on the kingside.

I am going to point out that, by your own logic, this article should be moved either to Volksetymologie, since that logocentric originary-story is your key justification for the exclusivity of the term to linguistics, or to False etymology, since linguists, unlike folklorists, insist that the etymology be factually incorrect. However, I suggest doing neither of these things, because the simple empirical situation before us is that the term is used, and has long been used, and is authoritatively defined, in two distinct but related senses in two distinct buyt related disciplines and this is where users would ordinarily look up either sense. It is hgih time you all dealt with the evidence you yourselves demanded of me, and put me to the work of gathering, before moving the goalposts.   18:19",0

I would say that the bottom line is if independent reliable sources describe Cox as Catholic, then we can go with that. The difference is that Cox belongs to a schismatic organization that is several levels removed from the Catholic Church. Williamson, in his association with the SSPX, was directly ordained by a Catholic Church bishop and remained Catholic, even while not in full communion. Note that the Catholic Church affirmed that attendance at an SSPX chapel would fulfill the Sunday obligation, i.e. in a """"Catholic rite"""". I do not know if the Catholic Church has commented on the canonical status of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church, or the validity of the Thuc line of apostolic succession. My suggestion for a succinct description of Cox would be """"Independent Catholic bishop"""", as that is how his church is described.   """,0

I won't comment further on the book, as I think my comments below are sufficient.
Regarding the Web sites, I would note that there seems to be very few Web sites on Plasma Cosmology / Plasma Universe (unlike sites on Big Bang cosmology), and I think that is worth taking into account.
plasmacosmology.net

... the site certainly isn't peer reviewed, and it is unlikely to have been produced by an """"authority""""... the Contact page says """"Independent Researcher""""
... The site more closely resembles a """"blog"""" since it appears to be produced by one person, but that is not grounds for automatic dismissal. We already include a page from the Web site of Ned Wright,, and while he is obviously an authority on Big Bang cosmology, I would argue that he is not an authority on Plasma Cosmology. Nevertheless, I am sure he points out some errors in Eric Lerner's work, and I am sure that Lerner has pointed out misunderstandings in Wright's. Either way, there seems to be value in Wright and Lerner's pages (irrespective of whether we agree with their points of view). Likewsise, I think there is value in plasmacosmology.net, even though there may be disagreements with parts of it.
thunderbolts.info
I must declare a potential conflict of interest with the site, as I am shown as a contributor,, so I will refrain from commenting more, unless you specifically ask me to do so, now knowing the connection.

As to your first point, if the reverts were to get rid of BLP violations, I would support the person removing the BLP violations. Such biographies can have a serious impact on a person's life and social standing, so lies and unverifiable content in such articles cause far more damage than edit warring does. (This does not mean that I support edit warring on BLPs in general, edit warring over well-sourced information remains unacceptable.) However, FICT issues are not BLP, the damage caused by edit-warring and endless strife far over Pokemon outweighs the damage caused by breaching a notability guideline, so I cannot quite see the analogy here.
I don't think you have been stonewalling the WP:FICT discussion, and I have not opposed, nor will I oppose you, due to your views on what the content policy ought to be on that issue. Indeed, I think your approach there has generally been constructive. The opposition is based on how you dealt with the people who very strongly disagreed with your position, and the """"vandal"""" comment, followed up with defenses of it being """"civil"""" and then merely """"poorly worded"""" worry me.
Regarding A Nobody, while I view that editor as basically constructive, he is fairly far off to the inclusionist side on the """"inclusionist-deletionist"""" scale, and fairly far off from where I stand.

You're both right in the sense that enough is enough. If you haven't noticed, I've hardly contributed a thing to the RefDesk in quite a while. If you also haven't noticed, many other valuable editors who used to contribute regularly just, say, a year ago, are now long gone. I suppose I was left the only one to hold the fort. It's now clear, however, that you simply don't appreciate what's happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.

I know this will be futile, but I'll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any """"humanities"""" related topic. This was the Humanities RefDesk I fell in love with.

Now, however, it's pretty much dominated by one supposed omniscient Cambridge Phd. One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the """"folly"""" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to """"stand corrected"""".

These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian. 

But once again, you're right. Enough is enough. I've spent far too much time and effort on this. If you'd indeed prefer the Humanities RefDesk to degenerate into a ClioBlog, then that last obstacle you've been facing, little old Loomis51, has given up. I fought the good fight, and I'm damned proud of it. This, to me, is truly a sad day for Wikipedia.

This is no grand exit, no demand to be blocked, nothing melodramatic like that. I still love Wikipedia and its articles. Unfortunately that once great Humanities RefDesk that I couldn't wait to come to visit upon returning home from work, in order to learn new things, and (hopefully) return the favour by sharing whatever I know with others, is no longer. 

I'm not really sure what all those nonsensical """"conditions"""" you noted above were, nor did I pay much attention to them. Whether my words above are some sort of """"breach"""" of those conditions, I have no idea, nor do I care. 

I just can't help but find it funny that you've extended your jurisdiction to Wikiversity. What's next? If you can somehow hack into my Yahoo account, will my emails now be scrutinized for any anti-Clio content? How about MSN? Is it ok if I call Stu up on the phone and speak """"inappropriately"""" of her? lol (Not that either of us really cares about all this bullshit to actually talk on the phone about it, we have lives, you know! We've never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he's apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio's a fraud! I'm actually rather curious. I've often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!) 

If you want to block me, then block me. If you don't, then don't. It's all so obviously arbitrary that I really don't give a shit at this point what you do. All you should know is that I'm just pretty much fed up with the whole RefDesk farce, and I don't really see myself engaging in it in any way any time soon. I have absolutely no intention of any further """"Doctor Anastasia"""" bashing, as like I said, it's futile. If you don't believe me, then block me. If not, then don't. Do as you please.

Let me just mark this day, June 4th, 2007. Let's just see how the Humanities RefDesk looks in say, six months from now: December 4th, 2007. Will all be as is? Will any of my remarks ring any truer? Let's just see. In the meantime, adios muchachos!

Early life

Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of mixed Danish-Polish and German descent. His father, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood.[7] Once, for no known reason, Howard Hanssen arranged for his son to fail a driver's test. In later life, Robert Hanssen speculated that his father had done this in order to 'toughen him up'. The elder Hanssen constantly disparaged his son and said that Robert would never make anything of his life.[8]

Hanssen graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1966. While at Knox, he took an interest in Russian through elective courses. It was also at this time when Hanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the NSA but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. Originally set to become a doctor, Hanssen took the opportunity to enroll in the dental school at Northwestern University.[9] He did well academically, but said that he """"didn't like spit all that much"""".[10] He switched his focus to business after three years,[11] and received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971. After graduating, he took a job with an accounting firm but quit to join the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. Hanssen left the department after two years, joining the FBI in January 1976.[7]

Hanssen met Bernadette """"Bonnie"""" Wauck while he was attending dental school in Chicago. Bonnie was one of eight children from a staunchly Roman Catholic family. The couple married in 1968. After Hanssen married, he converted from Lutheranism to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in Opus Dei.
[edit] Early FBI career and first espionage activities (1979–1981)

Hanssen joined the FBI as a special agent on 12 January 1976 and was transferred to the field office in Gary, Indiana. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to New York when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.[12] The next year, Hanssen was moved into counter-intelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the Bureau. It was then, in 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, that Hanssen began his career as a Soviet, and later a Russian, spy.

That year, Hanssen approached the GRU (the Soviet military intelligence agency) and offered his services. Hanssen never indicated any political or ideological motive for his activities, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was the money.[13] During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on FBI bugging activities and Bureau lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak of information was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, code named TOPHAT. Polyakov was a CIA informant for more than twenty years before his retirement in 1980, and passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the Soviet Army. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act on their intelligence about Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, but Hanssen's role remained unknown until after his arrest in 2001.[14]

Hanssen was nearly exposed in 1981, when Bonnie Hanssen caught her husband in their basement writing a letter to the Soviets. Hanssen admitted to her that he'd been giving information to the Soviets (motivated purely by his """"need"""" for money) and that he had received US$30,000 as payment, but he lied and said that he was only passing along false intelligence. Knowing this, Bonnie insisted that her husband go to confession, as is required in the Roman Catholic faith for those who have committed serious sins. The Opus Dei priest who allegedly heard Robert's confession is said to have told him to give the money to charity as an act of penance. This remains unconfirmed as under the Seal of Confession, “it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner for any reason"""" (Canon 983.1) under penalty of """"latae sententiae excommunication” (Canon 1388.1). Hanssen told his wife that he gave the money to Mother Teresa, but it is unknown if he actually did so.[15] Hanssen then stopped spying for the Soviet Union until 1985.

Confused
Don't worry but I think somebody got confused while usign LHD and RHD back and forth beetwen different countries, so for example, Spain is LHD or RHD? the part about Gibraltar made me get confused about it.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.226.204.140   

Gibraltar has not been part of Spain since 1713, so the British authorities applied their own laws, including the rule of the road. By 1929, driving on on the left while having a land border with a country that drove on the right became impractical, so that's why Gibraltar change on 16 June of that year.  

History
Do we have any reliable evidence about the historic foundations of LHD/RHD are? I think the article could benefit from adding any info to this effect.
On numerous occasions, I have heard that left hand driving has its roots in knights passing each other with the lances in their right hand. However, i have never been able to find any evidence of this. 
  

-Please do excuse me for sounding a bit daft, but I'm not sure I understand the question. Isn't that what the entire article is about? In addition, I think the problems ascertaining the specific history are quite well-presented.   

Sweden
Under Safety factors it says
""""Research in 1969 by J. J. Leeming showed countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right. This research is questioned in Peter Kincaid's book on the rule of the road,[citation needed] but some countries that have switched to driving on the right, such as Sweden, have seen their long-term accident rates increase by more than any increase in traffic volume[citation needed]."""" The red part is totally made up, and the opposite is the truth. The number of accidents was cut in half from the first day of right hand driving, and has not increased substantually since then. Swedish right hand driver 83.255.35.43  

H'm. This what you're saying doesn't quite make sense, either. The number of crashes will surely have gone up since 1967. Perhaps you mean the crash rate (per vehicle-kilometre travelled, per thousand vehicles registered, etc.) has declined, which would make sense since that's what's been happening in just about every first-world country over the last four decades. 

Nevertheless, the assertion you call attention to is unsupported, has been for quite some time, and at the very least is questionable. We can remove it from the article unless/until someone cares to add it back with reliable support. — T·C

If anyone else has found this already and beaten me to it, I'm sorry to be redundant. After a long night of trolling the internet for hours I finally came across the holy grail of Dagen H-related video. Here's the link.

The site also hosts (further down) the news bulletins for the various anniversaries right up to 1997.

""":::::From the diffeology article: """"Differentiable manifolds also generalize smoothness. They are normally defined as topological manifolds with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure"""" (emphasis mine).  The point is not whether differentiable manifolds can be defined without an atlas (I already pointed out that they can also be defined with sheaves), but that the classical definition that most mathematicians are still using is the atlas definition. Markus is correct that the choice of an atlas for a topological manifold doesn't matter, but to be a manifold I will contend that it must have some atlas. Defining the sphere as a set of zeroes is implicitly embedding the sphere into another space. It has already been pointed out several times that a topological sphere does not have a unique differentiable manifold structure. How is the differentiable manifold structure induced by the embedding, and (more to the point) how can one understand the corresponding differentiable manifold structure on a topological sphere without mentioning this embedding? Topological spaces are not equipped with embeddings a priori. That a sphere with a differentiable manifold structure has a topological embedding into euclidean space does not at all imply that the differentiable structure was induced by this embedding. -

Clearly, DZ, you're as well read on Biblical scholarship as I am. While I respect your learning, I must point out that the historicity of Esther is interesting, but tangential to this discussion. The article specifies texts """"referenced by, but not found in, the Bible."""" Whether anyone finds Esther ahistorical doesn't impact the fact that Esther is part of the Bible, and therefore, books described therein qualify for this article.

To pick over the list with esoteric debates about whether any or all of the bible is ahistorical is probably a worthwhile article, but the discussion doesn't go HERE. This article has a simple definition: If the reference is in the Tanakh, the reference belongs on the list. 

Secondly, I strongly disagree with using the preposition """"in."""" Using """"in"""" WOULD imply canonicity; using """"of"""" implies only that they're described by the Bible. 

Lest this discussion turn nasty, and since you and I are apparently the only people obsessed by the topic , perhaps we could reach a scholarly consensus of our own: If you want to go to the dedicated pages for the Esther-referenced texts and carefully note the historicity debate there, I won't get into a revert war. By the same token, I would appreciate your making a concession on the prepositions used in the title of this article, and allowing me to redirect the fragmentary NCBRITB here without further ado.

I feel your behaviour on this matter is bordering on inappropriate, specifically that you are assuming an authority on dictating procedure that is not in any way supported by policy.

The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.

 re: Intermediawiki linking 

re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).

I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal. ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''

Mike I be putting this whole section in WT:TSP, but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta, and much of our 'good stuff' is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well (Omegatron, CBD, etc.) But here people know me and so this is where it began. Like David, RL called (demanded!) and I went wiki-missing much of last fall, and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wiki's, then iterwikitmp-grp hit Tfd... so that boot in the rear restarted things. I'd really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons! Sigh... life is not a selection of first choices, most of the time we're lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen!  I'll address your points on WT:TSP. But thanks for the interest and input. I like that idea of intersister interwiki's! As for 'What I'm doing', the WP:TSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it. This is really a local need as much as one off in the smaller sister's though Wikispecies and Wikiversity much need template expertise and libraries.  ttfn // nkB """,0

     OK, to be fair, I could have more properly identified the photo in question as a """"promotional photograph"""" - an oversight which has been corrected.

     As far as your hurt feelings go, it doesn't matter if you're an editor - hell, it don't matter if you're the damn founder of Wikipedia itself; to just go in and start making major changes to articles which you have had no part in authoring, without any advance discussion, is just plain rude.

Deleting my page Ahontoay was not necessary. I read the reason for the page's deletion and the following may help you learn more information about this group of non treaty Montana Chippewa Indians. You claimed you searched for anything about Ahontoay on wikipedia. You can try searching by using the name Ahonteways but it won't work. Search by using the phrase User:Linniebc/SandBox. That will quickly lead you to the wikipedia page with A-Hon-Te-Ways. Though the phrase is a wikipedia's contributor's name, it is the only way you'll find it. That is the only wikipedia page with that name. The Ahontoay are a non federally recognized group of Chippewa's in Montana. The United States has no jurisdiction over them. 

The only way to find out about this group of non treaty Chippewa's, is by using google or another search engine. Google Ahontoay and you will find that the name is spelt as Ahontoay. The wikipedia page spells it as Ahonteways, which is not the correct way of spelling the chiefs name on the historical records i have found on the internet. Don't get the two names Ahontoay and Ahonteways, mixed up. They are not two different peoples but the same people. Chief Ahontoay did not take treaty. He never lived on a Reservation which proves he refused to cooperate with the United States. You will have to deal with the obvious difference in name spelling.

CPL, I'd like to review the Chessmetrics discussion at Proj Chess page, you're making several assertions, and not knowing the background vis-a-vis Chessmetrics, can't form an opinion whether I think you're right or not. But I do think at this point you are incorrect in what you state about some of the content you've been removing from articles (more than what you said). Also, I don't undrstand why you are removing content, like matches and match records, based on """"I can't find it and it wasn't sourced"""". (You should be using {{citation needed}} tag for that, rather than wholescale immediate deletion.) How do you suppose that content got there in the first place? (It seems there are three possibilities: 1) someone had a source they didn't identify, 2) someone had a source but got something mixed up, or 3) they invented it out of their head.) In any case, the thing to do is tag it and give the editor time to source it.

I have no interest or desire to """"argue"""" with you, CPL. But when I see what are IMO bogus arguments intended to be the basis for removal of contents (be they article content, categories, whole articles via AfD), then I'm bound to express my thought which might counter your opinions. When you tried to stick words in Fischer's mouth he never said regarding his strength compared to Morphy's, an effort which ended up opposed by me & Quale and which you proved by contacting the author was taken out of context by you, you challenged me why I would """"nit-pick even the slightest of [your] edits"""". I ended up protecting the article, did't I? (And, you violated policy understanding & execution of WP:BRD also, unacknowleged by you.) When you tried to insist an incendiary, accusatory Youtube video should be included in Dawn Marie Psaltis BLP, in violation of WP:BLPREMOVE, you reverted an IP user who removed the material calling the IP's removal an act of vandalism, and you reverted me (edit-warred) even though you were in the wrong about BLP policy and again dismissing the Talk I opened with edit summary explaining the material was a violation of BLP policy and please see Talk, since you reverted me without first going to Talk. Once again I helped protect that article (and Wikipedia since it was a BLP), against your efforts to compromise it. 

So you see, CPL, I have no interest in """"arguing"""" with you or even engaging in debate with you. I've seen how you argue your points, and I thoroughly disagree with your tactics, and many times your logic.

 Lesbian and Dyke (slang) articles  

Hello, Lionhead99. If you have checked the edit history of the Lesbian article before, which I believe that you have, you will see that your edits were reverted twice at that article, once by , with me elaborating on Wikiwind's revert for why your edits were reverted, and now by me. Those edit summaries clearly explain why you were reverted. Waiting a month later to restore most of it does not change the issue with your edit. It's not like most people who were watching an article stop watching it a month later and aren't going to notice what is mostly the same change that they objected to before. 

As I've stated, the lead isn't saying that being lesbian is a choice; it's saying whether or not to identify as lesbian is a choice; sexual identity is not always the same as sexual orientation, which I explained to a different person in September of this year on the Lesbian talk page. Your edits, among other things, removed material that addresses the important ways that the term """"lesbian"""" is used, material that is partly a summary of the Sexuality and lesbian identity section. Per WP:LEAD, the lead is supposed to """"summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies."""" Partially because """"lesbian"""" is often not consistently defined in the same way by women who use the term to describe their sexuality, it often is not consistently defined in the same way by researchers (see page 22). The Lesbian article is a big article; so it, of course, makes sense that its lead is four paragraphs, which is the advised limit for the lead. Leads may or may not include sources, as what is in the lead should be sourced in the lower body of the article and since sourcing the lead is a case-by-case matter. See Wikipedia:Lead#Citations. And WP:OVERLINKING is not good.

It should also help that  changed the """"About""""/disambiguation tag to identify that this article is not just about sexual orientation: """"This article is about the term Lesbian and female homosexuality. For the sexual orientation in general, see Homosexuality.""""

I also reverted you at the Dyke (slang) article, because, """"The term is not always pejorative anymore, as the lead notes. 'Dyke' is used very often among gay and bisexual-identified women without negative connotation. 'Sissy' or 'faggot' not as much to the same extent by gay men.""""   """,0

 It's OK, we've resolved it and found a solution.  Nick will post edit requests so that other members can use the source instead.  A bit like an insider giving the scoop so that we can be as near-accurate with the article as possible.  If that makes sense?   Mᴥuse """,0

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

The seal of all prophets who was above the rank and station of Jesus, Abraham, and Moses? These people are very offensive. In response, I am creating a criticism of Jesus section. Jesus of Nazareth (the Christian version) has plenty of, indeed countless, criticism.

Therefore, I demand that you stop from adding images of the holy Prophet Muhammad's (phuh) beautiful and holy face.

Fact: The majority of soldiers serving in the Rhodesian Army at the time of the bush war were black.
Fact: The ZIPRA/ZANLA """"forces"""" never overcame the Rhodesian forces, the majority of internal engagements were short, sharp firefights, the usual result being either the complete annihilation, or dispersal of the terrorist groups involved. The external engagements, or camp attacks always resulted in overwhelming victories for the Rhodesian forces.
Fact: ZIPRA/ZANLA were both left wing organisations, with full backing from far-left Marxists states. 
Fact: ZIPRA/ZANLA """"forces"""" deployed within Rhodesia preferred to not engage the Rhodesian armed forces, and this was also not their role, as operating in small groups of up to 20 men, without any form of air support, they could not take on the security on anything approaching equal terms. They were deployed primarily to """"politicise"""" the rural black population (usually by terrorising those who did not fully support of their parent organisation into doing so), and to destabilise the economy as much as possible by attacking soft targets. 
Fact: Neither ZIPRA or ZANLA overcame (as you put it) the Rhodesian army. Possibly the conventionally trained ZIPRA troops who were held back in Zambia, and never committed to the bush war, could have defeated the Rhodesian forces in open battle, considering that towards the end of the war these conventionally trained troops were far better equipped than the Rhodesian forces, but as Nkomo never gave the go order, we will never know.

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

Enter Batwoman
This character made her debut in Detective Comics #233 (July 1956), written by Edmond Hamilton and illustrated by Sheldon Moldoff. It seems clear that her introduction was part of a publishing decision to alter the ambiance of the series. Memories are vague on this point, but the responsibility may have rested with DC publisher Harry Donenfeld's son Irwin. After Whitney Ellsworth moved to California to produce a Superman television series, Irwin Donenfeld was serving as de facto editor in chief.

 Bot automation at Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement 

Over the past two weeks, there has been extensive discussion on introducing bot automation to assist with maintenance of the Today's Articles for Improvement project. A  has now been approved for trial and will carry out the weekly duties. The bots first run will occur around ' (midnight on Sunday).If you have been assisting any of the weekly maintenance tasks, please refrain from doing so this week. The bot needs to be tested and proven it can do the job, and it only gets one chance per week. The tasks will include:
 Adding the new scheduled article to Wikipedia talk:Today's articles for improvement and removing the entry from Wikipedia:Articles for improvement
 Set up the schedule pages for the new TAFI, except the adding of an image and caption
 Adding  to the new article for improvement, remove  from last week's article and add  to the talk page
 Notify relevant WikiProjects that the new TAFI is within their scope
 Send a mass message to everyone on the notification list of the new TAFI selection

Updating the accomplishments and archiving selections is still done manually, along with daily' tasks such as adding approved entries to the articles for improvement page. These will become automated in the near future.

We hope the bot proves to serve well, and by carrying out the routine housekeeping tasks we can boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the project.  thanks you for your service in helping with the weekly tasks in the past, and for your cooperation during this trial period )

At a nationaly televised event honoring him a few weeks before he died, Davis said """"First of all, I want to thank Jesus for letting me be here tonight"""", completely shattering any doubt he had any lingering affinty to Satanism.

 Encore a mistake in interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

You made a serious mistake in interpretation, which seems normal for those who are not specialists in entomology and taxonomy in the dipterous ones.  But, please show me once again that I make an attack with the person of Rognes, because I must explain you where you did not understand.  

In your correct information for the articles of your Wikipedia, you must read and analyze all the bibliographical data and to understand well the problems of a taxon or a group of let us taxa.  Thus, you can note that Rognes is the only amateur faunist (and not a recognized specialist), who wishes to make """" revolutions """" in taxonomy, without knowing Bengaliidae, without knowing the morphology of dipterous (in general), without being able to make a correct identification according to the male genitalia even of usual Calliphoridae.  In more he wanted to introduce an aberrant and specific terminology for his pupils of the school of handicappers of Stavanger (Norway) where he works, and was unaware of always the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.  All its """" research """" is not recognized by the community of the specialists.  Only his friends of the same structure, namely:  Thomas Pape (the recognized intellectual robber and the most stupid taxonomist nowadays), C Thompson, N.L. Evenhuis, J.E. O' Hara and (unfortunately) A. C. Pont wrote a bibliographical work, nonscientific, in which they mentioned exactly what I have says to you before on Rognes.  He cannot identify any species of Bengaliidae and he does not have competence to establish that Bengalia testacea  is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  This false type was mentioned before by Sabrosky in a stupid work of bibliography (nonscientific), in collaboration with the same ignoramuses collaborators (1999:62).  You must know exactly that of Zumpt until Lehrer, the species-type of the Bengalia kind is Bengalia labiata R.D. - not B testacea sensu Duponchel 1842 & Rognes, which is a nomen nudum. 

Thus, for the exactitude of your encyclopaedic information you must change distort them given.  Moreover, I give you the council of reading certain articles documented by Lehrer in Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2010, 23: 1-`22 and 22-25;  24:16-20 and 20-23;  26:  21-30 [ [ http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Z._Lehrer ] ] and the work: LEHRER& WEI, 2010, Un nouveau genre oriental de la famille Bengaliidae (Diptera), Bull.

I'll start with the basics: spacecraft are very expensive. They can only send a few out of earth orbit (where they have no ability to generate income like earth sattelite spacecraft) every so often. For various reasons they place the few spacecraft that can be afforded in equatorial orbitsmainly because they can't afford to send out 1 spacecraft for each planet, so they have to keep the sattelite orbiting in the solar plain so it can be sent to another planet later. From equatorial orbits there is only one way to take a picture of the polesfrom the side! Even though the picture looks like it is one shot from the top, it is actually several shots from the side and put together to make it look like its one shot from the top. In order to make it look like its taken from the top, they have to correct for the fact that its actually taken from the side. The very top just becomes a gross stretched out mess.

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

"What a hypocrite this creep Chavez is!

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1

Dai, ydych chi'n siarad Cymraeg? I love that language. I studied it a long time ago, but unfortunately I've forgotten most of it. Let's see, what were you asking? If I have considered checking my edits? And you were informing me about the """"Show preview"""" box? Ha-ha-ha! Very funny. Have you considered checking how long a user has been on Wikipedia and how many edits he's made before asking that question? So, here is some information for you: User:Daicaregos, First edit: Apr 21, 2008, Unique articles edited: 533. User:Pasquale, First edit: Jun 24, 2004, Unique articles edited: 1,461. As you can see, I've been on the Wikipedia for five and a half years. And, yes, I always use """"Show preview"""" function.

However, I did screw up when I undid your edit, because, when I compared the two versions, all I could see was the removal of the Union Jack . Of course, your Edit summary said """"Repair Wikilink, tidy"""", so I suspected there was something else I wasn't seeing, but, much as I stared, I could not see the link fix. (Needless to say, when I went back now, I saw it right away.)

Look, if I could vote for Welsh independence tomorrow, I would do it. I'm all for it. Ditto for all the other unrepresented nationalities. But what I can't stand is when people take their nationalistic battles to the Wikipedia. Is Wales one of the United Kingdom's constituent countries, whether one likes it or not? I noticed you did not remove that part, so I must conclude you agree. But you chose to remove the flagicon and referred to that particular edit as """"tidy""""! (Again, very funny, not to mention a little tricky.) Well that flagicon is also shown next to England and Scotland in the List of country name etymologies, so in order to """"tidy"""" up the whole article you should remove it in all three places! But you didn't. Hence the inconsistency.

Frankly, I don't understand where you find the cheek to refer to my restoration of the previous status quo as """"removing edits I just don't like"""" and as a """"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response"""". Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous and disingenuous. Now, having said that, let me join you in saying Cymru am byth!    

Hi Pasquale, ydw. Dw'n siarad Cymraeg, diolch. I've moved your reply here for two reasons. 1. to keep it in one place. 2. to remove the union flag from my talk page (and you call my edits tricky and disingenuous). Glad you enjoyed my joke. I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found """"the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as """"removing edits [you] just don't like"""" and as a """"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response"""".""""

 New review articles on human population genetics based on studies of ancient DNA 

Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth. I've been reading university textbooks on human genetics """"for fun"""" since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. The  Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources. 

The guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that """"it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge."""" 

The guidelines, consistent with the  general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all """"Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources"""" (emphasis in original). They helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that """"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves."""" 

Two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetics are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human DNA, including DNA from ancient individuals. 

Earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples (fewer genes, and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times). As more samples of more genes from more individuals from more places and times are gathered, the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the Earth's surface and mixing genes over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human homeland in Africa.

 God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  

The article states that """"The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.""""  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations.  However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the """"world that was"""".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.

NIV:

Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

KJV:

 Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Now, the English word """"formless"""" in the NIV and the english words """"without form"""" in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu, G/K Number H9332 and Strong's Number H8414.  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as """"to lie waste"""" or simply """"waste.""""  

Likewise, the english word """"empty"""" in the NIV and the english word """"void"""" in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu, G/K Number H983 and Strong's Number H922.  Strong's Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.

Consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ """"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.""""

Furthermore, Bullinger's observations continue to, and link 2Pe3:6, which states (KJV) 2Pe3:6 """"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.""""  Bullinger believes that this is a reference to Ge1:1-2, and not the flood during Noah's time.  He concludes with """"The creation in eternity past, to which all fossils and remains belong.""""  (Companion Bible, page 3).

Consequently, the articles should include, in my opinion, the fact that some theologians reject the young Earth on literal grounds.

See the Bullinger's side notes [].

Also, a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters [] with Bullinger.  

To summarize:  The article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the Bible do not think the Earth is roughly 6000 years old.   Vacuous Poet""",0
"""

Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: """"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment."""" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12. 

Brunton's beginning point is that: """"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance."""" 

I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is """"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks"""" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The """"spiritual bypass"""" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ. 

So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case. All I ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic.   """,0

Listen: there were 350,000 Germans in Vojvodina before the war, and about 250,000 of them left from the region together with the withdrawal German army, before partisans took control of the region. The remaining 100,000 were the subject for persecution. Also, it is not quite correct that those 250,000 fled the partisans, but they fled the Soviet Red Army. Partisans came after Red Army (or together with it at least). Also, it is the main difference between Germans and Jews, since most of the Jews were killed or deported during the war, while most of the Germans escaped before they could became a subject for persecutions. Second thing, during the war, Serbs also were persecuted and thousands of them were held in prison camps or expelled. The only difference between Germans and Serbs here is that Serbs returned to their homes after the war, and Germans did not. So, is that difference a good reason to write here only about persecuted Germans and not about persecuted Serbs too? It is good that you said that the one who want to know who were partisans should to read the """"Partisans"""" article, because the one who want to know more why Germans fled should to read Danube Swabians article.

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

The countries were illegally annexed, and there is a considerable difference between de facto and de jure; if I steal your car and then forge the title, it may be """"my car"""" in that I drive it, register it, paint it hot pink and invite my relatives to live in it, but a Wikipedia article on the matter would probably best be entitled """"Theft of Dojarco's car.""""  The article on O.J. Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the """"lameness"""" of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this. It's a frequent search term. One includes denial in the Holocaust entry, and there are separate entries on Holocaust denial and even Criticism of Holocaust denial  but this does not mean that we agree with Holocaust denial, does it? The occupation of the Baltic States is not universally agreed upon, no  but not too many things are universally agreed upon. Presenting the prevailing view and serious alternate views is what an encyclopedia is supposed to do. You write: Saying Baltics were not annexed is pure nonsence and extremist POV. Nobody here said that the Baltics weren't annexed  what some here are saying is that they were illegally annexed whilst under occupation, and that is indeed the prevailing view. Please follow the links I gave. That some are in denial really does not matter. Start an article on """"Denial of the occupation of the Baltic States"""" if you like.  09:05""",0

Response Thank you for your concern. However, from where I sit, it isn't my """"good faith"""" that is at issue here. It's the good faith of the AfD initiator and his fellow instigators that is at issue. After all, I didn't write the CTMU article. Tim Smith did, and I don't know Mr. Smith from Adam. 

Suffice it to say that I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgable regarding the topic of that article, and rather than let Wikipedia readers be deceived, disinformed, and otherwise steered wrong about it, feel a responsibility to edit any part of it which I know to be erroneous or malicious in nature. All of my edits to date have satisfied this criterion.

Needless to say, that includes some of those involved in this AfD.

 Should Robespierre be classified as a liberal? 

As per the articles on more controversial topics such as fascism and Marxism-Leninism, I have noticed that they address the controversies involved in the ideology such as the Holocaust and the Great Purge - it is not POV to address these because they are important parts of history of the ideology. However the controversial elements of the French Revolution seem to be minimalized here - especially in regard to Robespierre.

When I added a picture of Robespierre, a user removed it, and claimed that it was doubtful where Robespierre was a liberal and claims that the Reign of Terror was not liberal. First of all, I believe a strong argument can be made that demonstrates that Robespierre being a Jacobin upheld many classical liberal values - albeit in a contorted way like Stalin's sociopathic version of Marxism. In Robespierre: The Voice of Virtue, that seeks to describe Robespierre not merely as a tyrant but as a man with genuine beliefs, it describes Robespierre as being a proponent of universal suffrage, of being an abolitionist (seeking to end slavery). Robespierre was part of a revolution that was associated with many classical liberal goals. Robespierre's Reign of Terror against the Girondists and counter-revolutionaries (both real and suspected) that was pursued according to Robespierre to solidify the revolution. Historian Francois Furet claims the Reign of Terror was deeply ideologically rooted in the idea of promoting """"man's regeneration"""" based on free will and enlightenment, that the Committee of Public Safety promoted that resulted in violence against people suspected of being counterrevolutionaries. The issue of Robespierre's association with liberalism - if he was a liberal or if he was not a liberal - needs to be investigated further here by other users, because regardless of Robespierre's controversies he was an important figure in the Jacobin movement and the French Revolution.

 Problem in gallery and request for this article to be moved 

A lot of people in the image gallery are represented as Tajiks while this is not true. Ferodwsi was born in Iran, therefore he could not have been Tajik. Secondly Rabia Balkhi was of Arab descent therefore she could not have been of Tajik descent either. Lastly, why is Muhammad of Ghori included in the gallery of Tajiks? He was not Taik, the ghorids themselves were believed to be Pashtuns and they were NOT native speakers of the Persian language rather patronizers of the culture. There seems to be a lot of vandalism and propaganda being posted by Tajiks here themselves, with no evidence being provided.

I have not placed any cites as I did not write the section originally. What I think we can do is, go from here, place in the relevent cite requests, and attempt to clean up this section. NOTES- (1)I left in the last sentence of the first paragraph. While it might be seen as """"original research"""" it is a fact, I'd prefer to let it go with a cite request to at least give someone else a chance to make it better. (2)I left in the last three paragraphs which you think don't deserve attention, however it is true, and this behavior definitely deserves attention in a """"comments and criticisms"""" section. I think the problem here is that it is not a clean section. The current wording certainly is of an axe grinding nature, but can be cleaned up and sourced to become good information. Here is the original section I've pulled from-
Personally, I prefer this info to be integrated into the article more seamlessly, but I have accepted """"comments/criticism"""" sections as a necessary part of these types of articles as there tends to be no other way to share this information without damaging the integrity of the article. Insertion of information regarding Hitler's abuse of drugs after his assasination attempt, or Exxon's treatment of the Valdez incident, and subsequent hand wringing over the suit, to all be examples of pertinent info regarding individuals and companies that can easily be perverted to a non-objective position, but are still highly valuable when done correctly.
So this done, let's all take it easy. Those who think it is a poor section please leave it and place in your cite requests. Those who think it deserves to stay can work to find those cites and clean it up. This can and will become a good section if we let it be and allow for the open source machine to work it's magic.

 What Makes a Person Notable? 

After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's """"Notable People"""" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him """"famous"""" as well as detractors who consider him """"infamous"""".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   """,0

Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18. Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. 

Yeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010. I remembered riding one of those D40LF buses on line 115, when SB-5 used to operate that line, shared by SB-18,  which currently owns the line.

"URGENT RE: SECTION DELETED

As per advice from several relevant authorities, I have deleted the offending paragraph in the Temple Lot article, and the identical one at 'Church of Christ Temple Lot.'   I am not doing this as an amateur Wikipedia editor, but as the private citizen who is being 'outed' and defamed in two Wikipedia articles (so far).   I have been advised to delete the offending passage, and then wait and see who exactly restores it. That person (unless it is a SmackBot, an automatic revert), will in turn be 'outed' and 'named' as the subject of a criminal investigation.  Yes, this is a 'legal threat,' and I don't appreciate various inept Wikipedia administrators threatening me in order to dissuade me from complaining to law enforcement about a crime which is being committed: the willful invasion of privacy, and defamation of a U.S. Citizen, in contravention to numerous local, state, and federal laws, as well as in contravention to numerous strict and explicit Wikipedia policies regarding inclusion of a person's name in a Wikipedia article. The following excerpt is just one example of Wikipedia guidelines which have been willfully, persistently and openly ignored and defied by Wikipedia editor after Wikipedia editor.  Again...whoever restores the defamatory passage which includes my nameor ANY paragraph, sentence or article which includes my namewill be investigated and [hopefully] prosecuted for doing so. In other words, I WILL PRESS CRIMINAL CHARGES against the perpetrator.

Privacy of names

Caution should be applied when naming individuals who are discussed primarily in terms of a single event. When the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed (such as in certain court cases), it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. When evaluating the inclusion or removal of names, their publication in secondary sources other than news media, such as scholarly journals or the work of recognized experts, should be afforded greater weight than the brief appearance of names in news stories.

Editors should take particular care when considering whether inclusion of the names of private, living individuals who are not directly involved in an article's topic adds significant value. The presumption in favor of the privacy of family members of articles' subjects and other loosely involved persons without independent notability is correspondingly stronger.",0

"MSU Interview 

Dear Feezo,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0

And of course, most of those alternative explanations will fail those and other requirements. 
It certainly can be amusing to try to construct alternative theories to explain this evidence. And amusing to try to come up with more evidence. It is all good mental exercise I would commend to anyone. How many scientific facts/observations/pieces of evidence can one come up with to """"prove"""" the earth is round ? (I use prove loosely here, since there is no proof in science only in mathematics and logic). 

One caution I have, is that some of these explanations are clever. Some are just silly, like saying the earth is not warmer now than it was 100 years ago. However, the measurements are the measurements. And even when all kinds of corrections are taken acount of, the temperatures now are warmer than they were 100 years ago. Done using thousands of instruments of different types in different locations by different people who got consistent results. Incorrect theories are bad enough, but bad data is fatal. 

As to your other questions, it is easy to measure the earth's free oscillations with a weight on a spring. It is done all the time and has been done for decades. And they have very characteristic temporal and spatial frequencies corresponding to oscillations of a rotating sphere. A bit hard to wave your hands to make those observations go away. You might be able to do it if you were really an excellent applied mathematician and willing to spend a few months in crazy speculative inverse theory computations. Currents of course are possible, but these are very special kinds of currents that have special kinds of characteristics that match what one would expect from a fluid on a rotating spherical earth. I have personally seen the curve of the earth when standing on a very high point. Now of course it could be an optical illusion, but it is a very compelling one if it is. However you can put it down to refraction or some other optical effect. In fact, you could even put photographs of the earth from space down to those. As I said above (and you nicely demonstrated my point), you can explain almost ANYTHING away and maintain some pre-conceived notion if you are willing to throw away parsimony and the demands of prediction, etc. """,0

"Please view my video and pass it on to your friends and colleagues. The more viewers I get, will support my case in the court of public opinion and pressure the three involved companies, Chrysler, Compuware d/b/a Professional Services, and Combustion Components to settle my 11 year homelessness.

Search: Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

the following official losses ( the data quoted by Overy) Killed in Action and dead of wounds
6,330,000; non combat deaths 556,000. Those are confirmed losses reported to the high command by the fronts. Estimated MIA were 500,000 and estimated POW dead 1.3 million. The grand total was 8.6 million. What a coincidence that this is exactly the same as Axis losses of 8.6 million as reported in Kirosheev. The USSR losses were equal to the Axis on the Eastern front, right or wrong? Pow loses were 1.3 million, right or wrong? Check your numbers before you make a change. 
Real losses of Pows were about 2.8 million and MIA were 500,000. Add that to 6.9 million confirmed dead and you are at 10.4 million. That does not include losses of Partisans and Milita of 400,000 ( they must be included as military not civilian losses). Berndd",0

 classical optics part 2 

i hate to say this but i think everyone has completely misunderstood what i am tryint to do.

i am just trying to give a clear picture to the reader of the beginings and then move on to the other sections, i have no intention at all of changing the structure of the article. the article begins very clearly with the """"classical optics"""" part that describes how light was considered before the wave model. the problem our current presentation is that the wave model is right in the begining, this is a bit strange.

that is why i arranged the article such that you had the classical optics and its further explanation in geometrical optics, then wave modeln then comparison to quantum optics and finally modern optics. in other words nothing in the article changed except for the position.
copper i feel that in the sources you have shown they are considering classical optics as the entire thing which is both the particle and wave model. however what i am doing is showing the beginning of optics. there are other google hits that take classical optics purely as the earlier concepts before the introduction of wave model but anyway there is no point of going through them and listing them. one google book on fourier optics does not mention the word """"electromagnetism"""" till page 365! different terminology i guess. anyway 

i feel that we cant put the wave model in the beginning, it just would not make any sense. its like we are skipping everything and landing on maxwells equations which happened much later. the current form is ok. 

it follows a good pattern - classical, geometrical, wave model, comparison with quantum optics finally modern optics.""",0

 defaultsort is your friend! 

Hello! I noticed your edit to Mikael Odenberg, so I thought I should drop by and tell you about the wonders of {{DEFAULTSORT}}.

A sortkey is an alternative term the article should be sorted by when listed in a category. For example to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category """"people"""" and have the article sorted by """"Einstein, Albert"""". You would type """"[[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]]"""". This kind of sortkey you successfully added to Mikael Odenberg in your edit.

But, I reverted most of your edit! Why? Because there is a feature called """"Default sort key"""", which changes the default sort key used by categories from the name of the article to the one specified with the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT}}. Instead of adding |Odenberg, Mikael you simply add  {{DEFAULTSORT:Odenberg, Mikael}} above the categories, which I had already done in this case.

Thank you for your otherwise very valuable contribution!  (Talk ° contribs)

 Chemsitry Comments 
I have noticed that you seem to spend a lot of time commenting on chemistry articles, claiming that they need to be either put in context or wikified. I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - 

Hello! Eh. Lately I've indeed been editing chemistry articles; BUT only to remove improper categories (such as those you added to, well, a damn lot of articles). Using AutoWikiBrowser. On some, tags such as {{wikify}} have been posted, but not many. I may have edited one or two chemical reaction stubs, but I don't know which ones. Point out more specifically which articles you refer to and I'll see what I can do. Do note, however, that my knowledge of chemistry is extremely basic, and my contributions to chemistry articles have only been clean-up/maintenance work.  (Talk ° contribs) 

Its okay. I'm a qualified chemist, but you seem to be suggesting for example on the Bechamp Reaction that more detail is needed. To me it seems clear. Also on the category front, they were not incorrectly labelled. I have been putting them into the topmost category they can go into so as to create a list of all the chemists that appear on wikipedia. This is because it is otherwise hard to see who may or may not need to be added. I have been finding your editting very unhelpful in removing them from this category.

Law is meant to take the most unbiased approach possible yet some wikipedia editors belive otherwise and will unedit posts that they believe to be against wikipedias laws. Take for example:

By deleting this section of post will show that wikipedia does not have a """"Neutral point of view"""" at all and isnt a open for valid and correct information if it goes against something to do with wikipedia.

"YES MA'AM 

The Delphic Oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. The Pythia, the priestess presiding over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by Apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century BC.[11] It is often said that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of Apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in Greek literature. Other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the Pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice.[12] The Pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. The last recorded response was given in 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I ordered pagan temples to cease operation. Recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia's state of inspiration.[13]

One of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of Michel de Nostredame (1503 – 1566), often Latinized to Nostradamus, published during the French Renaissance period. Nostradamus was a French apothecary and seer who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide and have rarely been out of print since his death. He is best known for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Taken together, his written works are known to have contained at least 6,338 quatrains or prophecies,[14] as well as at least eleven annual calendars. Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles – all undated.

Nostradamus is a controversial figure. His many enthusiasts, as well as the popular press, credit him with predicting many major world events. Interest in his work is still considerable, especially in the media and in popular culture. By contrast, most academic scholars maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus' quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.[15]",0

I think it is quite likely that Vlachs refer to themselves as """"Vlachs"""" when dealing with Serbs, since this is the term that Serbs generally refer to them, but that in their own communities, they are """"români"""" (and that they do not declare Romanian on the census either because they see themselves as separate from the Romanian nation-state or because the believe that """"Vlach"""" is the name of their ethnicity in Serbia - in the same way that Roma may declare themselves """"gypsies""""; the first option is more likely).  ' ✉ 

I agree that we should include both names. I know that some Vlachs refer to themselves as Rumani in their language, but I am not sure that all of them use this name for themselves. It would be the best that we know names which Vlachs use for themselves in their own language/dialect. I read that Vlach language even had its own script based on the Greek script some 200-300 years ago, but today Vlach have no written form and Vlachs use either standard Romanian either Serbian for writing.  (talk) 

Without a doubt in their own tongue the Vlachs say they speak Romanian (rumanesce). There is no such thing as 'vlahesce'.

Whether the Vlachs are Romanian is essentially a political, not an ethnic question. Ethnically they are Romanian. 

However they have lived for two centuries under Serbian rule. During this time they lost religious services and schooling in their own language, which many used to have before 1830. The Serbian government and Serbian Orthodox Church have been applying a systematic and unrelenting program of assimilation.
For Vlachs Romanian personal names were forbidden by the Orthodox Church and this prohibition continues to this day. Last names (family names) were created by edict in the late 19th century throughout Serbia since they didn't exist before. All last names had to take the form ending in 'ic', usually using the father's name as the root. For most Vlachs this concealed their non Serb origin, though certain glaring exceptions continue, for example: Floric, Jepurovic, St[a]ngacilovic, etc.

The majority of Vlachs (some 300,000) do not consider themselves Romanian, but Serbian. To a large extent this is because they do not wish to be seen as unpatriotic or disloyal. In addition, since they have no education in their own tongue, many believe that modern culture cannot be expressed in their native tongue.

It is meaningless to point to official Serbian statistics about the 'Vlach' tongue or the number of Vlach speakers. Too many Vlachs suffer from the Stockholm Syndrome:

Why is ISO code:none; ISO 639 code: none; Ethnologue code: none) constantly deleted? I see no objection in having this text as above.  

Because if there isn't any ISO, ISO 639, and Ethnologue code, what's the point of mentioning it? — 

 Chinese term 

Ni-hao! The Chinese word """"luómǎníyàyǔ"""" means """"Romanian"""" (not """"Vlach""""), and I don't see what the point of linking it here is. Vlachs are not a recognised ethnic group in China and the """"Vlach language of Serbia"""" is not spoken there significantly (if at all!). Thanks,  ' ✉ 

The chinese word was added as part of a revert/edit war, as u can see in the history of the article. seems ridiculous to be there, but before removing it, consider which name u will write first: the uncited alleged name they are said to use, or the official name the serbian state uses...?  

It's about as ridiculous as the Rumânesce/Rumâneşte in their own designation. We don't know that's their own designation. We could have the designations by which the Romanians call them (they certainly are relevant), but we don't know what they call themselves. Greier's POV pushing has no place here. [",0

 Hello from a main page regular 

Recent vandal attacks on the main page where an 'interesting' picture has been snuck in via unprotected subparts of the main page have been annoying at the least - Yes it's true. It has been one or two lapses of concentration by admins who forgot to protect something that they placed on the front page templates. Admins are human, they do make mistakes. Everyone has been poked and reminded. I'm not saying that it won't happen again, but everything that should be done has.

However.

What should happen when such a vandal attacks?
Within minutes someone with admin ability spots it, quietly reverts it and covers the cracks that the vandal oozed in via. The vandal is blocked, defeated and deflated, they move on.

What does happen when such a vandal attacks?
Everyone, their dog, cat, hamster and rabbits swamp this talk page with """"OMG!11!! I'M OFFENDED!! ARGH! ARGH! MY EYES WTF!"""" style messages of outrage and indignation. The vandal says """"HAR HAR PWND! I EMS TEH 1337"""", posts several taunting messages about how good they are and revels in the afterglow of their nuclear attack.

Eventually, within minutes someone with admin ability spots it, reverts it and covers the cracks that the vandal oozed in via. The vandal is blocked and moves on with a self-satified smug smile and sticky underpants.

People. If you get all up in arms about it, you're feeding the vandal's ego. Just let it pass. It will be reverted within minutes.

"If you're talking about the standard of joining gangs to overpower the bias of other gangs, I do not agree to that standard.  The standard I follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it.  When a gang subverts that process by purposefully making articles worse as punishment or to serve a personal agenda, I tell them how I feel to their face.  Doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.
I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.

I am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that I have never had to compromise.

 Possible amicus appeals 

I thought this comment might be of interest. It indicates that anyone could file an appeal of the block, provided the blocked party indicates he wants to appeal it and indicates where he wants the appeal to be made. Under the circumstances, I think it might be possible that a thread could be opened, maybe at ANI, requesting the block be lifted, or, if that proves unsuccessful or doesn't appeal to you, requesting some sort of discretionary sanctions on individuals who might seek to prejudicially malign others. Under the circumstances, I think that there might be a reasonable chance of the block being lifted based on the prejudicial misrepresentation to which you were responding. Alternately, I think that there might be a very sound basis for requesting that backhanded libellous misrepresentation in the matter of the """"c""""-word might be made subject to discretionary sanctions on its own. 

The question of whether you want to appeal is obviously your choice. But, whether you choose to or not, I would be interested in knowing what you might think of maybe requesting discretionary sanctions regarding further misrepresentation.

Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center? Most major malls have only one picture of the mall, and NorthPark Center, being not too notable nationwide, has 5. Shrek05 14:31 26 Jun 2006

While NorthPark may not (yet) be notable nationwide, I don't see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall, for this reason:  the mall is the largest in Texas (at 2.35 million square feet) and one of the five largest in the US (according to the International Council of Shopping Centers).  Consequently, the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion.  With the 1.4-acre Center Park in the middle, NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating, playing or relaxing.  At one time, shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher, the mall also held the distinction of being largest air-conditioned building in the entire world.
 

 picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong 

The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird (I'm using ver 1.5.0.4 under Windows XP).  It looks fine in Internet Explorer (v 6.0, same OS).  Looking at the page source, it seems like more of a problem with Thunderbird or the CSS for same, but I'm no web developer.  Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it.   

 Fountains 

It's been probably a year since I last visited, but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights, and another feature I can't describe well, sort of a mini-pond with a bridge. Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly. Incidentally, having looked at the existing pictures (only one of which is at all attractive or unique), I think we'd do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead. (I'd have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures; I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class (they thought I was some sort of corporate spy).

 Major Edit (3/26/2007) - Staff Email 

I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license, since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos.  What I got in return was neither photos, nor permission, but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff.  (A full copy of the email is provided )

Most of the email has been transplanted into the article, with a few exceptions, as some parts did not meet Wikipedia's standards of notability or NPOV.

The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark.  The information does not appear to be notable.

The introduction claims """"NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping mall’s in the United States"""" but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as #7 in the US, based on Gross Leasable Area.  The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data, rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Center's website.

Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the """"hard"""" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called """"black swan events"""") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).

Thank you  """"If a country's position on the matter receives significant coverage in high-quality secondary sourcing (mainstream media and scholarly works), it is worth inclusion"""". It's basically the standard for WP:WEIGHT I've been proposing for a while now (except that I offered to adhere to a more strict """"two reliable sources"""" rule). I note that what Langus points out is also of relevance to establish the importance of such a section being present in the article.
@Irondome: the source you presented is a good one to give an idea of the weight assigned to the international position on the issue, it doesn't mean we should base the entire section on that article or only articles from that source (in fact: we should not, the more articles from reliable sources the better). The problem with attempting to come up with a summary like you propose is that it would be very difficult to come to an agreement. In this case, short mentions of individual (or grouped, as to avoid listing) positions could prove to be less prone to attract never-ending discussions.
This is what I suggest (all in one single section with separated paragraphs):

 International position (title)
 Opening paragraph about the disparity in pro-Argentinian and pro-British positions being voiced (properly sourced and neutral)
 UN resolutions (briefly, mainly: """"The UN does not recognize the islanders as having a right to self-determination hence Britain continually rejects the repeated UN's calls for resolving the issue through dialog with Argentina"""")
 Mention of the US and EU neutral positions (the """"Monroe Doctrine"""" should be moved to another part of the article as to not extend the US position too much) as major international players. The fact that the islands are listed as a British OCT by the EU and the Commonwealth should be mentioned too.
 Mention of the majority of Latin American states backing Argentina (as per article presented by Irondome, the article presented by me and this article accessible here, section 3.1). China should be added here too being another major international player.
 Finally Spain's position should be mentioned and also its similar issue with Gibraltar (although editors have previously opposed any mention of Gibraltar here, I still think it is worth of mentioning)

That's my proposal and I am of course open to hear comments and/or corrections. It should end up being quite shorter than the current section and easier to source too. Regards.   """,0

, you said, """"I think LAEC has a valid point that there is an undisclosed COI from those editors, but it's not like that doesn't happen anywhere else.""""  I agree.  What makes this case different, however, and therefore newsworthy, is that person involved is a major player in a major organization, and that organization is a national leader in opposing the very things that its own high ranking member does when she acts anonymously.  For example, the ALA opposed outing a 9/11 terrorist to the police, when that person's own deputy outed a major sports figure on Wikipedia for marital infidelity.  For example, the ALA promotes """"intellectual freedom"""" while anonymously propgandizing on Wikipedia to promote its own political interests.

 Pope Francis article: quote from Jerusalem Post editorial 

Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an """"article"""") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing """"editorials"""" and """"news articles"""" as different types of """"articles"""".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.  In the meantime, I have asked for the opinion of other editors.  Hope we can all agree! Best wishes, and thanks for all your good work on this article.   """,0

Kvens are indigenous to today's Northern Norway

Thank you kindly, user  ! 

The user  may not understand that the Kvens are indigenous to Northern Norway, in my view anyway, and many of the best experts seem to agree.  We are not moved by the personal assumptions and/or believes of the user , but science instead, of course, as you seem to agree. 

The user   Please read the related writings from this column's archive.  The Norse are not indigenous to the extreme Northern Norway of today.  The Kvens are.  The Northern Norway's Tromsa area alone has at least 12 prehistoric Kven place names. 

Historians and linguistics experts have been able to come to this conclusion, for instance based on the words and spellings that were used prior to the time - and/or during the time - when the first Norwegian/Norse immigration to Iceland took place.  The relevant sources have been given in this forum, for instance KVENLAND / KAINUUNMAA, 1986, by the Professor Emeritus Kyösti Julku. 

Where are your sources for counter claims, user  ?  Do we only have your personal narrow view point, which even appears to be based on no sources at all.  If there are sources behind your views, what are they in relation to this matter for instance ? 

The related and quoted experts - earlier mentioned in this forum - are not basing their views only on the writings of Ottar, or Alfred the Great, or Tacitus, or any other before mentioned or not mentioned historian, or other scientist, writer or leader alone, of course.  Ask yourself for instance, who might be behind the prehistoric jewelry hidings that have been discovered only recently from Inari, not that far from the coastline of the Arctic Ocean. 

Examine and read more.  Only after having done that, make your own conclusions, not before, please.  In the meanwhile, let the experts make their conclusions, based on all the material and sources they have available.  Wikipedia is here to reveal the findings of science, not the opinions of yours. 

  It is generally accepted that the Sami people are the indiegenous poeple of Northern Norway. I am aware of the history of this article. If you read the article you will notice footnotes such as this: A reference. These are the references for the paragraph you are reeading. When you click on one you will get the reference list. A link is provided for most articles. I suggest you read the article being referenced, and either start discussing my interepretation of the refered article, or the content of the refered article. For the later you need to provide your own references.  

User Labongo:

Your view is not a """"generally accepted"""" view at all, but only your view.

We hope you agree, that it is not reasonable to request for us to have to provide evidence to everyone separately.  Please check the archive for the beginners. 

There is a reason why we are asking for the exact quotes and exact - easily verifiable (as Mr. Mikkalai put it) - book and page information from you.  The reason is, that simply showing a list of authors and books proves nothing.  Wikipedia's vandals and foul players are known to resort to exactly this sort of tactics.  

Once again:  The sources offered do not agree with the text written in the Kven article !  To understand this, you only have to read the last comments by the user Drieakko''.  As everyone can see, he continues backing up from his statements.  In different ways, he goes on appologizing, while he attempts to round of his false statements.  What does that prove:  This is only a learning processs to him.  He really doesn't have anything to contribute to this topic, except for chaos ! 

User Labongo/Drieakko:  It is your job to show where exactly someone - a respected and known historian or other scientist - agrees with your text.  The burden of proof is in your hands to show evidence.  Please, include exact quote(s) and page information.  That is how Mr. Mikkalai wanted to proceed, after a recent concensus was reached. 

We are quite familiar with the related material in question.  We have provided our sources in detail, you have not, not even a single quote with a matching book and page information.  - - Steve Wondering

[quote]Sociologist and anthropologist Robert Stuckert examined census and fertility data to estimate how many blacks in America had passed as white, and how many whites had African ancestry as a result. His statistical tables showed that during the 1940s, 15,550 light-skinned blacks per year crossed over to live as whites, for a total of about 155,500 for the decade. Based on these figures, he determined that by 1950, some 21% of whites (about 28 million people then) had black ancestry within the last four generations, and he predicted that this number would only grow in the decades to come.[/quote]

 Not so!  Taft made an even bigger error. 

As was thoroughly discussed in the blawgosphere in the last 24 hours or so, there is likely no person anywhere with standing to challenge the oath as void, and in any case taking the oath is a condition precedent to executing the office; it is not actually important that it be done a particular way.

"English English vs American English vs ...

In an earlier edit changing petrol to gas, I wrote in the edit comment that I was changing the wording to American English (gas) because that's the standard for this Wikipedia. Another user pointed out that my assertion of an American English standard for this Wikipedia was incorrect according to the Wikipedia Manual of Style. That user is correct. I was unaware of the Manual of Style's position on this, so I read into it. According to the MoS, there is no standard form of English for the English language Wikipedia. Instead, the language that one uses in a given article depends on: 1) the form of English most closely associated with the topic, and 2) the form of English used by the first major contributor to the article. The article should, in any case, adhere to one standard form of English (for example, American English, British English, Canadian English, Indian English, or Australian English)

I'd like to talk about this for a bit, because I think we may have an interesting boundary case in this article that helps further define the MoS policy on how to select the correct English variant for an article.

English language variants and Unimogs
Item 1 above says that the version of English used in an article should be the one most closely aligned with the subject. The Unimog is a German truck, and so one would have a hard time saying that there is a particular form of English closely aligned with the topic, at least when it's spoken of in Germany. The Unimog has an especially weak association with England, as the British military and farm trades did not (as far as I know) make much use of the Unimog, instead heavily prefering the British designed and built Land Rovers. The Unimog was used in many other nations, however, including Switzerland (by the Swiss military) and some nations in Africa and Asia. I am not aware of the modern history of the Unimog outside of Europe, but I know that in the 60s and 70s, when it was at its peak in terms of exposts, it was purchased in these regions for military applications. In Asia and Africa, I am unaware of any particularly strong association between the Unimog and a given variant of English.

There was one market the Unimog was sold in where there was a strong association with a particular variant of English, and that was the United States. Daimler-Benz, through its dealers and representatives, has sold and services Unimogs in the United States for I believe over twenty years. 

To add to American English argument, in recent years, Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler. Chrysler is a US company.

Further, the US company Applied Minds as widely publicized a variant of the Unimog called the Maximog. This Unimog has received press coverage (a Google search turns up articles on this project in the US newsmedia).

I believe that the Unimog sold more units and has a higher profile in the United States than in any other nation where English is the official language, though perhaps Canada could make a claim. I would like to hear whether others feel that the Unimog has a particularly strong association with Britain, Canada, India, Australia, or another country whose version of English is widely recognized?

English language provenance of the article
Item 2 above refers to the version of English used by the first major contribution to the article (excluding stubs).

I wrote the first version of this article in Sept 2002, and I think I could argue that this was a non-stub creation in American English. The article remained unexpanded until 2004, when other editors added content to it. These edits largely retained the American spelling, but (wisely) introduced metric measurements, which I believe are most strongly associated with Unimogs  I would be surprised if a German-engineered vehicle was built in terms of feet and pounds!

""":: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

"""I understand that a long thread like this can make you confused but, as mentioned before, the traditions were mentioned in passing as a reference to common Swedish culture today (one of the ethnicity criteria). The fact that they perhaps build on earlier pagan traditions, very likely common within the whole Germanic area, is merely interesting.

As for my source, I would still say that self identification based on research is much more legitimate than anything you can come up with. Quoting one sentence from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Webbpage, based on some junior civil servants (webb-editors?) personal opinion, is not more legitimate than creative interpretation of a Swedish medical study (which actually does'nt support your claim).  

Selective quoting out of context in fact seems to be your speciality, regardless of the source. Besides the portion of text you quote regarding a small area of Swedish Finland, you did notice the bold text that forms the summary of the text? """"Det svenska området omfattar Nyland, Åboland, Åland och Österbotten. Området är i stora drag oförändrat sedan 1100- och 1200-talet, då högmedeltidens stora bebyggelsevåg förde svenska nybyggare till de obebodda kusttrakterna i Finland"""" (The Swedish area incompasses Nyland, Åboland, Åland och Österbotten. The area is generally unchanged since the great middle-age migration that carried Swedish settlers to the uninhabited coastal areas of Finland).

As for the paragraph on movemement that you quote a part of, it concludes with: """"Flyttning över den (språkgränsen) har förekommit i alla tider, men har blivit en företeelse i stor skala först i vår tid"""" (Movement over the language-border has taken place in all times, but has become a large scale phonomenon only in our time).

Your comparison to Ireland is interesting and in your mind perhaps even relevant. The Irish situation is however different, e.g. the English occupation actively surpressed the Irish language, culture and heritage. Something similar did not take place in Finland. In fact the Finnish language was actively developed and promoted by Finland Swedes (initially due to academic interest and in the 19th century as a bulwark against Russification).

"Gibnews: I agree with you that the geographical argument is a weak one in general. I understand that you are an activist on the issue of gibraltar and i ill try not to offend you. Your reference to Canarias is understandable. However, Morocco cannot validly claim the canaries because there are 2 million canarians who are neither arabs nor muslims and who are spaniards wishing to remain part of the EU and of a democratic state. Morocco has no relation whatsoever with the canaries at any level neither culturally nor historically. If there was such a relation and morroco was a functioning democracy i would be the first to support a morrocan claim on the islands. I understand, for example and contrary to most spaniards, morocco's claim on western sahara. Firstly, the saharaouis are very few and their independence would clearly have been the result of european colonialism of the maghreb and algerian expansionism in the region. I understand how countries which have been subjected to the humiliation of colonialism feel, their borders being decided by foreign powers, and i believe that the polisario should take their people out of the horrendous conditions they live in in the camps of Tindouf and move back to their land.

Warning, stop vandalism and say why you are so stupid nationalist?""""

Sorry if you don't get the reply right away. The problem is I am not sure I understand your request. Since it is so, I will take the liberty and divide it into three parts:
warning
request to stop (vandalism)
request to answer a question

Answer is this:
 .... Warning? As in threat?
 .... You want me to stop? Is it vandalism that you want me to stop? If to both questions the answer is yes, then my reply is a question: why do you write that vandalism is what I do?
 .... This is the toughest to comprehend. You ask why, and actually I am not sure. You write the syntagma stupid nationalist. If you think that I am a stupid nationalist, maybe you could think over. At least for the """"stupid part"""" of the syntagma. As for the part that writes nationalist, I only could agree with you with the meaning that I'm trying to defend my habitat. Ofcourse, this what I write is from my POV.
 All the best,

 Disparity between Traditional Jewish Dates and Academic Dates 

User:PiCo, I will desist from making edits in this current article, since I feel my input might be misconstrued or disruptive, and that, of course, would not be my intent. However, please be apprised that there is a vast disparity between the traditional Jewish method of calibrating years based on a carefully guarded oral tradition, as opposed to modern methods used primarily by Christians who rely heavily upon the modern academic methods applied in dating chronology. The two are still reconcilable, but it will take a vast amount of effort and a person of """"long wind"""" (patience) and extreme diligence to even begin to explain where the discrepancies have """"crept-in"""" to ancient chronologies. The Jews insist that there were only 210 years of slavery in Egypt, although the 430 years mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are merely counted from the time of Isaac's birth, until the departure of Israel from Egypt. You see, """"strangers in a land not theirs,"""" really begins with Abraham's seed in the land of Canaan. Anyway, my view is not to interrupt your work, but to let it proceed on course. I would, however, have preferred to see you mention more about the """"other method"""" practiced by mainstream Judaism, whether it is accepted or not by Christian or academic circles. This would have given more balance to the current article. I have an inkling that someone will eventually start another article dealing only the Jewish tradition of biblical chronology.

If I might say, for us, the Scroll of Antiochus is considered a reliable source.

 CERTAIN FLAWS WITH MODERN SCHOLARSHIP:
 
I wish to point out something about modern scholarship that I think we should be aware of. Research has been carried out in France by a certain Christian Robin and André Lemaire on the subject of the 
Queen of Sheba and King Solomon.
 
André Lemaire wrote: “The hypothesis of a Sheba in Northern Arabia at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE (Noth 1968: 223-224; Würthwein 1977: 121; Eph‘al 21984: 88-89, 227-229; Garbini 1984; Sarkiö 1994:190; Mulder 1998: 509-510) has no basis and is generally abandoned (Robin 1992: col. 1109-1110, 1118; Avanzini 1996: 13; Kitchen 1997b: 128.”
 
He also writes: “The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339-357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279-282; Holladay 2006: 319-321).”
 
Contrary to modern scholarship, it should be noted here that, in Jewish tradition, king Solomon did not begin his reign in circa 1,000 BCE, as purported by modern scholarship, but rather in circa 843 BCE, as we find in Jewish tradition. Likewise, in Jewish tradition, the first Temple was destroyed in 422 BCE, rather than in the erroneous date used by scholars of the western world to fix its destruction, i.e. in 586 BCE. Modern scholars totally ignore Jewish tradition and wrongly put historical events at least 200 years earlier, which accounts for the discrepancies in calibrating these important events and not finding historical records to substantiate these events.
 
The one major flaw in their critical view of Jewish texts is the belief that if they cannot find an archaeological document affirming a certain event mentioned in the Bible, for them it is as though the event never happened. This is a fallacy in logic.

To begin to tackle this tremendous difficulty with modern scholarship and Jewish tradition, we must first lay down a premise that will follow us all throughout this discussion, and that is the fact that historical records have been kept by Jews since ancient times, and they have often preserved these very written accounts of events by marking their dates in the Seleucid Era counting. This is vital, as without which information, it will be virtually impossible to determine the sequence of events and to correctly compare them with dates in the Julian / Gregorian calendars. 

The Aramaic """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" known in Hebrew as """"Megillath Benei Hašmonai"""" (The Scroll of the Sons of Asamoneus), is a curious document, alleged by Rabbi Saadia Gaon in his Introduction to """"Ha-Eggron"""" to have been written by the elders of the schools of Hillel and Shammai in the Chaldaic language, meaning, a document that dates back earlier than the book Seder Olam, composed by Rabbi Yose b. Halpetha in the 2nd century CE. In that book, the """"Scroll of Antiochus,"""" we find this remarkable remark, viz., that """"from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total.""""

Well thank you for at least stepping up and citing some kind of reasoning for what I consider unreasonable actions on the part of others Bob Rayner!

No original research?  Are you kidding me?  Years of research was reported (both failures and successes), that was also physically verified experimentally by over 20 others world-wide, and is cited on my original, and now archived (and now unalterable by me) open.org/davidc website, on both archive.go-here.com and archive.org in Europe.

The past updates on that archive collection details those years of experimental research, including the works of others on the subject around the world, beginning with the first physical verifications by James Hurl of Australia, and follows the story through to the last update before I gave up for a while out of exasperation, due to unrelenting stupidity and prejudice (don't confuse our religiously scientific dogma by citing facts).

The theory of operation I believe is clearly stated, and the """"flat earth"""" prejudice against the subject is apparent in the overall tone and presentation of the balance of the definition of """"Inertial_Propulsion"""".  A lone dissenting voice challenging the current dogma is how ALL of science progresses past the ignorance of yesteryears.

To disallow original research is to attempt to hold ALL of science to a stable state, and ignores the dynamic nature of the search for greater truths than we currently understand.

Science is NOT a BIBLE, and DOGMA is anathema to the entire process of research!

 GAC review 

This article is off to a good start, but I see some problems with the sourcing, formatting and prose that concerns me.  At this moment the article does not fulfill the GA criteria, but I'm willing to put the nomination on hold in order to allow contributors to work.  Here are some suggestions/comments for improvement:

The references are a mess.  None of them are formatted properly and several of them (IMDb, scifipedia, hunkymalecelebs) are not from reliable sources.  I suggest using citation templates in order to correctly format the links and look for replacement refs for those from disreputable sources.  (habla conmigo) 
Two fansites are linked to in the external links.  Per WP:EL, there should be none.  Also remove the duplicate IMDb link to the awards and nominations page; this is redundant.
:Image:Han2.jpg does not have a fair use rationale.
The use of """"influential"""" in the lead, although sourced, is open to debate.  I would remove it entirely.
More information needs to be given in order for the lead to adhere to WP:LEAD; there is no mention of his early life, music training, family, or cult following.  Nil by Mouth shouldn't be mentioned by itself and more can be said about his film making, as well.
and can be seen singing and playing piano in the 1988 movie Track 29, and tracing over pre-recorded versions of Beethoven's music in Immortal Beloved: Ref?  Also remember to italicize the film name.
The """"Music"""" section is only one sentence long and no date is given.  The biography should follow a chronological timeline.
After graduating from drama school in 1979, Oldman spent almost eight years in theater, winning various awards: such as...?  Ref?
successfully using an American accent: what does """"successfully"""" refer to?  The accent itself?
In October 2007, movie website TheShiznit.co.uk... how is this a notable website/accolade?
Because of its length, I suggest breaking the """"Filmography"""" list into two columns.
Oldman also directed the music video for """"Red Rover"""", a song from Jewish Rap Group Chutzpah's 2nd CD """"Hip Hop Fantasy,"""": the first comma placement (outside of the quotation marks) is correct, the second isn't; there are several of these that need to be fixed throughout the article.
I did not read the prose too closely, but once these issues have been taken care of, I'm willing to give it a second review.  Until then, I'm going to put the nomination on hold.  Please do let me know if you have any questions or comments.  (habla conmigo) """,0

I've removed the merger and notability tags from this article, as it placed in the top 10 (not 24th, as you've suggested to the anon who queried it) in the largest competitive music festival in the world.

My gut feeling is that there is little substantive difference between Template:R from subtopic and Template:R to section.  What is unfortunate is the merger of concepts underlying Template:R from subtopic and Template:R with possibilities as it is a truism that almost all tolerated titles and named concepts have the possibility of becoming an article though there might be a very small probability of this taking place.

"""

I don't buy those arguments.

First, there has also been a recent trend of creating a season article for every Division I program for each of the last 3 or so seasons. I see no reason that that trend won't start to backtrack into earlier teams. Pages getting deleted have less to do with the notion of a single-season article being inherently non-notable, than it has to do with those specific articles not being up to standards. Just look at all the single-season Nebraska football articles that are being created and kept. You say, """"There will never be a separate article for any of these pre-2000 Gators football teams."""" That's a rather bold proclamation to issue on behalf of all editors, present and future. Never say never.

I don't buy that you need to bypass the redirect to take the reader to the applicable section. That's why the season redirects typically redirect to the correct section in the target article. Even better, in case the sections get renamed, only the redirect will need to have its link tweaked, rather than the set of all articles that bypassed the redirect.

Just because there is only one single season article between 1906 and 1999 right now, it does not preclude the distinct possibility of there being more. Especially when many of those 1990's squads finished in the top 10, and the 1995 team actually played in the national championship game - how is that not notable?

Merging the decade articles is a fine consensus. I'm in no way countering that. However, consensus can change over time, and there is no need to prevent other articles from linking to new Florida season articles should that situation ever arise.

I don't know why you bring in broken links, unless you're suggesting that the decade articles would be deleted, and that somehow the bot could figure out to point the link at the season article at that point. Why not keep it simple, and leave the link to the redirect. That way, there is no need for this magic bot. That's one of the main features of redirects: to serve as a placeholder for a possible future article distinct from the redirect target. You call my arguments specious, yet I'm not the one trying to justify departure from accepted Wikipedia guidelines.

True, the answer is obvious. Have the redirect point at the correct section of the decade article. Simple as that. I'll even help update the redirect targets. FaultRyan """,0

 Civility 
Regarding edits such as this: Please do not make personal attacks on other people. Wikipedia has a policy against personal attacks. In some cases, users who engage in personal attacks may be blocked from editing by admins or banned by the arbitration committee. Comment on content, not on other contributors or people. Please resolve disputes appropriately. Thank you.   
You shouldn't just be thinking about that, but also WP:CIVIL. Every comment you made towords this user was sarcastic, belittling, or otherwise uncivil, and therefore unacceptable.  
accusing him of """"acting childish"""", mocking his grammer, and saying things like """"nice contradiction"""" are all uncivil comments, regardless of how he acted.  
You're attacking him as a person as well as being abusive in response to him; I think the tag is appropriate.  
See the links I provided two comments up. You've been completely disrespectful to this user through all of your interactions with him.

 Good point! Which is why I long ago (it seems, i.e. earlier yesterday, as soon as I learned how) bowed to the formality of acquiring the Wikipedia-form permission. - Still, it'll be awhile, I hope, before sueing someone for using a Nobel-laureate's four-line obituary of Hitler will be publicity to """"revel"""" in. Even Murdoch (jewish, sadly relevant in this case) might not want to appear """"supporting"""" Hitler that way. Or maybe not, who knows, he might want that obituary suppressed from ever being quoted again. Better safe than sorry, I agree. I like following the guide-lines, but it was hard getting easy info on them, and unpleasant getting there. I bite back, sure - but only """"back"""". On the issue itself, I cherish being as correct as only possible. Yet in the relevant case, copy for """"educational purposes"""" would be validly claimed - until tried and determined otherwise. Better safe than sorry. Though there's always a limit to how little """"risk"""" should, and can, be taken. No risk is never an option.""",0
"I will suggest you to be more careful not to be the source of a new chaos instead of defusing one....it will be most distressing to witness such one again.

You took some mesures who are unlikely to be the right ones in that case, and it will crave a certain degree of familiarity with the subject and its history to can handle the task properly.
Do not dismiss users with longer experience with the case as it was based on this experience that the talk page was brought out. For instance, I received mails from the person who wrote the biography of the affair both for the french and the english talk page, as those din't knew enough about the matter to start with.
If I were you, I will feel suspicious of receiving approuval and encouragemets about what you are doing, from a person who first heard about this affair for 3 weeks ago, second: heard about it from ybm -the drive force of this affair and person who resurected it from ashes in nov. 2003 - so not much reliable as an eye opener and arbitrary source of informations, and third: who has conducted, since then, a revert war in the best anti-3RR rules, and best ybm styles...

It isn't right for an admi to emit subjectiv and judgementals accusations toward users, as calling them socket puppet and other insulting terminology, as it is usually to be found in the mouth of the persons who in shortage of argumentation, choose to attack people personnaly in best sophistics style.
So no surprise that the person who rever you is the same one who used that language constantly against other users before you stepped in, and who was also doing the reverting job as you are doing it now.

It is abusively unclear, what you are trying to do, and I do hope that a more adequate person will take over the surveillance of this talk page. One with the right degree of integrity, the proper knowledge of the stuff, here physic, a thourough insight in the affair and its history, and a knowledge of the people involved and their characters and profile in regard to the topic.
I think here of Nicholas Turnbull, administrator, and expert in mediation.

I have, unfortunately, to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site, based both on your actions and your utterings, and that you have provocated 50% of the users, who had already been harshly provocated by user r-b-j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it, not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils.

I do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts, but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don't bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process, and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page.

As those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time, without everreaching a solid ground of agreement, and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago, where most did redraw it, and as all those people of science didn't knew a thing about Theoretical Physic and/or Cosmologie, which this dispute is about, and as the positiv statements, made by specialists in the fields named above, are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons, as are the statements made on this page by pro-bogdanovian, who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no, I suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field, I named Holger Beck Nielsen professor of the Copenhague Niels Bohr Institut of Theoretical Physic, and Stephen W. Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.

I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.
I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.
I will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment, in the best interest of all parts involved.

All have been actively revert-warring on psychotronics, with the apparent """"front"""" that they have no idea what the true meaning of psychotronics is.  They have created an article which purported that the use of psychotronics was limited to a very short (5 year) period in the 60's and that interest in it had died down completely since the death of the original inventor.

Quite to the contrary, all members of this group are also all long time reverters on:

Thought_insertion
Mind_control
Directed_energy_weapons
Telepathy

This shows not only that they know exactly what """"psychotronics"""" means, but that they are actively attempting to censor anything related to the Russian programs continued existence, through the use of WP:FRINGE as a shield.  This is completely inappropriate in the face of sources that come directly from United States Military, Governmental and Russian MIlitary and Governmental official statements and publications.  Yet they persist to revert this information nearly across the board.  There is a significant problem here.

Though their acting in unison has not been presented until they had to fight against actual sources on the Psychotronics page.  Still, they clearly are *aware* of what they are doing.  This is more than gaming, this is intentional, and obvious.

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at User:The Transhumanist/Outline of knowledge.

"Improvements
I have completed the B class checklist and believe that this article is a Start class article as it fails to meet B class criteria 1 and 2. I believe that the article could be improved by addressing the following issues:

 Referencing: the addition of inline citations would help improve the verifiability of the information in the article. For a successful B class review the article requires at least one in line citation per paragraph or block of information (more if multiple sources were used);
 Coverage: there are large sections in complete which need to be finished before it can be assessed properly. Additionally, the article does not seem to indicate when the Division was disbanded, or what its fate was after WWI. Was it disbanded, if so was it ever re-raised?

Just a few ideas. If you would like more comprehensive comments regarding the article you might like to submit it for peer review by going to WP:MHPR, but I suggest waiting until the article has been completed before doing this. Also once you feel it requires re-assessment, please add it to the list at WP:MHA. Hope this helps.",0

It has a big natural resource in fish due to be a continental shelf larger than Greenland size. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for
eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass
was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains
incomplete.http://www.ccamlr.org/ccamlr_science/Vol-16-2009/01Duhamel-Hautecoeur.pdf

The continental shelf teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' abyssal plain. The pelagic (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone, and the benthic (sea floor) province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone.Pinet 316-17, 418-19.
Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and hydrocarbon extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the Convention on the Continental Shelf drawn up by the UN's International Law Commission in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

France extend its jurisdiction over 567 732 square kilometers of the neighboring continental shelf from the land area of 7 215 resulting in 574 947 square kilometers. There are besides some fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island, a department of France approximately 3,300 km (2,100 miles) to the north, who are licensed to fish within the archipelago's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Govern of France principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus mostly on scientific research, earth sciences and biology. 
The so-called Kerguelen microcontinent or Kerguelen Plateau include charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level an covered by dense conifer forest.  Tt sanks 20 million years ago and is now  below sea level. It has sedimentary rocks similar to the ones found in Australia and India, suggesting it was gondwanan origen.

The former sounding rocket range to the east of Port-aux-Français  is currently the site of a SuperDARN radar.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station which is located four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. There was a need for a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, foreign place like Australia or New Zealand.""""

"Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.

The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.",0

However, WGKF believes that the story of GKIF is wrong and is only told in that way so they can promote themselves better. The true history NEEDS to be told in the article about WGKF. It's their viewpoint and therefore important information for an understanding of the way WGKF thinks, trains and deals with the situation. The story on the GKIF page is their viewpoint, and I think they will find it important to tell this story for their own reasons... 
I will see how this story can be rewritten, but it cannot be discarded totally from WGKF.   """,0

Hi Yamla. Last week you blocked me for 72 hours for inappropriate edits of mine, which I'll accept were perhaps a little extreme.

I don't understand post signing but I think note 117 ending the section on Justice Verma Commission is very misleading. The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the women's groups in India maintain. The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it. The rushed through new anti-rape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma. Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test (it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure) and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal. I accept the Cabinet are making positive noises about it though they are unlikely to accept any of Justice Verma's proposals or adopt the spirit of his reforms ie demanding equal respect for women from low castes tribals and minority indian communities. i am adding four tildas now but I presume that's wrong desmond coutinho,0

Ermie Smith writes
Æµ§œš¹  You asked me to cite other inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article on Ebonics.  I direct your attention to the Wikipedia article on the “Oakland Ebonics Controversy”.  The Wikipedia article states:  “For students whose primary dialect was AAVE, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in that dialect, both for """"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills."""" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both AAVE and Standard English to the level of those teaching LEP (limited English proficiency) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAVE themselves.[1]”      This not accurate.  In fact it is an outright lie.   In the first place, the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".   As proof of this assertion I cite the fact it that the appellations African American Vernacular English does not appear anywhere in the entire OUSD resolution.  In fact the first four Whereas clauses of the OUSD resolution speak only to the existence of a linguistic continuity of the West Niger-Congo African language system in the language of African slave descendants and their unique language stature.   The very first whereas clause of the OUSD resolution states: WHEREAS, numerous validated studies demonstrate that African-American students as part of their culture and history as African people possess and utilize a language described in various scholarly approaches as “Ebonics” (literally Black sounds) or “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” or “African Language Systems.”  [For more information relative to the appellation “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” see Pan African Language In The Western Hemisphere (1973)]  The second Whereas clause of the resolution states: “Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that African language systems have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages  and are not merely dialects of English”.   Now what more evidence does it take to prove that the OUSD resolution was not about African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution?
Here is more.  A critical analysis will reveal that in its very essence the OUSD resolution was about the vindication of the equal protection of the law rights of the Afrocentric parents and their children under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  That is, the right of English Language Learners (ELL) of African ancestry to not be discriminated against on the basis of their language ancestry and provided instruction in the English language as a second language, i.e.,ESL.  In short, to be provided a Free and Appropriate Public Education.   As proof of this assertion I cite the fifth whereas clause of the OUSD Board's resolution which reads: """"Whereas, judicial cases in states other than California have recognized the unique language stature of African American pupils, and such recognition by courts has resulted in court-mandated educational programs which have substantially benefited African American children in the interest of vindicating their equal protection of the law rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the  United States Constitution.""""  (See OUSD resolution page 1. para. 5.)  As further evidence that the OUSD Board's resolution was about """"Ebonics"""", """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" or """"African Language Systems"""" and not African American Vernacular English, I cite the fact that first ‘Now Therefore Be It Resolved’ clause of the OUSD resolution states: “NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Education officially recognizes the existence of, and cultural and linguistic bases of West and Niger -Congo African Languages Systems and these are the language patterns that many African American students bring to school;”  Clearly based on this passage of the resolution what the OUSD Board was addressing was the existence of  """"Ebonics"""", """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" or """"African Language Systems"""" and not African American Vernacular English.   The second “Therefore be it resolved” clause of the OUSD resolution states:  “BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Educ",0

Iranian V Persian
I see you asked about this on the Wiki Project Iran talkpage. Iranian, originally meant the Iranian peoples, which are a number of ethnic groups including the Persian people. The Iranian sate was named after the Iranian people and many dynasty's that ruled Iran historicly were not ethnically Persinal at all. Despite being known as Iran internally, for it's entire history, the Greeks refered to the country as Persia, in reference to the country's most important ethnic group at the time and this name was later adopted by the Roman's and then used throughotu the West until 1936 when Reza Shah got the Western states to officially recognise the country's name as Iran. Now although, in today's world """"Iranian"""" most commonly refers to citizen of Iran and """"Persian"""" to the ethnic group Persian people (not all of which are from Iran, since there are milions of ethnic Presians in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), with the term """"Iranic"""" being commonly used to refer to the """"Iranian Peoples"""" in the sense of all these different ethnic groups (Persians, Pashtuns, Kurds, Baluchis, ect.), however, due to wikipedia policies of English being Wikipedia's language here, Iran historicly is being refered to as the """"Persian Empire"""" or """"Persia"""" (which is infact a region in Iran), it's citizens as """"Persians"""" (although many of the notable Iranian citizens of the past weren't ethnic Persians and infact none of the kings of the """"Persian"""" empire from 1501 (re-establishment of Iranian state) until 1979 (abolishment of monarchy) were ethnic Persians) and so on wikipedia Iranian individuals prior to 1936 are refered to as Persians and Iran is refered to as Persia in articles concerning pre-1936 history.

Edicts from above are a growing concern for those who believe Wikipedia should be what it purports itself to be in newspapers, magazines, and to new members: a community of editors. As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?

In such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher. People would sign for either support or no-confidence along with examples of the editor in question creating an edict without consensus, or a statement of why they believe the alleged edicts are in line with community consensus. Please feel free to start or add to Wikipedia:No confidence and to duplicate this message or tell other editors who want to see Wikipedia succeed. KIMP (spewage)",0

"I submitted this information from the Carina Software Voyager program. Because everyone online seems to think Sothis rises the same day every year at every latitude. The date July 20 is Julian and comes from 30 degree GIza and Memphis. At 31 degree Alexandria (and Ur) the absence is 72 days instead of 70 because it cannot be seen July 20 and it rises a day later on July 21. Septua-Gint means 72 not 70. That's the first fact the rise is pending latitude. The further fact is that rise at Memphis is July 17 not July 20 thru the years 2782-1872bc which means in 2782bc the July 20 rise of Sothis on Thoth 1 is already the 4th rising having been seen July 17 on epagum day 3.

"""If Canada abolished the monarchy or changed the succession rules it would have no impact on the UK. Conversely, if the UK were to change its succession rules and Canada maintained the status quo, we would be faced with the possibility of having to completely change our system to accomodate a resident monarchy - when our political system and constitution are not designed for an absentee monarch (hence the position of governor general which does not exist in the UK). TAB 

The """"British monarchy"""" is """"first among equals"""" in political terms as the abolition of the monarchy in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc would have no impact on the monarchy in Britain whereas the abolition of the monarchy in the UK would almost certainly lead to its extinction in the rest of the Commonwealth Realms.

The fact is that the system in the """"Commonwealth Realms"""" (outside of the UK) was designed with the assumption that the monarch would be resident in London. Do you deny that?TAB

The fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in Britain. She has spent 2% of her reign in Canada and, I suspect, around that percentage or less in the other Commonwealth Realms.TAB

The fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a) her British subjects and the British political system and b) her subjects and the political systems in the other Commonwealth realms.

The most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the Governor General in the Commonwealth Realms is played by the Queen herself in Britain. i.e. The Queen, with increasingly rare exceptions, does not give royal assent to bills passed in Commonwealth legislatures or even give the Throne Speech (what in Britain is called the Queen's Speech because the Queen herself gives it). She does not name the Prime Ministers in Commonwealth Realms, does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in Commonwealth Realms and does not have weekly meetings with her Commonwealth PMs.TAB

Now monarchists like to believe that the Queen is fully informed and intimately involved in, let's say, Canadian affairs. The reality is that in the Commonwealth Realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity, much more so than in Britain.TAB

Let me give you a hard example. We now know that the Queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of Gough Whitlam in Australia in 1975. This was done by Governor General Kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happened.TAB

Let me give you another example. We now know thanks to the 30 year disclosure rule that the Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in Britain complaining of this or that government policy (this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being """"above politics""""). We also know from biographies and autobiographies that UK Prime Ministers do give some consideration to what the Queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister. It may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture. That is simply not the case for Commonwealth Realm PMs. There is no evidence of royals writing Canadian or Austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of Canadian or Australian PMs being particularly concerned about what the Queen might think, at least not to the extent as is the case in the UK. TAB

Now you might say but the Governor General acts on HMs behalf so there's really no difference. But there is, the Queen's role in the UK is unmediated, in the realms it is mediated by a GG and she is almost a complete absentee from the process.TAB

Therefore, it's quite clear that her role is much more important in the UK than elsewhere. 

Also, the fact that the systems in the Commonwealth Realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a GG in place Britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where Commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the Queen's role in the UK. 

The fact is if Britain became a republic the Commonwealth Realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the Windsors, or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where, say, she spends one month in each realm.TAB

The fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family's wishes, including the possibility that they would not want to move to Canada or Australia but would prefer to either remain in a British republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in Europe (or even the US). That would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new mon",0

I think most of the """"ZipLocal, inc"""" article is incorporated in the """"User:Misterkellas/ZipLocal"""" article.

But that was seven years before Tamec was renamed Zip411 then bought by redCity, then that company was renamed Ziplocal, then that company was bought out, then that company was bought out and in the meantime a completely new company renamed itself Ziplocal then traded stock in exchange for the US parts of the yellow page search information.

 November 2015 

 Hello, Callmemirela! It is nice to meet you. Your help in improving the page for Criminal Minds (season 11), specifically the episode section, is much appreciated!I'm glad you kept me on my toes about putting the episode summary in my own words, so as not to violate any copyright laws; for that I'm quite grateful to you. Criminal Minds is, by far, my favorite show and I love to help keep fellow fans informed.

However, in my entire time editing Criminal Minds pages - which has been a little while; while I am fairly new to Wikipedia, this account was created with the (2) at the end because my previous account of the same name was inaccessible because I forgot my password lol - I have not once, by any editor, been asked/required to provide refernces for the production codes. Title, writer, director, and air date absolutely require references! But the production code is usually confirmed in one of the references whether it be title, writer, director, air date or any combination therein, added to the fact that the air dates can help determine the order in which the episodes will air, they are almost always confirmed.

Although, I have come to understand there can be an exception in which the production codes can serve quite useful! This is when episodes air out of order, an example of which would be in Season 10, 1006, """"Boxed In"""", was aired before 1005, """"If the Shoe Fits"""", because """"Boxed In"""" was the Halloween episode and it was scheduled to air on 11/05 whereas """"If the Shoe Fits"""" was scheduled to air on 10/29; to resolve this, they merely switched their air dates, however, the production codes remained the same, therefore letting people know that they were aired out of order to accommodate Halloween. In that case, I believe it was briefly required to include references with the production codes. That, however, was the only time I've ever been required to provide a reference for a production code.

I've posted references for all of the upcoming production codes to satisfy your need for me to do so and prove to you that I would not post those codes without knowing that their validity can eventually be found through other references. In conclusion, I absolutely agree with you that I needed to avoid violating copyright by denoting the summaries in a vernacular (lexicon; vocabulary; my own words) more unique to me, basically, to make them be more so in my own words, but I don't agree that the production codes need referencing. You are the first person who has ever asked me to do so. I do want you to know, though, that I always use reliable references for my episode title, writer, director and/or air date contributions, and that I take copyright violation (avoiding it!) very seriously!

I really appreciate your willingness to help make the page as accurate as possible; that is my objective as well. I just don't think that it is necessary to reference the production codes, since all episodes have aired in order, thus far, and we (the fans) have been given no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. When it is required due to scheduling changes, I'd be happy to post it. I hope we can resolve this minor misunderstanding. Happy editing!

Amerindianarts, if you are referring to synthetic a priori knowledge such as mathematical principles, you are absolutely correct — today such principles are continually honed and developed, and work side by side with empirical investigation of the natural world.

Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. I disagree that New Englanders moved into New York City and changed the accent to non-rhotic. Lots of people moved into New York City...Jews, Italians, and Irish being the biggest. I think New Englanders might be around # 178 on the list of groups moving to NYC, and the New Engand -ar is so different from the NYC -ar that we can forget the whole theory. Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like Syracuse or Albany did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around Syracuse is the same as that in the city. People move back and forth all the time. You have to have a big city like NYC or Boston to have enough isolation to create a new accent. There is no variation in accent anywhere from eastern NY to Syracuse, city, rural, or whatever, because people move around too much and there is no isolation. The first change going west happens in Rochester, where o changes to a. So, """"doctor"""" becomes """"dactor,"""" """"contact"""" lenses becomes """"cantact"""" lenses.

Confucius predates Aristotle in using family as a model for the state.

The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government.

 Your edit on National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma 

I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me """"foolish"""" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would.

 Cleanup 

The constant edit-warring on this short little article has got to stop, so I'd like to bring up the edits by  in the hope of generating some discussion and reaching a long-overdue consensus.

1. The first sentence says tomoi is the result of """"Siamese influence in the area"""" and provides two references. However, this is not in the given citations. These references deal with the history of the Thai community in Kedah, but make no mention of tomoi or kickboxing. Am I wrong?

2. The word tomoi is usually said to be a cognate of dhoi muay rather than a derivative term. Anyone fluent in both Malay and Thai will be aware of the many cognates such as the words for """"lizard"""", """"door"""", """"key"""", and the numerous Sanskrit-derived terms. Muay or moi comes from the Sanskrit mavya, therefore it would be incorrect to say that one derives from the other. They are similar because they come from the same source and because the two countries are neighbours.

3. I wrote in the article that tomoi in the Malay language refers to the local style of kickboxing while tinju is the generic word for any boxing art, particularly the western kind. I sourced a dictionary for this sentence. Yet the sentence has been edited and now defines tomoi as the """"sport of Siamese Kedah"""", while still retaining the given source. In other words, it's not in the citation given, once again.

4. Why is so much emphasis given to Kedah when the art is most often associated with Kelantan? This is consistent with the sources provided since all of them mention Kelantan. A major reason why the sport is not so well-known today is because it was banned in Kelantan where it was most popular. The state government even planned to rename tomoi """"Kelantan boxing"""". Yes it is practiced in Kedah and other states as well, but to state conclusively that tomoi comes from Kedah is simply not supported by any source or even general public opinion.

5. The first few sentences of the history section are atrociously-written and repeat some of the same material which I had already written in and sourced.

6. Language like """"it is a clear fact"""" seems pointy.

7. The first paragraph of the history section does not deal with tomoi or any martial art. Why does it matter how many temples are in Kedah? What does the dominant religion or language of the state have to do with anything? The same two references are provided for the paragraph once again, and neither are relevant to the article. But the sourced paragraph is followed by the sentence """"The art of """"Tomoi"""" or """"ToiMauy""""(ต่อยมวย) were teach and practice among these Siamese communities in Kedah and Kelantan"""" which is unsourced and entirely POV.

8. The origin of Indochinese kickboxing is a disputed topic. Authors like Draeger mention Chinese and Indian influence on muay Thai, which can logically be extended to tomoi, pradal serey, etc. But then there are those (unreliable) sources which claim bokator as the common ancestor. I thought it fair to say that their origin is unclear. Yet the article states very conclusively that tomoi is of Siamese origin and goes on to mention the regional styles of muay boran. Silat Embo (the precursor of tomoi) and Siku 12 (a related style) are not mentioned.

9. """"It is also a clear fact that the system of Tomoi, be the guard,stance,and striking techniques, is identical to Muay Thai."""" This is actually true. And putting aside any modern political boundaries, tomoi is the same as muay Thai and Muay Lao. I can say this from personal experience. However, that doesn't necessarily mean tomoi came from muay Thai. As mentioned before, they may all have their origins in Cambodia or somewhere else.

10. The history section continues by saying that boxers originally wrapped their hands in hemp ropes, and provides an irelevant source which only deals with muay Thai in Thailand. The editor then goes on to say that these hand-wraps did not exist prior to Ayutthaya. First of all, boxers fought bare-fisted before the custom of wrapping the hands. And more importantly, sources like Draeger say the date at which boxers first began wrapping their hands """"cannot be known with certainty"""". And even if the practice does not predate Ayutthaya, that doesn't mean it comes from Ayutthaya. And even if it does, that doesn't mean tomoi comes from Thailand. That's quite a stretch.   """,0

""""Comment"""""""". Gentlemen, this article provides an insight of the Albanian version of said historical period. Serb or Montenegrin sources are welcome although the sources i've provided have gained a lot of information from Montenegro (specifically regarding the part with King Nicholas of Montenegro) there is nothing irredentist or non-reliable about this. Mr Zoupan has been actively persecuting my posts as he is a fascist, irredentist nationalist himself who constantly removes my edits despite the fact that i provide PROPER sources as it does not fit his nationalistic preferences. I would appreciate if Zoupan would provide some counter-sources for his claim instead of just bashing on Albanian history of which he is not competent nor reliable enough to handle. Thanks for me. For source regarding this period there is plenty. This article is important and provides a different perspective, aside from the very Pro-slav, fascist versions. Thank you.   """,0

"""
When I say """"insecurity"""", I mean as a result of the PRC's continued emphasis on """"liberating Taiwan"""" and coupling the issue with the national psyche to the point where no one in Beijing today could afford to be seen as having """"lost Taiwan"""" (the fact that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC not withstanding). Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II, with Mao even being quoted in the 30's as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan. Why Taiwan and not Mongolia? Well politics basically... the PRC's need to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union at the time and to drum up support against """"western imperialism"""" and CKS's Taipei regime. CKS of course also recognized Mongolia in the 20's or 30's to try to woo Soviet support, but """"revoked it"""" (ha ha) after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the Soviets anymore. Today CKS and Mao are long gone but the shadow of their vendettas still remain. - """,0
", saying “I’m doing this for your own good” does not negate the act of drunkenly abusing one’s children.  Similarly, declaring that you are not canvasing when that is precisely what you are doing does not in any way change the act that was performed.

Had you summoned Collect when no poll was taking place then your act would be less suspicious, but the summoning of allies to influence a polling action is precisely the sort of activity that WP:canvass prohibits.

That wasn't an appeal, of course. But I'm dissappointed Cailil. This reply was the sort of lazy, hackneyed tripe I would expect from the average joe that that hangs out at ANI, or from the sort of petty pointless admin who runs around dolling out the stock phrases like this and blocking socks without even bothering to look at the edits they make, the sort of admin where you can be sure that for 90% of their daily activites, thinking about whether they're even benefitting Wikipedia or not doesn't even enter their thought process. You just thanked Black Kite for the """"heads up"""", which you would never have even got if it wasn't for me, the evil rule breaker. What's up with that? Can you deal with that Cailil? Can you deal with the idea that someone like me can in your eyes be 'breaking a rule' on Wikipedia (which, I might add, you still haven't even proven), while also apparently benefitting it by shining a light on the continuing bad behaviour of HighKing. You can't in all seriousness expect to come here and expect me to listen to this sort of crap, when you've discredited it with your own actions elsewhere. I saw Jimbo talking recently about how he vehemently disagreed with someone's claim that Wikipedia was very bad at dealing with whistleblowers. What say you? Or is it all just rhetoric to you? You could unblock me yourself if you really wanted, nobody forced you to make this block. Not even Black Kite thought it was necessary, which is saying something, as he hands out blocks like confetti. I don't have any issue with promising you that the next time I want to make a complaint about HighKing, I'll use this account, if it satisfies your need to be able to track my history, if it satisfied your need to enfore a rule, even though doing so is entirely pointless in this case. But it's almost like you want people like me to sock, it's almost like you want me to break the rules, it's almost like you think it helps to have HighKing running around blaming all his woes on socks, when you know it's just one of many ways he tries to deflect attention from his own edits. What is the official story now, btw? He seems to have caught on to the fact that there is more than one person who is critical of him, yet you seem to be taking the retrograde step of going back to his old theory that we're all the same person. Can you really not see how your approach only exacerbates the issue? That it only makes eventual resolution less likely, or at least add another couple of years onto the final reckoning of just how well Wikipedia was able to deal with the sort of behaviour HighKing is by now the textbook example of. Or have you just been working around Sandstein for far too long, and you've completely lost your higher brain functions and can now only operate literally to the rule book as he does, the freak that he is. Maybe if you were truly honest about the fact that who we are doesn't make a blind bit of difference to whether or not you are doing what you should be with regard to HighKing, you wouldn't find yourself having to make these sort of replies, which must surely make you feel just that little bit shameful. You cannot really be happy that you feel have to say things like this to people like me, things that are so obviously intelectually dishonest that if it wasn't already the case, you just know we're not going to take a blind bit of notice of them? Because like it or lump it, whether you treat me as the enemy or as a whistle blower, I'm not going away, not until the HighKing situation is resolved one way or the other. And neither is anyone else by the looks of it. I don't even care if the resolution is that he becomes a good editor. That's how foolish it is for you to continue on this track. I'm not harassing HighKing in any way, shape or form, and you have still yet to establish whether I am an illegitimate sock or not. This is why you avoid the central issues like that when answering for blocks like this, instead preferring the sort of non-reply reply given above. It's just poor, Cailil, very poor.   """,0

"""::::I can live with this current variant, but since UK parliament did enact SoW, the date does apply. Please note that the table/date does not read """"since when"""" anywhere, hence my original request - and that would likely be ambiguous also, since they were arguably realms/dominions/whatever before with slightly different status. Simplest would be to avoid the question of what """"since when"""" means and limit future discussion/argument about the nuances of """"realminess"""" by having fact that cannot be disputed. Would anyone object to having 1931 in the box, but with a footnote saying that, as realm from which others gained independence, not applicable to UK internal governance?

Victims of Nat Turner rebellion

I agree.  But some would argue the page may not necessarily be racist, but, yes, it certainly is lopsided.  I think some brief, explanatory introduction of what the rebellion is would be helpful.  And if the names of the blacks involved who perished are available, then they certainly should be included.  Even the names of those insurrectionists/freedom fighters who later were executed should be included  and, perhaps, the word """"victims"""" changed to something less value laden.  After all, many of these whites and their families thrived/prospered by victimizing, exploiting and degrading blacks.  They certainly also were """"victims""""?

"(A) Yes it's early.  And the timing might be a coincidence.   But until there is contrary evidence, the timing says all to me.....  They posted once and only once about an hour after my ANI and attendant FYI on their talk page.  Presumably, they posted, saw my comment, and vamoosed.   The deal was sealed when an official ARBCC notice went on their talk page a couple hours later.   They've been silent ever since.  There could be another explanation, but per Occam's Razor I will need other evidence to think the ANI I filed was not the determining factor. 

(B)As for consensus, that certainly applies to discussions of sources and text.   Only JJ was (needlessly) agreeing with the assessment that another editor is too uneducated on the issue to contribute.  Which certainly appeared to be true.  But in my experience it's ineffective, laborious, and unpleasant for lots of other would-be editors when we approach such things by attacking WP:RANDY directly, instead of giving him the rope to hang himself through FOCCing and DR.  

(C)Finally, Stephan, you're an ed that ranks among the highest on my respect-o-meter, so I hesitate to challenge you with this but here goes.... You scolded me for discussing behavior on the article talk page.  JJ was talking about behavior on the article talk page.  Did you scold him, or only me?  He was agreeing with you after all, so I was just wondering if the goose and gander are in the same boat here?

In my closing here, unless something new comes up, WP:FOC .... WP:FOC.....WP:FOC....WP:FOC.......    I ain't gonna apologize for complaining when JJ does not do that, and I very well may complain formally if he does not stop.   Since I believe in prevention, not punishment, it would be of more help, perhaps, if you try to mentor him also.  Since my efforts have run out of patience maybe fresh blood would help, especially in terms of that consensus you were just speaking about?

"As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and administrators have a conflict of interest to various articles.   So since you  “Lessheard vanU” have personally chosen to block IP addresses and made false allegations against me and other contributing people, we are requesting clarification.   When did Blackpearl14 become owner, controller and self judge of certain wikipedia articles?  If you believe that Blackpearl14 owns and has absolute control over Pirates of the Caribbean articles, then please state that is the policy.  Why is Blackpearl14 allowed to violate wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose?  Why are other editors and administrators upholding double standards?  For you can’t have double standards, as the wikipedia written policies detail a cooperative community effort for articles and, it’s suppose to be neutral. 

Furthermore, there is no way to discuss nor talk about the reckless actions of Blackpearl14 without saying and describing what they are.  Yet, immediately, Blackpearl14 has wrongly and irresponsibly calls anyone placing anything critical or changes to certain pages she had appointed herself as self controller of, as “vandals” and outright claims that she is being “attacked”, and then goes to her peers with which to delete the talk and discussion,  leaving only the editors and administrators’ comments and self bias online, while blocking IP’s.   What is shocking that you don’t know who I nor other contributing writers are.    Why are Blackpearl14 actions being upheld?    Why is her emotional state, calling herself various names in fantasy as she selfishly promotes her personal cause to glorify and promote a cause for her love for Pirates of the",0

Wikilinks
How territorial of you to undo all my wikilinks just so you could put them all back yourself. Some of them you didn't even put back right, hence the friendly notice left on your talk page; you still have some DAB links left. How is this clearer and who does that? Who will purposely undo what a previous editor didwhich actually helped the pagejust so they could micromanage a page and do it all over again themselves... but worse. I don't get it. I followed your dance-style-on-the-card rule and I added wikilinks which weren't there before. We were on the SAME SIDE Snow. We both want a better page. Pay attention. If you were thinking clearly instead of obsessing over a page you think belongs to you, all you would have had to do after I originally added the wikilinks is fix mambo, tango, b-boying, and kalinka (they all linked to disam pages). Then everything would have linked fine. Instead you undo everything I linked. Then you (re)add links all back and end up creating more disambiguation links than what existed before. You even linked to some pages which aren't even helpful. Example: you changed """"Tap dance"""" back to """"Tap dancing"""" and """"Krumping"""" back to """"Krump"""". The only reason why I changed the way the words ended in the first place was to provide a link directly to their respective articles instead of to the redirects (not because I'm being subjective). But you change the links back so that they point to the redirects. It's not like your helping people in their understanding. All you did was link those dance styles back to redirect pages instead of to the actual articles. How petty is that. Take Bollywood for another example. Are you aware of the fact that Bollywood dance redirects to Hindi dance songs? Not to mention the fact that there's also a big huge original research banner at the top of that article. How is this article going to help someone understand Bollywood dance better than the Dance in India article which is where I linked it to before you reverted my edit. If you really didn't like it pointing to that article you could have at least linked it to Bollywood#Bollywood song and dance this time. Either way, at least people reading those pages would understand the dance better than reading an article about Hindi dance songs which has very few citations. Stop being selfish and think about the readers.

Final thoughts
By-the-way, regardless of how the show presents street dance, """"old school"""" is two words and breaking will always be hip-hop dance considering it is one of the pillars of hip-hop culture. That's a fact and not subjective. Read a book, watch a documentary, or educate yourself some other way if you don't want to hear me out. I'm going to change """"old school"""" back to two words because it's good grammar. I'm also going to remove electric boogie, take African out of the jazz dance group, and fix all the disambiguation links you added. Then I'll either make pas de duex it's own row again or put lyrical hip-hop back beside hip-hop. Or maybe do both. Or maybe not even touch them. I haven't decided yet since you have a problem my editing except for the last option. I don't know what you would settle with. Any other changes I make won't be without good reason. I think I've demonstrated that by my long-winded response to your comments. If it kills you to see me make these edits again then go ahead and revert them. At that point, I'll just go to WP:RFC and solicit the opinions of people who don't care about either of us or SYTYCD because I'm not about to argue back-and-forth on this talk page with you considering that you don't WP:OWN the page, you have no sources, and more importantly, you have no WP:CONSENSUS about a rule you made up which you yourself reneged on.

User:SandyGeorgia

The discussion is now here  having been persistently deleted from this discussion without one moment's regard or consideration for the absent individuals who initiated and later participated without conclusion thus far.

Nobody has at any time suggested that  

Zeraeph The final deletion was done by a Wikipedi Administrator.  Adminstrators have the final say around here. He told you clearly to take this through proper channels.  

Of course, to do that, you (or someone) would actually have to come up with hard facts pulled from the history of this article.  So far, not a single person, even you, has been able to present a single fact to support any complaint at all.   Even though you have been asked and asked and asked.  To every single request, you claim you are being victimized by people attempting to control and manipulate you.  

This is the fourth time today that you have dragged this topic back onto this page, even after an administrator told you not to.  Your link here is to an Administrative page.  Why?  Why not move this interest that is solely yours onto your own talk page or create a new talk page in your own Wiki pages?  

You are forgetting, I did NOT initiate this discussion. The people who did have a right to expect it not be deleted without resolution.

Their concerns are different from my own and have yet to be addressed.  

Those supposed concerns of others were voiced back in July and neither of them have ever posted again about those supposed concerns, either here or on any of 3 cabals.  It appears that they have zero interest, realizing they were just complaining and their griping had no validity.  After all, their irritation was that Sandy was removing inappropriate unfactual unsubstantiated material in order that this article achieve featured status.  Sandy was Wififying the article for Wiki excellence.

On the administrators page above, you have been instructed by administrators to use ARBCOM instead of this or any other public article talk page.  You have already refused to do so on the grounds that you cannot be expected to unearth her every single improper edit, but no one is asking you to.  Just pull up the last ten - or even the last five times when Sandy has done an obviously inappropriate ungrounded edit in this article (since the """"original complaintants"""" have only complained on this talk page).  

Strangely, on my planet, July is not USUALLY considered to include 16 August  and .

Even stranger, you are posting regularly from a shared AOL proxy server  something which would usually be dynamic and not repeated on two consecutive logins and, coincidentally,  

Note this Wiki link -  Where you had already filed your first Cabal against Sandy.  And she is commenting on it on JULY 20th.  Perhaps you can explain where and when you filed that grievance against her?  The one you dropped, requesting  it be closed a day or two later after refusing to give any reasons for your requesting the Cabal.  Your complaints on that occasion were also vague and you refused to give specifics - even to direct any one to articles and dates for reference.   

I think you will find that you were referring to the """"supposed concerns of others were voiced back in July"""" which were actually voiced on 16 August  and .

Hello, MusicTeacherClub. I appreciate your efforts and thank you for contributing to our encyclopedia.

I'm sorry to inform you that you're contravening Wikipedia principles, namely Wikipedia is not a publisher of original research and accounts must not be shared. Unfortunately, this may lead to your being blocked or your contributions being removed.

Wikipedia tries to aggregate information that reliable sources have previously published; we do not publish original research ourselves. If we allowed that kind of thing, we would be putting two fundamental tenets—WP:Verifiability and WP:Neutral point of view—in jeopardy. I advise you to save copies of your articles to your computers, particularly Learning-Disadvantage Gap, as it may be deleted from Wikipedia soon.

A less fundamental problem is that shared accounts are not allowed. I don't really know why (I'm pretty new here); maybe we've had problem editors hide under group accounts in the past. Whatever the reason, the fact that you are a group of people sharing one account is grounds for blocking.

I'm sorry to bear bad news. I wish you good luck in finding a publisher.

Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Yossiea~enwiki

Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

Eichenwald

One thing that caught my attention when I read the NYT article was the claim that Justin gave his """"customer records"""" to the Times, and they checked the 1500 """"pedophiles"""" and found they were from all walks of life.  Now, at the time Justin shut down his porn operation, he was a legal adult, and was running a web site indistinguishable from any other pay adult site, replete with the required notice that """"All Models are over 18 years of age, records on file.""""  Does that mean that anyone who paid for access to that Web site with a credit card got lumped in with the people who paid Justin for webcam performances when he was 14?  This is the kind of shoddy agenda-laden reporting typical in these cases.  Does anyone remember when the US government busted an age verification service because two web sites that used their codes, located in foreign countries, had underage material on them?  They then characterized everyone who'd bought an age verification code as """"people who had paid for access to child porn,"""" and shopped the customer list around to a bunch of other countries for sting operations.

Any reporting on alleged child porn in the US suffers from a number of problems, most notable of which is the fact that even journalists are legally prohibited from looking at the material in question to report to readers whether its content is being lied about.  It's basically a situation in which you can write anything, no matter how outrageous, about """"international pedophile rings"""" and """"luring"""" and """"poor little abused children"""" and it will get published with no fact-checking, and in an environment in which no one can be publicly suspicious about its claims, for fear of attracting negative attention to themselves.

I haven't seen a single article in the mainstream press in the last ten years on the subject of child porn that wasn't deliberately inflammatory, dripping with value-laden terminology, and full of deliberate lying by omission, juxtiposition, and innuendo.  Mr. Eichenwald's relationship with Justin Berry clearly violated almost every rule of objective journalism.  Given that the NY Times article is a single source for the entire Justin Berry story, basing an encyclopedia article solely on that article, and on derivative journalism generated by it, is an example of """"truthiness,"""" not """"factiness.""""

Here is a new revised entry to go at the top of the """"Son of Perdition"""" page representing all of the mainstream interpretations of the term for comment.

(Mormon's need not comment as it is about the mainstream positions, and the Mormon position is already covered.)

________

""""Son of Perdition"""" edit

According to orthodox Jewish and Christian eschatological beliefs, and secular historians and scholars, the concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in Revelation  and ) is used in the Bible in one or more of three contexts, forming a triunism (or trinity,http://www.nathan.co.za/message.asp?sermonum=10 or typology) of three potential interpretive references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes

Many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt [see Book of Daniel]. These scholars say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the First Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc. Even those who advocate an interpretation of Daniel that includes the Roman Empire in their interpretations of Daniel recognize Antiochus as a prototype of """"antichrist.""""http://www.endtime-truth.com/studies2.html

In Revelation  and , John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" Revelation  by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. (Revelation ) The Greek name is """"Apollyon"""" (Greek: Aπολλυων), from the Greek root word """"apollumi"""" (Greek:απολλυμι) It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" [Strong's 622] The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon"""" (Greek: Aβαδδων), from the Aramaic root word """"'abad"""" (Hebrew transliteration:שׁא), which means the same thing as the Greek root word. [Strong's 07] Daniel  says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be slain, and his body """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (generally accepted by religious scholars to be a reference to hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.

Third frame of reference: Antichrist

In 2 Thessalonians , Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to """"the Son of Perdition"""" in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. He also equated this person with the Man of Sin.

Likewise, In Revelation  and , John, writing well after Jesus and Judas Iscariot had come and gone to their respective destinies, refers to """"the beast that goeth into perdition."""" Assuming a futuristic mode of interpretation, this would also be a reference to a future figure.

In some variations of Christian eschatology, this future figure is commonly referred to as """"antichrist,"""" the """"false messiah,"""" or the """"false christ.""""

Hello. I'm part of a research group at the University of Washington. In April, we met with Wikipedians to learn what they would like to know about other editors’ history and activities (within Wikipedia) when interacting with them on talk pages. The goal was to gather feedback to help design a tool that could quickly communicate useful information about other Wikipedians. We have now created a few images that we feel represent some of what our participants thought was important. We would appreciate it if you took a few minutes of your time to complete an online survey that investigates whether or not these images would be useful to you.  Your quick contribution would be very valuable to our research group and ultimately to Wikipedia.

Forgot to mention another thing; the main image on the points of sail would be  Image:Points of sail for single sail, double masted sailboats .I recently went over the sailing for dummies book again and here, 2 masts with sails are shown for the schematic, this is more accurate (most common sailboats have only but 1 mast but 2 sails which work like a 2 masted sailboat with 1 sail per mast. In a schematic it is best to simply draw 2 masts with 1 sail. The reason why this is done (besides being just more accurate) is also because it makes a noticable difference at 180° to the wind (running); here sails are placed """"goosewinged"""", so the efficiency and method is similar to a square rigged ship at this coarse. With a image you have now (1 sail, 1 mast) this isn't possible and so the image if faulty in a way. This is btw also the reason why I myself got a little confused at first on this. I mentioned before that you could make a square rigged sailboat points of sail; with this suggestion this would not be so required; instead you could best make this image first and not bother about the other image any time soon.

This issue also pertains directly to this article since at least four users have been harassed and banned by Nescio's false accusations concerning this article. Ask him why he continues to delete this question about his """"edits"""".   

 Actually, I'd like to ask you why you (a) persist in disruption of this page and (b) won't sign in and insist on using so many open proxy IP addresses?  

(a) This is not a """"disruption"""" of this page. This discussion pertains deirectly to anyone who wishes to edit this article because if they edit in a manner that  does not agree with, they will likely be harassed and banned by Nescio and his false accusations. People should be outraged that users and/or moderators are abusing thier powers. (b) If I were to sign on under my username, it would most certainly be banned in short order. I wish to see this issue resolved for all parties involved, but I am not willing to risk my status as an editor because of Nescio's frivilous accusations.  """,0

 true cooperation will likely never happen 

cooperation is asked for but is true cooperation asked for?

I don't have any problem with the NPOV rule.  I just see censorship over and over. Wikipedia is clear:

""""None of this, however, is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views. There is no size limit to Wikipedia. But even on such pages, though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail, we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth."""" 

Now I have wanted to have cooperation and have good faith efforts on both sides.  I have listened to the other side and taken feedback. I made some changes although admittedly not a lot.  

However, Cooperation may never happen.  Why?

Here is why:

1.  Does some person keep changing the theological conservative Christianity  internal link in the Biblical scientific foreknowledge (BSF) article so it goes to the Christian right (Falwell, etc).  Would a person who wants to act in good faith do that? 

2. Would people who act in good faith send harrassing messages (""""fundie"""" etc).  

I think the people calling for cooperation yet saying absolutely nothing publically about the bad behavior of certain  anti-BSF parties are not seeking true cooperation.  What they are asking for is the minority view be trampled despite the Wikipedia policy.

addendum
The Bible says the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things.  The above devious tactics are not a great surprise.   Now you can pretend that someone is not changing the conservative Christianity link to Christian right.   You can pretend MickWest is not harrassing me with messages to my userpage I said I did not want but that doesn't make it so.  You can choose not to view duncharris's userpage.  That is your choice but don't ask me to endorse it.  I am not going to.  I am not going to exist in LaLa land and pretend MickWest and Duncharris are reasonable.  They have shown they are not and it is likely not going to change.  I can adjust to this and recognize this matter.  I suggest you do the same. 

Now you say BSF is minority.  Does the Bible say the universe had a beginning?  Do scientist increasinng recognize this matter?  Do major medical historians recognize where the Bible was ahead of its time? Yes they do.   Now I cannot help people's ignorance regarding these matters but I am not going to let it decide for me my position.""",0

 Further, two (reverted) edits on it by User:259 are claimed to be unacceptable edits.  
 Its history provides evidence on both the sock-puppet claims and the improper editing ones.

I understand where you are coming from. I have no actual proof that those are legitimate street names, but I have a case to argue. I feel that no citation should be needed for the addition of street names, and I say this because it varies. Street names vary from culture to culture, of which I am sure you are aware of. I feel that in order to provide the most accurate information about this topic there needs to be a diverse culture of editors. I hope that makes sense. Wikipedia is supposed to provide the most accurate information possible, and I am just trying to add to it. By adding certain slang names, it opens up people’s knowledge. Being a user myself, I feel that my information is VERY accurate, seeing as how I would use the terms on a daily basis. Sure there is no citation, but there is an addict that lived the lifestyle. That should be a citation enough. I hope you now understand where I am coming from.

Thanks,
 

I disagree.  If it is a used streetname, there simply are references for it.  I am sorry, but information is not accurate because the person that adds it says so, accuracy should be measured by reliable sources.  
That street names vary from culture to culture indeed is known, and I am not saying that we should not have streetnames in articles, they indeed are a welcome addition.  The thing is only, what if I am a vandal, and I want to add the streetname 'mobile' to the list of MDMA-streetnames (I could add a whole list of common objects that people carry around when being in the street, and I have seen that happening) .. from your point of view, you would not contest that.  Now seen the seriousness that you have in editing the article, and since you have taken the effort to open a wikipedia account, I don't think you are a vandal, but still the same principle would apply.

 Harper's Island 

While the statement you refer to regarding J.D.'s death is indeed from Karim Zreik, Karim was not a producer for the episode in question.  The wound on JD is quite clearly visible here within the episode, and would not have resulted from a bludgeoning.   
Regardless of what you say he is someone who read the script, saw it happen and told the actor that he would die that way. So due to that we must honor what he said for it was the way the show was going, and not just assume that since it looks like a stab that it is. Since this site is about stating the facts you need to leave it the way it was written in the show and not put your opinionated thoughts on the matter.
 There is no reference to the script whatsoever in the blog entry, so how can one base their thought on assuming the script was read by someone who has no stake in the episode in question?

"""==Another specific example====
Under Genetic explanations, WRN has written this - 

To support these claims, they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in IQ:   1. Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.
4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]

This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their """"lines of evidence"""" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the """"genetic hypothesis"""", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case.

A few points if I may.

After Arkansas Preservation redesigned their web site a few weeks ago, there are a number of issues with the NRHP part of the site.  I have found at least two instances of listings that are missing from search results, and numerous PDFs of listings are also missing.  If you find what seem to be missing entries, you can try to find them the NRIS mirror run by Elkman, which has all listings up to about April 2010 (i.e. it has no listings or delistings after then).  If they show up in Elkman but not on the Arkansas Preservation site, contact them (info@arkansaspreservation.com), they're pretty good about responding.

 Packerfansam 

Better to continue the discussion here, I think.

The ANI, in which we both participated, was closed out in June or so with no action, based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems she'd occasioned, and a promise to try to stop.  You'll recall that she had been removing references from articles to non-Christian religions and thought, sexual orientation, and sex generally, among other things; and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI, it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits.

As the matter wrapped up, I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem (she described it along the lines of """"offending one or two users"""") or that she'd actually quit the problematic editing, but after being characterized as """"overzealous"""" on the point, I withdrew.

She has slowed, but certainly not quit, her POV editing.  A partial list of such edits since then includes:

July 9
At Christianity, without explanation, she recast the “Criticism and apologetics” section as “Arguments and apologetics”, and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians, as well as a (sourced) observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth.

July 30
At Trois-Rivières, removed without explanation the identification of a (Canadian) Liberal Party politician as “liberal”, as well as a reference to another person’s being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased, without comment, mention of Hugh Hefner’s attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago.

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known (and described as) an LGBT activist.

October 15
At Ted Turner, she removed a reliably-sourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic, claiming it was “contradicted” by info elsewhere in article, when the excised information was more recent than the “contradictory” text and, indeed, nicely illustrated the point (in the source itself), which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years.

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned - see this Talk page entry from September.

I agree that the """"party school"""" edit to the University of Wisconsin is, in the larger picture, kind of a silly thing; but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from, she has made the same edit at least four times now - see May 15, June 13, October 3 in addition to today's.  And to be clear, she's not removing the """"party school"""" material but just the (perfectly good) citation to Playboy.  Indeed in her October 3 entry, she updated the """"party school"""" rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboy's stead.

So I take your point, that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on; but she has continued her practice (albeit slowed) of idiosyncratic, unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view.  I don't think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment, and that's what I did.    """,0

"Wikipediawide convention for political parties is to always translate names into English, unless they are commonly known to English-speakers only by a non-English name.  Bilingual party names are common enough... for example in Canada one can find an organization officially known as  the Liberal Party of Canada/Parti libéral du Canada but its listed on the English Wikipedia as simply the Liberal Party of Canada.

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.
Many thanks indeed for your messsage. My friendly advice would be to carefully see before any blatant reverts in future. cheers. Talk """,0

 Statement 

I was angry at what I consider to be a massive campaign against Ed Poor's RFA. I rarely, if ever, agree with Ed on anything, but I felt the opposes were over the top. My comment about riff-raff is not uncivil. Riff-raff is a child's word, if I wanted to be insulting or uncivil I would have used much harsher words than that, I assure you. Further, I felt that many of the attacks on Ed by the opposers were far worse than that, even the before-refactored comment. I was responding to my believe that Ed Poor needs to be allowed to bring his dissent to the Intelligent Design and Global Warming articles, despite the fact I totally disagree with his viewpoint. Keeping controversial articles free of being walled gardens of woo is a goal that Wikipedia should seek. We cannot allow even the most righteous people WP:OWN whole swaths of subject matter. Not to be pointed, but the greater scientific community was patently wrong on eugenics, the popular bastardization of Darwin's natural selection, at the turn of the 20th century. I've been reading an excellent book, War Against the Weak by Edwin Black, which catalogs just how it was a group of determined American and British scientists popularized this hideous science and even directly inspired the tactics of Hitler. It is a chilling account of what happens when determined scientists insist their viewpoint is the only viewpoint that matters and how uncritical groupthink led to horrendous travesties being perpatrated against our poor and sick at that period of time. My point is that groupthink is bad. Refusing to debate opposing views is bad. Ed brings the necessary questioning which ultimately results in better articles because lazy and poorly sourced material is kept out, while some space is given for the opposing viewpoint. I feel that my fellow colleagues treatment of Ed, based mostly on his behavior on another project - which by the way is admittedly slanted (the """"conserv"""" in CP should have been the hint) - was aweful. My comments were not directed at anyone in particular and were only meant as an attempt to console Ed on his good faith attempt to serve the community again. Please do not wheel war over this block. I will just go do some move to commons until it is resolved satisfactorily. Cheers!   """,0

"James Dobson's comments after Sandy Hook Elementary School 
Hello, StAnselm: I recently updated James Dobson's page to include his comments in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting; however, you were involved in the process of removing my update pending further discussion. Mr. Dobson chose to opine on this very serious and significant event merely days after it occurred, and the nature of the statement he delivered on his broadcast is very much in keeping with his views on American culture and values. Wikipedia serves a multitude of purposes, not least of which is to provide clear and (hopefully) unbiased materials that may be used by others to amass factual information and formulate their own views and opinions. I believe that Mr. Dobson's prompt commentary on this significant current event warrants inclusion in his Wikipedia page, particularly when other pieces of information, such as Dobson's delivery of the pre-race invocation at a NASCAR event in 2010, are deemed suitable for his Wikipedia page.",0

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).

"oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula. 

Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.

Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that. Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal! SM/DF's behaviour is still way of the mark. It is as if Adam goes onto wiki with the basic approach of 'now where can I cause grief today?'.

 Transistor 

Yep, you've got a bite, let's talk about it. Do not bicker behind my back, let's take this the formal way, the argument way.

What is it that you don't like about my definition of a transistor.

""""It is based on the principle of dual resistance, tending to infinite and zero, and hence behaving as an insulator and a conductor, based on its vector alignment in a circuit. It is a discrete form of electrical filter circuits.""""

It is a filter, it allows only unidirectional passage of current.

Vector alignment is the most critical part of this definition. A simple copper wire will conduct any way you connect it. But a transistor has a direction, if you switch it, it won't work.
What the inventor (I don't know him and I don't care about him) has done here is craftily created a unidirectional resistance which'll work as an insulator or a conductor based on HOW it is placed in the circuit, forward or backward.

No, it is not a simple ON-OFF thing. It is a special case of discrete resistance from amongst a host of other filters. A capacitor can filter as well, but it does not do it in discrete amounts.

 I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture. That wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty self-apparent from the way it's defined in the article (""""social movement[s] that [promote] the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media""""), and from the license used.
 The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant.
 As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal). If you want to use copyrighted pictures and such on wikipedia, it seems to me that is to ask the owner to change the license, or at least follow fair usage guidelines.   """,0

You assume a lot. I don't """"support Storms,"""" it's not personal. Storms is reliable source of a kind that requires caution: he is clearly affiliated with cold fusion research. However, who should write a book on the topic? Someone who has no experience with it? Storms isn't simply editorializing, expressing his opinions, he shows the basis for those opinions with meticulously referenced text. As with any review of the field, he cites research according to his opinion of what is relevant, and this, then, gives us a guide to what is notable in the field. There are thousands of peer-reviewed papers on cold fusion, and even more  much more  if we allow conference papers. He can use conference papers, we can't, but if he cites them, that makes them sufficiently notable for our reference. Because of the position of the field as to """"general opinion""""  very unclearly defined  we have to present everything in the field as controversial, including what is quite well-established, such as excess heat. If you don't think excess heat is reasonably well-established, you should read the 2004 DoE review again, and I could cite reliable sources that the work is sound. The claim that it's all junk research, quite simply, can't be supported from any solid source, only from what are, really, tertiary sources as Hipocrite is now using at the article, in place of the much stronger Storms reference, which is a secondary source. It's like the media reports that Fleischmann's work was never replicated.

In fact, the core claim, that excess heat was found when setting up highly-loaded palladium deuteride, has been confirmed over and over. The original radiation claims were bogus. The research finding neutrons at moderate levels was bogus, artifact and error. The claim that the origin is nuclear, and in particular that it is """"fusion,"""" is unproven. In other words, OCMV, I'm quite with the 2004 DOE review, except that the field has shifted since then, the evidence for nuclear effect is stronger, a clear and consistent pattern has emerged from a review of all the research, such that negative replications typically, now, can be seen as confirmations of a general hypothesis forming, but no clear proof that the basic process is fusion.

For example, the SPAWAR group shows energetic neutrons. The work is solid and published. Aspects of it have been confirmed, and I am, indeed, assuming that there will be more confirmation; their work, over almost twenty years, has been quite solid and conservative, they've done proper controls, etc. The levels, however, are very low, and this kind of phenomenon has always been used as an argument against cold fusion: there are all these apparently contradictory experiments. I was just reading yesterday one protest that """"all these experiments produce different amounts of heat, how come there is no consistency?"""" """"So what if you find neutrons, this is inconsistent with the reported heat.""""

Actually, it isn't. What that shows is that neutrons aren't involved in whatever is generating the heat, but that the energy source, what I call the black box, is capable of creating conditions where a little hot fusion takes place. For example, take the Be-8 hypothesis. That will generate energetic alphas at 23.8 MeV. These can cause some hot fusion to take place at a low level, indeed, it would be expected. The alphas are found, confirmed, Miles et al's work showed, way back, that helium generation is correlated with excess heat. No excess heat, no helium. Excess heat, helium, in an amount proportional to the excess heat, and the ration is at 25 +/- 5 MeV, as reported by Storms and others. Krivit thinks this is a bogus figure, but I'm not convinced that Krivit understands the problem. If you don't capture all the helium, you will get a higher figure, and that is, indeed, what is found, but with some experiments, great care has been exercised to detect all the helium, and that gets us tightly toward the expected figure from d-d helium fusion, 23.8 MeV.

One writer put this way: Fleischmann didn't just discover some isolated island, that could be specified by simple coordinates, he found an entire continent, and those who try to find the island find different things, their reports vary all over the map, literally. We do not know to what extent low-energy nuclear reactions are possible. Storms details a list of observations that it would be desirable for a CF theory to explain. This does not mean that he thinks all these findings are artifact-free.

Elemental transformation under conditions that produce the excess heat phenomena is now quite well confirmed, overall. The field suffers from a lack of highly specific confirmation; this results from the conditions under which the work has been done. Researchers don't want to, at this point, waste their time doing exactly what everyone else has done, they want to",0

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

I also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:

His 1859 book ‘’On the Origin of Species’’ posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species, but by its 1872 sixth edition Darwin had abandon",0

I merely stumbled upon an article which seemed to have two editors with conflicting ideas (Jonathan Tweet and Lima) and as such I hope to format current information rather than introduce new information. I feel I am fairly unbiased, but I believe that the lead should deal more with the definition and explanation of the subject matter than going in depth about its history or disputation.

Wondering what you think
Hello TOJ. I agree with your removal of the multitude of run times in the Once Upon a Time in America. On the other hand I would ask you to consider including the European run time of 229 minutes. Various considerations include the fact that runtime is the one that premiered at Cannes also we include both the Cannes and US release dates in the infobox and we could label the two runtimes the same way. One other thing, while I can't remember the exact time frame but I know the 229m version did get showings in the US within a few months (maybe weeks) of the short versions release because, much like the two releases of Brazil, I held off going to the theater until I could see the longer version. If you disagree that is okay this was just a suggestion. If you want to move this discussion to the films talk page that is okay too. Cheers and have a good week.  | Talk

Now that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.

You are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.

Immediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.

Your attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.

Interestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.

For example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.

You are wrong.

You also imply that I  am """"associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/"""".

Again, you are wrong. 

However, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am """"associated"""" with them, too?

As the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the """"summary"""" comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)

You say, """"just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading......."""".

I have not said """"this is all wrong and misleading"""". There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)

You ask me """"why did you use this disclaimer"""". 

I wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight """"sin"""" and """"pleasure"""" wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? Or simply just believe that if you give people information, no matter how accurate it may be, that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe, that people will flock to them, and that somehow the end of the world will appear?  Much as in """"Reefer Madness""""?

The disclaimer was meant to try to appease those fears.  Unlik",0

"""It appears that the coin might replace the $1 bill almost completely that soon the $1 bill might get out of circulation. As a result of this combined with the fact that Alexander Hamilton is no longer as well-remembered as he was back in 1928, the year that follows whatever year this happens (I believe it might be sometime around 2020) might be a time to change the portraits on the bills as follows:

The $2 bill changes from Thomas Jefferson to George Washington

The $5 bill changes from Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Jefferson

The $10 bill changes from Alexander Hamilton to Abraham Lincoln

The $20, $50, and $100 bills, however, will not change portraits.

What are your votes??

Washington on the dollar coin and the $5 bill (thus, keeping the pattern of Washington on the highest generally circulating coin and the smallest generally circulating bill).  Lincoln bumped up to the $10 and the quarter (dropping the penny), Hamilton bumped up to the $20 (or Lincoln bumped up to the $20, Hamilton staying on the $10).  The $50 and $100 stay the same.  Another idea - Washington on the $20 bill, Lincoln on the $1 coin, again, killing the penny  06:27, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Oh, and while we're at it, let's add a $500 bill.  And make our bills prettier  06:29, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I think it's quite a demotion for Washington to go from the one-dollar bill to the two-dollar bill.  18:31, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Surely being on a higher denomination (curculating) bill is more desirable? otherwise why not put old George on the cent coin  23:16, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Why would anyone want to put George Washington on the cent coin?? He is already on the quarter coin and it is silly for there to be 2 coins with the same portrait.

MrWeeble, no one in the United States ever uses two-dollar bills. They are considered rarities.  21:17, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

 ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 

Your personnal attacks seems to have no end, now I am verbose, what will be next? that I am black and you dont like it? 
After all your previously attacks nothing will surprised me.

Am I writing in chineese or are you deliberatly misunderstanding and misinterpretating anything I write to avoid the subject at hand? 
I have been stating many times that this was not a statement about personal research, and I can see that you keep repeating the same accusations times and times again, without ever taking a stand from where I left the last time, nor taking into account any of my answers. 
It make this discussion sterile and you are making of it a controversy that wasn't there on the first place, so I will ask you to come down and to apply one of the basic rules on WIKI, that stand that you musn't supposed the worse on the other users, but the best, and that you musn't bull any user away, nor use racistic tones. 
Concerning first hand experience you are doing nothing but it and all your verbose and empty criticism of me are based on your """"knowledge"""" in a matter based on your personal experiences. 
This apply to all the people who have contributed to this discussion and article without being deleeted: they are all mormons. 
On WIKI, it is a rule that selfbiography are not to be written by the person it is about, so when writing the biography or history of mormonism, it shouldn't be done by mormons, at least on ONE of the site about the subject, in order to insure a minimum of objectivity on the matter. 
You descriptions of the teaching are not points that I disagree about, nor facts that I have denied anywhere in my contributions. 
On the opposit, and if you for ONCE took the pain to read what I write and not what you think I should write or what your big bag of prejudices hinder you to see, you will realize how ridiculous all your attacks are. 
I have clearly stated that there is an official side and an official teaching, and that what is presented on most of the articles about the subject discribed in the big lines what is actually and factually teached inside the mormon church, but that those topics are subject to changement, that there is diversion from one interpretation to another, as well as there is complete denial of what was previously teached, and assertions being made who contradict what was first presented. 
As I have enumerated some of it in my first contribution, those things constitute some of the pillars of the churchs doctrine and are therefor very important, and I therefor, founded very singular that they were changed with time on this way. 
Reread me from the beginning and you might see the light. 
Concerning knights I WAS SIMPLY REFERING TO THE APPELATION AS SOLDIER OF CHRIST applying to all members. 
<<""""Your allegations about """"hidden"""" or """"secret"""" knowledge has long been an allegation by Anti-Mormons. No once have they ever proven that anything like that exists. If you are talking about temple ordinances, you would be wrong. Just google Mormon temple and you will find a plethora of sites that provide exact quotes of everything that goes on in a Mormon temple. It is hardly secret, but it is sacred to LDS and we do not talk about it...even with other LDS."""">> Storm Rider, citation. 

Do you read what you write? and do you have read what I wrote? 
Here is a very clear exemple of what I am warning you not to do so systematically: judge others on the basis of what you have been told and are well brain washed to judge as, but from what you can actually see and hear that those others are trying to tell you. 
I have absolutly nowhere in my contributions used the words hidden, nor secret, nor temple ordinances, but you have the audacity to present those words as being directly taken from my own text, so blinded you are of your own certitudes and prejudices! I found incredible that you couldnt see it on your own! 
I have extremely clearly stated, many times, and on several occasions and places, and repeated myself to death on each of my answer to your attacks, that the teaching I refer to, are USUAL TEACHING FOUNDING PLACE AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING.

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Victorian Station Master's Academy for Wiki Editors

On Oct 14, 2005, at 3:20 AM, ANTIGRAY@cs.com wrote:

Victorian Station Masters Academy
Founded 1839

Greetings Prospective Station Masters.
This course leads to an SM Degree.

At Victorian Station Masters Academy rigorous training for a position with a great future (but anchored firmly in the past) awaits you.

We will train you to be a respected Station Master (SM) in the time-honored tradition of being an unimaginative SM who unduly emphasizes minutiae in the presentation or use of his knowledge, and can narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously show how learned they are.

Our graduates learn all the basics a great Station Master must master.
You will be taught to be dull, ill-natured, and ill-humored, and narrowly inflexible in standards of conduct. The public expects this.

A Station Master must be Self Righteous, convinced of his own righteousness especially in contrast with the actions and beliefs of others and narrow-mindedly moralistic.

You will learn to be:
Hidebound, extremely old-fashioned, tedious, tiresome because of the length or dullness of your prognostications, pompously Victorian, slow in perception or sensibility, and lacking brilliance or luster.
Our graduates are renowned for having an inflexible and ultraconservative character.

We offer advanced classes in arrogance, imperiousness, and special workshops to practice irritably sullen and churlish mood and manner. 

Learn an imperious manner marked by arrogant assurance, so as to exercise arbitrary or overbearing control over and tyrannize subordinates.   
All Station Masters are taught to be MASTERFUL. When you graduate, you will have the ability to act authoritatively with an obstinate determination to enforce one's will.

Our graduates typify the moral standards, attitudes, and conduct of the age of Victoria. You will take pride in being a stuffy and hypocritical representative figure of the Victorian era.  

Applications to register for the Class of 2006 are available at all train stations during normal business hours.

""""Station Masters always know their station in life.""""

Pre-inflation unstable false-vacuum is pretty much like the massless vacuum Puthoff & Co are currently stuck in leading them nowhere.

Phase transition to our universe, one of an infinity, forms the giant local vacuum wave AKA Higgs field. The fabric of space-time is the FM modulation of the Goldstone Phase of this Tsunami inside the post-inflationary vacuum starting off in the hot Big Bang as per orthodox theory. The dark zero point energy comes from the AM modulation of the Higgs field and is in two universal forms one repulsive and on attractive. On the large scale ~ 73& of vacuum is repulsive, 23% attractive. We are only a tiny % of total after you subtract off the hydrogen-helium gas clouds of proto-star stuff.

"Hi, I didn't add mile, rather all the others besides US, UK, Canada; did you *READ* the four separate references as to where the mile is used in Canada?  Not everyone drives a train, but obviously trains are a very important part of the efficient, affordable bulk transportation of goods.  Whether or not they are in common use, they are there every day on Canadian railways and every race at the track.  This isn't a popularity contest, it's merely a statement of things as they exist in certain aspects of transportation in Canada.  If one wants to conduct a locomotive on a Canadian railroad, they had better learn about the mile and the foot or they will have a hard time getting a job.

Also, would like to point out that the nautical mile and thousands of feet of altitude are also used exclusively in Canadian airspace; this practice is so prevalent it has spread to one of the most metric countries in the world:  Russia.

So there are definitely sectors where these units dominate, pop culture aside, and they need to be reported as such.  Canada probably shouldn't be the first listing as the mile is only used in specialized sectors.  Perhaps hearer to the end along with Puerto Rico and Turks & Caicos?  I just left Canada after US UK and put the rest in ABC order because it took a long time to find all those references.  Feel free to reorder and otherwise clean it up however you see fit.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this. I don't proclaim to be intelligent, but I certainly have the majority of int",1

Harassment by Appletrees

And, this Korean is repeating harassment to the ancient history of Japan.

1. """"百濟國主照古王 以牡馬壹疋 牝馬壹疋 付阿知吉師以貢上"""" 
The document of this China was rewritten to an opposite meaning by . 

The meaning of """"貢上"""" is """"dedicated"""".However, he rewrote """"dedicated"""" in """"granted"""". 
The meaning of """"granted"""" is """"下賜"""".

 did a similarly wrong translation, and ruined Imperial House of Japan. 
 said. the 30th Japanese emperor Bidatsu was also a Korean. The section has many potential to be expanded indeed, so what is your rationale?

He translated """"大原真人 出自謚敏達孫百済王也"""". (Quotation 新撰姓氏録) into """"大原真人 is Korean emperor(百済王) Bidatsu(敏達)'s grandchild"""". Of course, Appletrees's translation is completely wrong. A correct translation is """"大原真人 is a descendant of the grandchild """"百済王"""" of emperor Bidatsu(敏達)"""". 

 2. Korean civilization 
""""The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern"""" P56  is being written. 
Via these Korean contacts, Japan opened her doors to continental culture and Chinese civilization. This also enabled direct contacts with China. 

And, """"JapaneseHistory.info""""  is being written. 
Chinese and Korean immigrants played an important role in introducing Chinese civilization to early Japan.

Though a Korean civilization was not written at all, He rewrote, """"A Korean civilization introduced the culture to Japan"""". 

 often misinterprets the source. 
For instance Shakuhachi 

""""Diplomatic and cultural exchanges between Chinese continent and Japan being common, we can think that this flute was introduced in Japan with other musical instruments that were intended to give entertainments at the court (Gagaku; court music).""""

This source is not writing Korea at all. However, he rewrote it. 
""""The bamboo flute first came to Japan from China via Korea. The shakuhachi proper, however, is quite distinct from its Chinese and Korean ancestors, the result of centuries of isolated evolution in Japan.

"Odd - the 9th Legion seems to have got a kicking everywhere it went. No, not the same battle. Clearly there are now (at least) three in Britain we know about.

Excellent to see more polish aircraft articles, but there seem to be some issues with these two:
The subject matter hardly warrants such detailed articles
A single article to cover both would be sufficient as they were VERY closely related and differed mainly in size and engine arrangements, i.e. merge them.
A variants section to explain the differences between the BN3, and T variants.
Try to use your own prose instead of parrotting references.
Avoid adding superfluous details, such as the various competing aircraft which should only get fleeting mentions at best.

Is Race Still Socially Constructed? The Recent Controversy over Race and Medical Genetics. Author: John Hartigan Jr., 2008

Here a forensic anthropologists argues that the race concept is valid and that there is obvious political bias and suppression involved by the race deniers:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/does-race-exist.html

Here's one scientist that says that: """"The idea that human races are only social constructs has been the consensus for at least 30 years."""" Referring to the Lewontian ignoramuses, of course. But then continues with: """"Beneath the jargon, cautious phrases and academic courtesies, one thing was clear: the consensus about social constructs was unraveling. Some even argued that, looked at the right way, genetic data show that races clearly do exist."""" Referring to the studies by Risch, Tang, Ziv, et al.:
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/14/opinion/14leroi.html

 Personal attack??!! 

I didn't attack you. I just corrected one small edit you had made. It isn't accurate to write """"GNR (Portuguese police)"""" because GNR, a National Guard or gendarmerie (a military body charged with police duties among civilian populations), is usually known as the Guard (Guarda) and the designation """"police"""" is almost always used for the PSP - Polícia de Segurança Pública. Finally, the PJ - Polícia Judiciária is known as the Judiciária. I didn't know we can't use the """"undo"""" button - if that was what you tried to say to me. Cheers.  

Sorry I am a bit stressed, I do know gendarmerie is a french word but your new edit was cool. Perhaps I am getting stressed cos I dont like the Portuguese police and judiciary and feel desperately sorry for the McCaan's (my own dislike is personal and as far as that isnt acceptable here at least I am admitting my prejudice), I see you are Portuguese or at least a native speaker,  

edit warring

And stop accusing editors in good standing of """"trolling"""".  Take a break, SqueakBox.  You're too experienced and too good an editor to behave like this.   

Removing a POV tag is trolling, adding it isnt, simple as that. And templating the regualrsd is not acceptabl;e, donmt do it again,   
Dude, your spelling is atrocious, your attitude bizarre, and your behavior intolerable.  Seriously - I know you're better than this as I've seen you around quite a bit.  You're obviously not yourself tonight.  TAKE A BREAK.   
And this dispute has now been (erroneously, IMHO) posted on ANI. (   

Spelling. That's so 20th Century, its called typos and it has nothing to do with spelling. All I want is for the NPOV tag to stay, its a reasonable request and its not asking too much as the article is POV. Best wishes. Cheers for the heads up re AN/I,  
Bah.  Spelling is important when the medium being used is written. )
I don't understand why you are insisting on having a separate NPOV template instead of allowing the issue to be noted in the """"Multiple issues"""" template that is already in the article.  Can you please explain?   

Oh I dont doubt the importance of spelling, its typing I find difficult. This article is so POV, I do intend to seek out some other refs but NPOV demands both sides are prevsented and as I made clear on the talk that isnt happening in this article. That some rascist editors are targetting it (eg the banned fourdee) is ample evidence of that. I am baffled as to why anyone would remove the NPOV tag, I never do that before resolving the issue,  
Please answer the question: Why do you insist on a separate NPOV template when the other one communicates the exact same idea but with less clutter?   

I removed the blue tag. I want the orange tag there and I have fully explained my reasons. The article presents one side of an argument and not the other. I dont understand what the controversy is as I removed the unnotable blue tag,  
No, I'm afraid that you haven't answered the question.  I don't see a need to for multiple templates when one easily suffices.   
Nor do I. That is why I have removed the blue tag. An orange NPOV tag was created for a reason and it should stay as an orange tag. What is the problem? Anyway I see others are now edit  warring, i wont touch the article till teoimorrow but gibvenm editors like fourdee have edited the article its POV status is inevitable,  """,0

"Editing the reference to satanism from the Ayn Rand article. 

There seems to be some confusion about the exact nature of a neutral point of view with regard to the Wikipedia cannon. Neutrality is not a licence to assert associations and intimate linkages that otherwise would require rigorous argument and analysis.

As a philosopher, I well know that neutrality cuts both ways. This protects against assertions that in fact serve hidden agendas such as attempts to sneak in legitimacy for unspeakable perversions like satanism and pedophilia. Again, the prohibition, explicit in the Wikipedia discussion of neutrality, is precisely against such brazen assertionism.

"""
Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again.  There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them.
Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information.  For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile.  These are not meant as sources or references.  They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors.  The reason that they are included is summed up on WP:EL which states in part """"... information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content...""""  IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include.  This is why they are linked in the infobox.
IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information.  This is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information.  For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am.  The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films.  Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources.  IAFD works much the same.  Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user/reader/whatever you want to call them.  Filmography info comes from the production companies.
You keep asking me for a source.  I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article.  If you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number """"2"""" next to it.  That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article.  When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered.  Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity.  The """"a, b, c"""" that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article.
That source is from Bitoni's publicist.  It's as credible as can be and is trusted.
There, now that I've explained all of this, do you have any questions?  If so, please explain which point you don't understand.  |(talk) """,0

"Another episode (Emily and her dog) 

Here is another story about Emily and her dog:
Emily was a remarkable creature. As a child and as a woman, she was in person a mere shadow of humanity, — pale, and delicate. But a wild unearthly spirit dwelt within her, and ever and again it flashed forth through her eyes in a fashion that made beholders tremble. When a child she was bitten by a strange dog, and without saying a word she went to the kitchen, took a red-hot Italian iron from the fire, and laid it on the wounded part. Her pet and constant associate was a huge, tawny, ferocious bull-dog, that some eccentric friend had given her. Every one in the house stood in awe of this brute; it persisted in lying at full length on the clean counterpanes of the beds, but no one save its mistress dared teach it better manners, for it was known never to forgive a blow. Emily, however, resolved to flog the monster. She was small, slight, feeble, and a child in years; but with whitened face, and flashing eyes, she seized the dog by the back of the neck and dragged it down stairs; on reaching the hall, she let go her hold, and instantly the furious creature flew at her throat, but promptly, with her little clenched fist, she struck it in the eye and knocked it back; a quick succession of blows followed — every one of them being directed against the one or the other eye. The battery lasted for several minutes, when the animal fell down stupified, blinded, and senseless; and Emily dragged off its huge carcase in triumph, to foment the swollen eyes. The dog loved her, with a dog's lasting, slavish love, ever afterwards lived obedient to her call, and when she died mourned as weakly as a human creature over her grave.

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.""",0

Remarkably, someone who pretends he is so knowledgeable in mathematics and physics - indeed, even stating to me that I do not know Quantum Mechanics and hence should not edit articles - could make such a terrible fumble. Without saying it for effect, his lack of understanding between the square modulus and the square of a complex number if a lack of understanding of day one material: literally, my Complex Analysis book (by Conway, Graduate Texts in Mathematics series) covers it in the first section, and again literally, my mathematical physics course as an undergraduate covered this on the first day of class.

"""I have found further evidence related to this big hoax.  

The same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual's fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author's wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! 

I do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don't know what course to take, and really don't have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax.  

There is no record anywhere else online of a Vitus Sebastian Barbaro that I can find.  There is no record anywhere else online of The Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent either.  There is no record of a """"Pugilist Club"""" aka """"Fight Club"""" at Purdue anywhere else online.

Hello Jim,

Help please. I am new to wikipedia and surely lacking sufficient skills. I finished a new article on a new subject matter """"Virtus Economic Theory and Model"""". I used the wizard to write it. It is currently in Draft form and wished to know: a) what happens next? 
b) how do I (or someone else in Wikipedia) transform this article from a Draft status to a live one?

I do genuinely care about your opinion here. We're trying to develop a coherent WP:POLICY here and this does seem to be a matter you hold a strong opinion about. When someone states his opinion that that article could be linked to all day, but then when I test the waters only to discover it's removed twice and I'm idly threatened with a block, that does quickly belie the opinion. If you think WP:BADLINKS needs to be recursive or something that's an important point of view.

What, what?? Ooh no, I don't do FA-class – reviewers are much too awkward to deal with at that level. A-class coupled with GA are my limit. And as far as this article goes, it doesn't need improving, it needs a 100% rewrite – it has become far too sloppy and contains so much trivial stuff that the prose is terrible to read in places, events are all over the place (i.e. not very well written, chronologically speaking) and it isn't very encyclopedic any more. No wonder it was delisted and no one wants to promote it, which is a shame given that this man was a true British hero. In contrast Napoleon's page is well written, has better focus, and is clearly of a higher standard. If I were to rewrite this, I'd literally spend months starting from scratch in sandbox and simply replace the lot when done. I don't think """"leadership"""" is required, too WP:OWNish. Simply needs someone to be WP:BOLD and redo the whole page objectively, from birth to death, without all the off-side commentary that currently plagues the page. Unfortunately, I'm tied down writing an extensive article on Napoleon's entire military career, and I'm only up to 1796 after months of reading – long way to go yet.. so even if I were to consider rewriting this, it wouldn't be until sometime next year, at the earliest, once this other article has been through the process of several long-winded PR/A/GA reviews, first.

"""::: Yes, that was an RPJ rant. But criticism articles really are required sometimes (here's a great example) and often they create clutter if all the separate objections to an idea are left in place. The general rule is that the minority views can be collected as a subarticle, so long as care is taken to treat them as a subarticle by somehow summarizing them in the main article (this does not have to be exhaustive), and vice versa, which probably we should be careful to do in the main JFK assassination article. And so long as rebuttal on both sides is a part of both articles, which I hope we've accomplished here by having a good section on the one-shooter WC view in the JFK assassination theories article, and mentioning that other views than the WC's exist, in the main article.In line with Wikipedia's semi-policy of assuming good faith, the creator of the new article is probably sincerely convinced that there is so much information about a certain aspect of a subject that it justifies a separate article. There is no consensus whether a """"Criticism of .... """" article is always a POV fork. At least the """"Criticism of ... """" article should contain rebuttals if available. And the original article should contain a summary of the """"Criticism of ... """" article. I know I'm going to get flack for pushing so heavily for the WC view even in light of the fact that supposedly it's not the most popular view among the general public. Unfortunately, the general public's view is not informed, and is warped by the slick Oliver Stone JFK, which no movie producer is going to spend as much money to rebutt with a movie which is true to facts as we know them; plus the HSCA shocker with the dictabelt, which got way more airtime than ITS rebuttal, later. All of this being symptomatic of one of the problems which drives WP:V toward untruthfullness, which is that TRUTH is quite often dull and not very entertaining, and sometimes it's hard to find spokespeople for it. Jimbo Wales thinks that if something is true it should have plenty of citable supporters, but sometimes that's just not the case.

I have cities all of my edits but for some reason they keep changing them with older information and as it ways in the wikipedia dispute article you should give let them have their wary and I am letting them use their source for now but they can at least quote their source correctly and not make number from the top of their heads.",0

"Ikke noget at tale om!  There will probably be more discussions about this in the future, but let's leave it there for now.
 However, I find this discussion interesting as (according to my personal experience) Stockholm with its 'isolated' location in the middle of Sweden rarely relates itself to Denmark or Copenhagen (we don't hear more from Denmark than do people in, say, London, Paris, or Berlin).  In contrast, Danes (always near Sweden) tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour.  Of historical reasons, Finns tend to behave similarly (regarding Sweden).  It might be interesting for the article (maybe the culture section?) to explain this - after all, Stockholm's only official raison d'être is to be the capital of Sweden, but, locally, there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this.  For example, Stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history (sv:Stockholmiana) and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city, notwithstanding most façades (with their beige plaster) are in fact much younger than buildings in an average European city.  Its symptomatic the new Moderna Museet was well-received in Stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in Copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention (i.e. Arken).

If you are familiar with MIS (the church's membership database), you'll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year. However, if their parents are still members, their names are kept in MIS (not as members, but part of a family who has a member) with the parents until they are 18. Non-Baptized spouses are also included. If I remember the designations for these are """"Child of Record,"""" (0-8) """"Unbaptized"""" (9-18) and """"Non-Member"""" (18+). They used to have an """"unaccountable"""" designation as well for those with disabilities who don't need to be baptized, although I've not seen it recently (no """"unaccountables"""" in my last ward that I'm aware of), and they'd also be included with """"Child of record"""" in my opinion.

Does anyone know whether there's anything to the claim that the Millerites (presumably adherents of Millerism) were interested in Cantor's work?  For me, a web search doesn't find much, and one of the things it does find is the same claim in this article from several years back.

So there seem to be several possibilities:
 Just a hoax, with a persistent perpetrator.
 Someone trying to add something he/she thinks is really true, but can't substantiate.
 An actual tidbit about the Millerites, potentially sourceable if we found the right sources.

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't. The Ballet article is currently undergoing a rewrite, and any help you could offer would be appreciated (see the talk page and WikiProject Ballet's article improvement page for more information on what needs doing).

My concern about your username (ItsTAROTCAKEbitches)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?Your username contains the insulting term 'bitches' which may offend other users.

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 If you decide to just go ahead and change your username, it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under the new username: simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page, rather than creating a whole new account.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again!    """,0

Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.

There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.

Also please read this excerpt of what I wrote:

You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get """"components"""" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function """"x"""" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni. 

I notice you said that you didn't know what """"Fourier series"""" is and it shows since if you did know you'd see that the above is perfectly correct math. Feel free to consult anyone.

Notability of Bree Conden

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

"What an irony? The very policies that are used to protect articles on Wikipedia are been exploited by some editors and nobody at Wikipedia can do anything. Nobody has any rights to stop editors who go on a rampage over an article just because of some pov of theirs, using the very policies of Wikipedia used to protect articles. I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. 

Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.

Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. 

If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. 

This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

Anyway still it is a huge effort by Wikipedia to maintain such a huge collection of articles, it does not matter if a few articles get deleted or vandalised or removed from Wikipedia just because some pov of some editors.

To Cool Hand Luke: I ask for your help as an administrator with this problem.

 From the Wikipedia deletion guidelines:

Deletion process

    Main article: Wikipedia:Deletion policy

Deletion of articles from Wikipedia occurs through one of three processes.

     2. Another quick method is the use of proposed deletion: simply add 
 to the top of the article. This is meant for articles where the deletion is believed to be uncontroversial, yet does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion. A proposed deletion can be contested by any user by removing the  tag within five days, and if anyone still wants the article deleted the full AFD process is required.

I thought I complied with this policy, it seems to say that """"any user"""" can """"contest"""" the proposal by """"removing"""" the tag. It seems obvious that this article easily meets the criteria for notabilitythe stated reason for deletion. Beyond meeting the criteria's specifics, the criteria also has a catchall inclusion rule that the mere fact that an article does not meet specific criteria is not a sufficient reason to delete it.

I believe that the proposal to delete this article was made in retaliation against me personally and was not made in good faith to further the goals of Wikipedia, and that the proposal to delete, along with the reasons given, which I believe are not in good faith, therefore violates various Wikipedia policies.

The evidence for this belief includes (1) the proximity in time to an unrelated disagreement with the user proposing deletion; (2) the user's prior lack of interest or contribution or current knowledge of (as demonstrated by his reasons or comments) to the subject of the article proposed for deletion; (3) the fact that I have worked on this article in the past; (4) the fact that this user on or about the same day and time, in close proximity to the unrelated dispute with me, proposed two other articles that I have worked on that the user also has not previously or currently demonstrated any knowledge of or interest in; (5) proposed such articles for speedy deletion and then before I or anyone else had a chance to object (Wikipedia is not a full time job for most users, who only visit the site from time to time, and note also the stated policy that there are """"no emergencies on Wikipedia,"""" the user decided not to wait for any objections or to follow the policy of allowing the stated time period to pass, redirected the article to another article, effectively deleting the original article. In fact the redirect was effect as I was typing out an objection to the deletion with a reasoned explanation on why it should stay, and when I hit save, the article was gone and my objection and response are now lost; (6) he gave me three rapid succession warnings (in bad faith, for what I believe were good faith acts on my part) and had me blocked before I could make a response to his """"warnings""""; it appears that he has dome similar things in the past to other users.

It seems quite clear in light of the above, and further facts that can be marshalled in support, that this user's intent is (1) not supported by facts or policies, (2) not in good faith, (3) in retaliation, and therefore (5) in violation of Wikipedia policy.

Recognizing this, I communicated to this user that I would refrain from any activity that was the subject of the origial unrelated disagreement, by not making any further comment on the talk page of Tort Reform. I had hoped that this would resolve that dispute but it has not, as the user had made the dispute personal.

As for my being blocked by you as per the 3-revert rule, I must point out that I do not believe the rule applies to what I did, because I was (1) making a good faith effort to resolve the dispute by asking the user to stop his vandalism and disruption, (2) the posts involved were all on his talk pagethe most appropriate place to discuss a user's (his) apparent violations; (3) rather than reply, he deleted the warnings and requests to stop; (4) did so more than three times, in violation of the rule; (5) in bad faith, turned the rule on meI did not delete anything, and technically, I did not revert anything either, I think, but was adding to previous posts, and merely included the previously deleted material as support for a NEW post.

Other indications of bad faith:

The user asserts that I committed """"vandalism"""" to the entry on Sonic's Rendezvous Band by removing the delete tags. My reply is (1) I did so in accordance with policy; (2) it is not """"vandalism"""" to remove",0

 Good point, but could try to find one that is less ugly? (no offense) Also, I don't see a huge difference between the two maps. — 

 True, the basic data seems just about the same and, yes, the map uses a less appealing style. I actually think that the more to-the-point style is better at showing the Kurdish region. Maybe the infobox in Kurdistan is not the best place for this particular image, but I believe the fact that the CIA continues to show basically the same region as """"Kurdish"""" bolsters the claim that this is the region that is Kurdistan. Note also the inset caption characterising it as the traditional Kurdish-inhabited area.  

True, but as I said before, it's kinda ugly. Could you find a nicer-looking one? —

 I hope you do not mind me asking but why is the name of the page the same as your username? You asked for help, well to wikify an article it means adding appropriate sections (which it has) and linking internally to other article which are relevant, for more info see Wikipedia:Wikify. For example in the character and history sections you could make an interwiki link on the word Villain by doing this: [[Villain]] and it would produce Villain. To link to an article with a slightly different word for example you wanted villainous to link to villain you would put [[Villain|Villainous]] and this would link the word villainous to villain.

RE: MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one.

It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki.

Ambush or Massacre?

Is 10 a """"large number""""? I personally think not. In which case this should be renamed to """"incident"""" or """"attack"""" or similar. Otherwise any terrorist attacks that kill 10 or more people should likewise be listed as a """"massacre"""". Wikipedia will quickly fill up with """"massacres"""" diluting those that really are massacre of large numbers of people.    
Agree. Renaming, per the discussion here NoCal100 (talk)

Scorpion pass is referred to as an ambush by the majority.

The strange use of 'massacre' by morris: On the night of 16/17 March ‘infiltrators’ ambushed a civilian bus travelling up Scorpion Pass (Ma’ale ‘Akrabim) on its way from Eilat to Tel Aviv. In the worst terrorist outrage against Israel between 1949 and 1956....Arye Efrat, complained to the government of the desperate security situation; of the burden of guard duty; and of families leaving. He concluded: ‘though nothing like Ma’ale ‘Akrabim has happened to us so far, the way things are going, if no steps are taken immediately, it could end in another such [massacere].

Pure curiosity only, so apologies in advance if I end up being one of a stream of people knocking at your door today, but I'm genuinely wondering. I noticed that the remedies in the date delinking case were updated based on the revisions that were passed recently. I'm just wondering if there's a usual way that the case page is updated for something like this? It appears that you overwrote the new remedies on top of the old ones, with the original date and vote totals remaining in place — as a result, without checking the history, it looks as though that were the original remedy. In a different remedy revised earlier, the new remedy was entered with the current date and vote total, and the original remedy was placed into a collapse box.

In my real physical model, the electron is a physical stress on the ether, and the charge is just apart of the mass and is apart of gravity.

I'm sorry, I don't understand.  What is the """"it"""" that doesn't make what clear?  The statement that you have kept deleting says that Trent reaffirmed (affirmed again) the then existing teaching that Christian marriage is a sacrament.  The statement does make that clear.  If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.  You'd also have to explain the significance you think you see in the fact that in this respect marriage is in no way different from the other sacraments, none of which was or could be recognized as a sacrament until a theology of sacraments was developed.  Isn't that obvious?
As for the latest edit, which said that the Council of Trent reaffirmed the existing teaching only """"from their perspective"""", that is an utterly silly, unsourced, imaginative addition that contrasts with the clear decisive statement of the Fathers of the Council, who certainly wouldn't have dreamt of adding phrases such as """"from our perspective"""" to their clear reaffirmation of the existing teaching!

""" has existed on all continents. And because it is a general name, it should reflect general details rather than anything specific. This is basically why the term prehistoric religion is not used, because it is too general.   
Oh yeah and origin of religion is very precise.  I'm still waiting for a better title.  
yes origin of religion is not precise, this is why I changed the name to """"Evolutionary theories on the origin of religion"""". However if evolution is accepted as fact, then teleological arguments on the origin of religion cannot be considered scientific, in which case the evolutionary theories on the origin of religion and """"origin of religion"""" are the same.   
First of all I have told you a thousand times already that actual evolutionary theories on the origin of religion are like those of Boyer, Wolpert and Dawkins and they are miles away from what you have been writing about.  Also the logic you present above is simply not correct at all.  The fact that human physiology is a product of biological evolution does not mean that the origin of religion can be explained through evolutionary mechanisms or as a product of biological evolution.  Perhaps without the evolution of certain cognitive capacities human practices like religion would not be possible, but the origin of religion itself may be entirely """"social"""" or """"cultural"""" given a certain state of cognitive evolution.  If that were the case then theories of religion's origin would not be evolutionary theories at all, yet they would be equally """"scientific"""" and clearly non-religious in nature.  That is to say biological evolution itself is not necessarily causal of religion, even if it may be necessary to create a certain precondition (e.g. a capacity for symbolic thought) for religious belief.  

content dispute
We have a content dispute that is mainly between myself and you. Dbachmann occasionaly gets involved switching between sides. But essentially this is between me and you. This is why we are not making progress, because we do not have any editors who are willing to dedicate the time and effort to work on this this. Consequently you are taking advantage of this lack of editors and you are using an old AFD as your leverage, because you can run to any admin, who only know the rules and know little about content. This is unfair and unacademic and is very political. Dbachmann knows very well that the articles I created are valid. He has admitted that he agrees in principal with the ideas I have presented, but simply disagrees with me because he dislikes my demeanor User_talk:Dbachmann#origin_of_religion. I had worked on the article """"Origin of language"""" using the same approach. Before I started working on the origin of language, the topic was approached from a psychological or sociological perspective filled with archaic fringe and opinionated theories. I proceeded to add the evolutionary perspective to the article, after which Dbachmann reviewed the article with some refactoring he upgraded the article to B-class. I used the same approach on the origin of religion only to be met with some of the worst hostility to knowledge. As I often mention, you had even disputed the out of Africa hypothesis, or that grave goods are considered evidence of a belief in the afterlife . Here you are seen to be making up your own theories. So I do feel justified to doubt the credibility of some of your assertions and also some of the other editors. I have always asked admins and a lot of other editors to assist in dispute resolution, but many seem content with pushing buttons and chasing after vandals and boosting their egos by blocking people, they have no interest in content. So I propose to go for dispute resolution, if you think you have a case, you should opt for it. If you are afraid and want to continue using the archaic AFD as your silver bullet, then this dispute will needlessly continue. Of course the result will be blocks of which I am the top candidate, but what a waste that would be. Who would be there to provide education on grave goods.   
You've not described a content dispute but simply congratulated yourself, dismissed the behavioral policing of admins, and fabricated behavior on my part.

Thank you Gwen for re-stating my reply to Jdlund. I also complied with your previous block. As to Jimbo Wales and his claims of """"years of disruption on this article"""", those are his opinions, however, 70% of the facts in the article are based on my contributions, including my photos of the tower (before the university corrupted the tower with it's cages and remodeling the interior to something way beyond what it looked like at the time of the tragedy. Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be """"George McCoy"""", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's """"Why Did He Do IT"""" on his website (this is the author of """"A Sniper In The Tower"""", who claimed the tower tragedy was the """"Worst Mass Murder In American History"""", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing.

Some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the East of Hodson and some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the West of Hodson. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing smoke coming from Ryan's rifle, although it was established by an expert on forensic ballistics Senior Sergeant Colin Letherbarrow, who testified that the cartridges used were of a smokeless variety. (Eleven eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan armed with a rifle. All fourteen eyewitnesses testified of hearing one single shot and Hodson fell to the ground. More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

In France and Belgium, there was a notable controversy at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century on the role of Masons in the establisment of a public school system. The idea was that since Masons were said to have played an important part in the founding of the Republic, the education system should allow a good deal of space for Masonic public educators. The educators were known as the Black Knights (Hussards noirs) because  their particular attire and devotion to secularist values. Conversely, all Catholic involvement in the education system was restricted or forbidden because of its seemingly religious character. This issue was for a long time at the forefront of difficult Church-State relations on the continent, and better access to private education was only granted in the 1980s after a long period of domination by the public sector.

Hi, my thinking has been that those stub tags do not necessarily imply nationality, and just sorting them into subcategories - The changed wording when moving into position tags (the decades just add a clause onto those) could be a problem, but the phrase """"English football forward"""" is a bit ambiguous in that sense. This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked. I would be happy to go through and change all of those if there is consensus for that wording.

In most cases I think I only changed the country in persondata when a person was in Cat:English footballers, but in this case (and probably some others), I saw country of birth and location of junior club and jumped the gun. I will make sure not to do that in future. You are probably right that it is unnecessary even when correct, although I do wish I had a better idea what persondata is actually used for.   """,0

At the very least, there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of Munsell chips. One that is in the public domain is at . The server was awfully slow when I tried to access the links with the ASCII data files; I had better luck with ; click the squares for reflectance data. This website is cited in, for instance,

Incidentally, I now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question I posed. But to really settle it, I would first need the answer to the following: was I wrong in the identification of the Munsell's color in my initial posting? That is,

What is the identity—in the Munsell system—of the Munsell color to which the Wikipedia article is referring? Is it in fact 5RP 5/12?

Having realized my probable mistake above, now I don't understand something else. Look at this statement in the article:
…professional artists, following Munsell color system… regard purple as being synonymous with the red-violet color shown at right, in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet…
In what sense are artists supposed to be """"following Munsell"""" here? Obviously not in nomenclature. Is it the case that the artists do use Munsell's colors in their work, but change the names (e.g. Munsell's purple → artist's violet, and Munsell's red-purple → artist's purple)? I'd rewrite this if I understood what is attempted to be said here.

Please leave messages that need to be read on Tony Sidaway's talk page

This bot is approved and doesn't need a flag.  Except for tests, it's inactive.

The software it runs is called .  It's open source (BSD license) and written in compiled Chicken Scheme.

Purpose
This is to be a general purpose query engine for English Wikipedia, using a simple functional programming interface to permit queries of varying complexity to be performed, and the results delivered to a nominated page in the user's userspace and, optionally, sent to the user's enabled email address.

Query language
The query language is based on scheme, a dialect of the lisp family.  If you can write a simple lisp expression you can query this bot.

Typical query functions will look like:

 (whatlinkshere PAGE)
 Produces a list of pages that link to the page.
 (editorsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]]))
 Produces a list of unique usernames and IP numbers identifying all editors of the page
 (editsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]])
 Produces a list of edits to the page
 (editsby USERNAME/IP [datetime-since [datetime-to]])
 Produces a list of edits by the user
 (apply EXPR [PAR...] LIST)
 Applies the single expression, with optional parameters, to the list
 (map EXPR [PAR...] [LIST...])
 Maps the single expression, with optional parameters, to the each member of the list.
 (list [EXPR...])
 Composes a list of the expressions
 (email EXPR)
 Sends the result of evaluating the expression in email.  The result will also appear on the wiki.

Using the bot
To register to use the bot, you must edit the bulleted list of usernames at User:TonyBot/Users to add a link to a page in your userspace.  If you simply add your userpage (User:Example), then TonyBot will use the page User:Example/TonyBot to communicate with you.  If you add another page in your userspace, then it will use that page instead of User:Example/TonyBot.

To make a query, edit your TonyBot page to add the query.  TonyBot will execute the query and edit your TonyBot page to provide a link to a page containing the results.  This will be at User:TonyBot/Example/N where N is a numeric value which has meaning only to the bot.

Limitations
 Queries that take too long to execute may be stopped before completion
 Queries that are judged too complex will be rejected
 Queries that return very large volumes of data may be rejected or cut short.

The value of """"too long"""", """"too complex"""" and """"very large"""" may vary over time in an unpredictable way.

Conditions of use
This bot is an experimental service and is provided as-is.  Queries are run at the discretion of the bot operator and subject to the operational requirements of Wikipedia's services.  It may be subject to unplanned outages, and may disappear without warning, at the discretion of the operator and subject to the wishes of the community.

All queries must be made by registered Wikipedia users, in public, on the wiki.  The bot owner reserves the right, for good reason and with the interests of Wikipedia in mind, to refuse access to any user.  The reason for refusal will be stated publicly on the user's talk page and may be subject to revision if you can somehow successfully cajole, persuade or provide reasonable reassurances.

My proposed lead paragraph, which treats the topic of the article (unlike the current lead paragraph).
""""The historical Jesus is Jesus of Nazareth as reconstructed by historians who regard him as a natural man rather than as a supernatural entity. Though these acounts vary, in general they portray Jesus as a 1st-century Jewish sage or prophet who had a following but who did not establish a religion or send his disciples to convert the gentiles. Scholars of the historical Jesus use the historical method and Israeli archeology to reconstruct a biography of Jesus. They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his. The so-called quest for the historical Jesus began with Hermann Samuel Reimarus and continues today with scholars such as the fellows of the Jesus Seminar.""""

Do you have any thoughts on the subject of tuned circuits for UHF/SHF, I am planning on expanding the page a little to make it more useful.

Yes, But I have to gather my thoughts. The trouble is that you have reverted some of my corrections to this page in your addition. Can you pleae be more careful when adding material that you dont destroy peoples improvements? BTW can you please sign your posts by typing four tildes so we know who to reply to. Thanks. 

I think that a clear need exists for the division between balanced and unbalanced transmission lines. Many aerials are balanced such as the centre fed half wave dipole, these aerials can be fed using a balanced line which is connected directly to the some old equipment or via a balun in the shack. The other option is to use a balun near the feed point of the aerial and an unbalanced feeder (This arrangement normally leads to higher losses, but it is more EMC friendly). While the use of long runs of balanced feeder is something which many people outside of the radio community are unaware of, it is a concept which is very important and WP will be better if such things are included.

Sorry I overwrote any improvements which another editor made, but I was reverting some changes which had made the lecher line section into dire state where it was not in the correct order. 

Yes but we dont want to turn it into page on Ham radio solely- its about transmission lines. Sounds like we need a page on aerial matching however, aerial feeders (bal and unbal) are I think are appropriate on this page.",0

 CAT:CSD hint removal 

I completly disagree with this statement.  It is like saying that this is a job that the admins have to do. It is not.  Having the admins do the patroling reduces the time that they have for other admin activities.  Some editors are already complaining that the admins are not doing editing since they are only doing admin work.  Having all editors do the screening takes a large amount of work away from the admins and allows them to spend more time on admin activities like doing deletes.  Patroling takes more time then reviewing the nominations and deleting those that need deleting, or moving to prod or moving to AfD or cleaning up or just pulling the tag.  Statements that make it sound like admins have to do this are not helpful in my opinion.  We should be pushing to have users do as much as they can and that's doing the patroling.   
One other point that you may be missing.  I do ocassionally patrol new pages.  In almost every case, I do not do a delete but add a speedy tag since I believe that I should not make a decision on my own.  Yes, there will always be a few cases where the decision is obvious.  But I believe that having someone else confirm my opinion is the right way to go.   
Yea, I could be more bold.  I know that my deletes are not approved by everyone given the trashing of my user and discussion page, saved by the bots!.  Maybe at some point I will be bolder.  I also skip quite a few and have also been accused of being too quick to pull the trigger.  I have come to the conclusion that there is no perfect balance.  No matter what you do, you will piss off someone.  In any case, I still try to do some editing.  If I was scanning the new pages I would not have time to do much else.  Part of the burnout problem is there is too much to do.  I think that we could do more good on the new page patrol if we could get the users to post a warning to the editors page when they add the notice.

"Criticisms of Open Source 

Should this article contain any dialogue regarding the criticisms of the Open Source concept? One example that springs to mind is Blender; the interface dictated that it was commercially unsuccesful, however, after being expanded upon by open-source development, the resultant software is still plagued by poor interface design that frustrates users, making it difficult to use the powerful software behind the interface. 

Other problems worth noting could be the lack of documentation surrounding active development that makes it difficult to utilize a product to its full potential.

 LOVES TO MAKE DAVID DUKE SOUND LIKE HE IS JESUS CHRIST I HAVE POSTED THE LAST ACCEPTABLE VERSION OF HIS ARTICLE!

David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

He has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. 

Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film 'Who Is David Duke?'

The way that I met you was by catching you in the act of vandalism, and your initial response was to repeat the vandalism. It's true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning, but don't let that embolden you. The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days, does not mean that you are not a vandal, and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted, such use does not constitute a personal attack. You are a vandal. You committed vandalism, you repeated that vandalism, and it's only been a few days since then; it doesn't wear off that quickly. I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again, but my goal was to stop you, and everyone else, from vandalizing the Operation Repo article, I feel confident that I have succeed, and I feel that the allegations of me over-stepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable. It is an added bonus, that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor, and I, once again, thank-you for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor. HellinaBucket, your account is only a month old, why don't you just throw it away and make a new one? There's nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out (If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter, read WP:SOCK, but the basic idea, is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons. If you just want to change your name, or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again, then that's fine.). Whether or not you get a new account, there is no reason for you to contact me. I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals. I continued to monitor it because the vandalism had been common before I was able to get the article protected.

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves.

 Personally, I feel there is a big difference between CLAIM and INTEND.

Summarized: EMDR is INTENDED to....

Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject's behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development.

Summary: Intention
 
Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy seeks to identify and change """"distorted"""" or """"unrealistic"""" ways of thinking, and therefore to influence emotion and behaviour.
Summary: intention

Interpersonal Therapy Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is a form of psychotherapy used to treat a variety of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bulimia nervosa, and communication disorders.

Summary: is used to treat (effectiveness implied?))

psychotherapy Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, relational intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid clients in problems of living.
I like the INTERVENTION, I dont like used to aid, as this implies 100% effectiveness??

Summary: (purpose = ) Intend.

Faith Healing Faith healing, also called divine healing or spiritual healing, is the use of spiritual means in treating disease, It is purportedly a supernatural manifestation that brings healing and deliverance from all kinds of diseases whether organic, functional, or psychological.

Purport Strongly POV. The condemnation can be felt.

 
Interventions are INTENDED, practitioners (all sorts) CLAIM. The effectiveness and criticism should, in my POV, be in a seperate section.

"There are those sources who criticize Ramana Maharshi for a number of reasons, including that his state was delusional, what is seen as fatalism, on religious grounds, that he failed to take moral stands and seemed strangely detached on some world issues and believed there were greater powers governing the world, even that he was a tool of alien consciousness, etc. But I fail to see how claims by Alan Edwards that his failure to disassociate himself from political followers demonstrates political views has any particular value here. Ramana was distinguished by his openness to people of all sorts of views, his tolerance, his patience even when being hit by a thief, and his tailoring his responses to their perspectives to the point where there is seeming literal contradiction. It is well known that Gandhi sent some of his associates to Ramana Maharishi and that in response to questions about independence Ramana correctly predicted India would gain independence. But Ramana's attitude is best demonstrated by when people came to him to complain about perceived unfairness in the running of his Ashram and where he replied in so many words by questioning whether they had come to reform themselves or the Ashram. His responses to the first Westerner, a policeman who saw him back in 1911, offer no evidence of the orientalism during this period claimed. I do not see why we would add such poorly supported criticism based on his failure to distance himself from some followers just to have some criticism or how it would benefit casual readers.",0

Being that the usage of """"Creation Myth"""" in articles (and their titles) about creation myths is near unanimous across different belief systems changing this convention for Judeo-Christian related articles violates the word and spirit of WP:WTA. A sample of the other articles are as follows: 
|Chinese creation myth 
|Sumerian creation myth 
|Ancient Egyptian creation myths 
|Pelasgian creation myth 
|Tongan creation myth 
|Mesoamerican creation myths 
|Creation Myth 
|Keeping in mind that this isn't a case of WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS since WP:WTA makes a specific example for uniform usage and the usage of """"Creation Myth"""" is clearly the dominant usage for Religious and Supernatural cosmogenical articles. 
|*WP:RNPOV 
|Usage of """"Creation Myth"""" is clearly in line with this policy. The policy states """"Wikipedia articles on history and religion draw from a religion's sacred texts as well as from modern archaeological, historical, and scientific sources."""" The latter three almost unanimously use the term """"Creation Myth"""" while the first describes it as a historical fact (which we cannot due for a myriad of reasons that I'm sure everyone reading this understands). 
|At best if any reliable sources can be found that are critical of usage of the term """"Creation Myth"""" (not myth as a stand alone since the Electoral College can not be classified as a College any more than definitions of myth, particularly the informal/colloquial definitions can be applied to the term """"Creation Myth"""") a section disucssing this criticism should be added to the article and the main Creation Myth article but shouldn't contradict usage of the term per """"Some adherents of a religion might object to a critical historical treatment of their own faith because in their view such analysis discriminates against their religious beliefs. Their point of view must be mentioned if it can be documented by notable, reliable sources, yet note that there is no contradiction."""" 
|Per the section that states """"Several words that have very specific meanings in studies of religion have different meanings in less formal contexts, e.g. fundamentalism and mythology. Wikipedia articles about religious topics should take care to use these words only in their formal senses in order to avoid causing unnecessary offense or misleading the reader."""" editors of this article have, in good faith, created a FAQ, cited formal definitions, wikilinked to the main Creation myth article (which also has a detailed formal definition) and added a footnote to the the term """"Creation Myth"""" to further clarify formal usage. All of which meet and possibly exceed the due diligence required to ensure that the formal meaning is understood. 
|*WP:UCN 
|Usage of """"Creation Myth"""" in the title has been furthermore contested after the first article RM, another RM was started about a week later to remove the term from the title, that RM also was declined and closed (albeit with some arguement and complaint regarding it possibly being closed too soon). UCN tells us """"Articles are normally titled using the most common English-language name of the subject of the article. In determining what this name is, we follow the usage of reliable sources, such as those used as references for the article"""", considering the vast majority of cited sources including archaelogical, scientific, historical and other scholarly/academic writings use the term """"Creation Myth"""" as opposed to other colloquial variants the title meets UCN. 
|Furthermore the usage of """"Creation Myth"""" abounds in reliable sources doing a quick google search shows that it's use clearly meets the """"common usage"""" section of UCN """"Common usage in reliable sources is preferred to technically correct but rarer forms, whether the official name, the scientific name, the birth name, the original name or the trademarked name"""" 
UCN also tells us """"Where articles have descriptive titles, they are neutrally worded. A descriptive article title should describe the subject without passing judgment, implicitly or explicitly, on the subject. """" alternatives such as """"Story"""" or """"account"""" imply value judgements regarding veracity one way or the other (Story commonly being defined as fiction, account commonly being used in factual / historical context). Additionally changing the name causes a loss of precision (also discussed in UCN) since """"Creation Myth"""" is the formally defined academic term and as such doesn't allow for any ambiguity (only one definition) whereas other alternatives do.

 Hakan Mild 

Hi Johan. Why do you keep deleting the link to video featuring Hakan Mild?? You write, """"it's irrelevant to the article"""". Great, if the article was about Nuclear Power Plant, I'd say too, the video about great Swedish football player Hakan Mild, showing his AMAZING skills with the ball, is irrelevant to the topic.

No I am not missing the point; I am disagreeing with you. Since he still uses a regnal name, the """"other clergy"""" argument doesn't fly. He was a pope and is pope emeritus, so his article's title should remain as close to the established convention as possible. The fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate. Nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why """"Benedict XVI"""" is the best form for a pope emeritus. In other words, in the formulation """"Because X, the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus"""", you have yet to supply X. This seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic. Also, since the article should match the other popes after he dies, what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive. Does it really make sense to drop """"Pope"""" then add it back? What is the difference? Keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than Pope John Paul II does or that Queen Victoria suggests she remains a current monarch.

As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all.

"Questions for the Wikipedia Signpost 

Hi!  My name is Ral315, and I'm the editor-in-chief of the Wikipedia Signpost, a weekly newspaper on the English Wikipedia.  I'm sending out an optional questionnaire that I hope you'll respond to.  These questions will be published in next week's issue, and hopefully translated into many languages and copied to the Meta-Wiki prior to the election.  (So, if you speak multiple languages, it'd be fantastic, though certainly not required, if you'd be willing to translate your answers into any languages you speak fluently.)

There's no word limit on any of these questions, but I suggest that brevity (maybe about 300-400 words per answer) is best.  If at all possible, answers should be submitted by 16:00 UTC on Monday, June 25 (though late responses will also be accepted).

I'm posting these to your talk pages because they don't really fit well on question pages (since many will repeat questions you've already answered).  You can reply to me by e-mail, or at my English Wikipedia, English Wikinews or Meta talk pages.

Thanks again for answering these, and good luck in the elections.

Sincerely,

 White Nationalism - Ethnic Nationalism needs to be changed/updated 

BNP are no longer white nationalists (in fact they haven't been for over 10 years since Nick Griffin modernised the party from 1999)

Please see the main Ethnic nationalism page.

Source which confirm the BNP are no longer white nationalists -

UAF articles
Mainstream newspapers (e.g. Guardian)
Politics books
The BNP website itself
BNP offical manifestos etc
BBC interviews
Nick Griffin's 2009 book 

- from the ethnic nationalism page

British National Party (under Nick Griffin has modernised from white nationalism to a more moderate """"ethno-nationalism"""" supporting British indigenism).Under Nick Griffin the British National Party espouses """"ethno-nationalism"""" based on """"concern for the well-being of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish ethnic nations that compose the United Kingdom"""" (see Indigenism). The BNP Language & Concepts Discipline Manual (BNP Policy Research, updated April 2009) states that the British National Party is """"ethno-nationalist"""" and not a racial white nationalist party. The main BNP website also proclaims that their ideology is ethnic nationalism, as do many articles posted on their website.  This distinction between racial and ethnic nationalism is also clarified in Folk and Nation: Underpinning the Ethnostate a 26 page booklet by Nick Griffin and Arthur Kemp (Ostara Publications; 2nd ed., 2009). The work contains the following chapters which concern the ethnic nationalist (as opposed to racial) stance of the party: """"Ethnic Nationalism - A Definition; Central Tenets of Ethno-Nationalism; Underlying Concepts of Ethno-Nationalism; The Implications of Ethno-Nationalism; The Practical Application of Ethno-Nationalism; Attacks on Ethno-Nationalism; and How to Argue the Case for Ethno-Nationalism"""". However before Nick Griffin modernised the party to ethnic nationalism, the BNP were explicitly racial white nationalists Goodbye, racial nationalism, hello, ethno-nationalism. Mainstream newspapers such as The Guardian in Britain have also noted of the BNP's change under Griffin from racial nationalism to ethnic nationalism.The Guardian, Friday 22 December 2006 The modern British National Party under Nick Griffin however reject racial nationalism, and strongly oppose immigration from whites (such as Eastern Europeans) to Britain (Global encyclopaedia of political geography, M. A. Chaudhary, Gautam Chaudhary, Global Vision Publishing, 2009, p. 243 for example notes: """"Conversely, """"white nationalism"""" in Europe normally indicates a racial variant of an existing ethnic nationalism.

On second thought, Max, I just took a look at the history and saw that you posted not only the link that you say you're not defending, but also the link to the material from the white supremacist antisemite, William Pierce. There's no need to keep the link on the page while discussing its merits (although that link has no merits to discuss). Wikipedia's editors know how to look at edit histories. When a link is that egregious and beyond the pale, any responsible editor will remove it until it's existence can be justified. Also, I didn't """"remove an external link """"without cause."""" I explained my cause, both here and in the edit summary. That cause was not a """"claim that it's offensive in some way,"""" but a clear, obvious violation of WP:EL and WP:RS with regard to fringe websites.

However, I've just taken a look at your edit history, and can honestly say that, outside of your edits to this article, I can't see any evidence of an antisemitic agenda on your part, so I'm going to continue to WP:AGF. However, it will be to your advantage to recognize that editors who are accustomed to working on Judaism-related articles have long experience with users who """"just innocently raise the question"""" of whether there might be racist material in the Talmud, or whether there just might be a Jewish conspiracy for world domination, or whether we've fairly portrayed the views of folks who think that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a genuine document, and shouldn't we leave the material up while we discuss it? The answer to that question is no, and if my assumption of good faith is justified, you'll have no trouble seeing why.

Again, Max, follow those links and you'll see why neither you, nor I, nor any responsible editor would want them to stay on this article or any other that we had a hand in. I'm honestly not trying to start a feud or a flame war or anything else, and I do wish you the best experience possible on Wikipedia.  """,0

Suggestions

(1) Might it be useful to """"update"""" Wittgenstein's contributions to various academic and philosophical inquiries? It seems that Wittgenstein's use of language games and place of language in experience has experienced something of a revival among some postmodern academics. 

In particular, his own transition from """"representational"""" to """"lived"""" semiotic is in itself interesting as a presage of the movement from a """"representational"""" to a """"community"""" derivation of language / meaning. 

I'm no Wittgenstein expert (just stumbled upon this interesting, if frustrating, discussion) and any credentials I might have had to the """"philosopher's club"""" have probably long expired, but a part of my doctoral work did float in and around meaning, words, classification and the uses we make of themvia semiotics. Thus I am eminently unqualified to write such a piece, though I can see a hole on the bookshelf where something like it might just fit. 

That is, philosophy did not end with Adorno, or even with Habermas. Some young buck out there, can you tell whether this connection (Wittgenstein's work on language and postmodern approaches to community-as-language) has developed at all in contemporary (21st century) philosophical work? 

Might be nice to see something pragmatic as well as historic. . .(of course they are not mutually exclusive. . .)

(2) On the issue of Wittgenstein's alleged personal quirks:

Given the absolute delight with which students of philosophy embrace all that is eccentric in the lives of the authors with whose works they are cursed to try and read (see Philosopher's Song. . .any campus)

and 

the somewhat unsettling popular idea that the most brilliant men (almost always men) are proportionately looney (perhaps explaining the less-brilliant lives of mostly normal people?) as well as

the difficulty of actually nailing down with precise sources most of what happened in Europe during either of the """"world wars,"""" but in particular the secondthere was an awful lot of bombing and burning by both sides

it might be difficult to come up with primary source material that would either confirm or deny even positions held forth in academic lectures but unpublished, let alone personal eccentricities (after all, if the people writing about these eccentricities were themselves brilliant, their own opinions of normalcy should be correspondingly suspect, see the """"it takes one to know one"""" argument)

So

perhaps we should cobble together a """"tribute"""" page to which all of the strange and probably unprovable and just as probably unimportant traits, stunts, personal traits, learned tricks and inept relationships of all such """"brilliant but eccentric"""" wiki subjects can point?

Thus the eccentricities (which, if not so important, are entertaining enough that folks will be motivated to search dilligently for evidence enough to warrant a smirk) can be acknowledged with a neat and proper cite through a proper point to another wikipedia page

the """"eccentricities"""" page itself would be self-evidently immune from the precision of source usually required of biographies of thought, (by the way, why is it we assume that someone's date and place of birth is important to the formation of their intellectual ideas?) 

and would be a riotous read. (potentially Wiki's most commonly cited article)

This might satisfy both the """"biography of ideas"""" and the """"biography of real peoples behind the ideas"""" folks by allowing the hint or shadow of perhaps something utterly crazy to fall across the screen without an actual commission of the crime of citing one wack-o's account of another wack-o (non-traditional spelling intentional).

Paradoxically, this page might already exist, and merely lacks more """"slept with sheep but only within a platonic framework"""" entries in order to accumulate enough word-weight to produce a big enough ripple when it is dropped into the swimming pool of ideas. After all, it wouldn't probably be listed where any boring (and thus non-brilliant) person might expect. . .

There is nothing about Paris Hilton Racing, her Spanish based Moto GP team!

Originally the team was called """"SuperMartxe VIP by Paris Hilton Racing"""" but that was later changed to """"Blusens by Paris Hilton Racing"""". The Spanished based team raced the Italian Aprilia RSA 125 motocycle with two Spanish pilots, 16-year old European champion Maverick Viñales and vetern Sergio Gadeo. The Moto GP team was led by Raúl Romero, with Ricard Jové as sporting and technical director, and with Christian Lundberg and highly respected Italian technician Rossano Brazzi preparing the bikes. Both pilots finished in the top ten. Maverick Viñales finished third overall in the 125cc Moto GP World Riders Championship, with four Grand Prix wins and a total of nine podiums, and three fatest laps and three poles. Sergio Gadeo finished ninth overall and achieved 2 third place finishes giving the team an impressive 11 podiums in their first season. Marick Viñales won the Gran Premio Gernerali de la Comunitat Valenciana, the final Grand Prix of the season, earning points for both Blusens by Paris Hilton Racing and Aprilia who won the 125cc Moto GP World Manufaturers Championship.

"Relevance? 

'In a New Zealand TV2 series presented by Rebecca Gibney called Sensing Murder, which aired on TVNZ beginning in 2006, three psychic mediums from Australia and New Zealand, Sue Nicholson, Kelvin Cruickshank and Deb Webber, armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders, and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases, attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. The team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims' remains.[27] Skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources,[28][29][30] and it was further satirized in the season finale, where host Jeremy Wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.[31]'

Just how relevant is this? Granted, it does provide criticism, yet it is from a television show. We are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums, so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. If high profile mediums were used, I would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.

Whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc, the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small, and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.

""":As I read the article, it is asserting exactly what you are asserting: the two example sentences are indeed illustrating the same thing. The point the article makes is that different names are used: popular language calls this thing """"singular they"""", linguists call it """"plural anaphoric they"""". Sure, it's the same thing.
I'm not sure where you get the idea of indeterminate number """"shifting"""" to indeterminate gender. I, for one, agree with you, there is no such """"shift"""" in English (unless it lies a long way back in the history of English pronouns, but that's another, and long, story). The article, however, at least as I read it, also agrees with us. It asserts there are two types of indeterminacy, either or both of which can be marked by use of they. Where does it say one """"shifts"""" into the other?
Regarding your sentences, you have constructed them such that all have indeterminate gender. The first, however, could clearly apply to 0, 1 or >=2 people, so also has indeterminate number (or is plural, per Givón). The key thing is that all your sentences involve universal quantification over the domain (or restriction) of a variable: for all people or students x in X, your sentences assert something that is true for person or student x. Because there is a plurality of x in X, Givón and other liguists, call usage of they, in constructions such as yours, plural. Because each x is a singular person (in the first sentence a hypothetical person), ordinary people, like you and me, call this usage """"singular"""". In fact, though, these constructions are distributive (one assertion to each of many people), which is why grammatical number cannot be well defined. There is no specific reference, so singularity or plurality can't be derived from a referent in the usual way. The constructions have either generic reference, or no reference at all.

Why Wikipedia Can't Work
Wikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What's more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia's philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. 

There are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I'll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past.

In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they're particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of """"page vandalism"""". 

It seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they've contributed to. Any change to """"their"""" page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What's worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In """"real life"""" they would be harmless, as they wouldn't be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. 

So an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia's articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. 

No Editors Means No Sense of the Valuable
Wikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, """"ninety percent of everything is [crap]"""". 

This leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the """"edit bullies"""" described above: 

They do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. 
They are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. 
They tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such 
This results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers, while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover. My current favourite example: 

Many Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. 

So, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out. A few weeks later, I checked back, only to find that the article had been c",0
"""

 The Lede altogether 
First of all, let my say I apologize for what was described as an """"uncivil"""" debate between the user """"Tippx"""" and myself.  I'm willing to work this thing out like mature adults if he is.  But the attitude of """"my way or the high way"""" comes and it's going to go nowhere and probably end the same. 

First of all, I have to say I agree 100% talk with your assessment of """"Currently the lede is too brief to do this job properly, which perhaps gives the impression that mentioning the detainee incident so prominently is giving undue focus to one particular event"""".  That's exactly the impression I got.  I felt Tippx was trying to put too much emphasizes on something controversial partly b/c at the same time, he insisted a couple facts in the Early Life section were """"overwhelmingly positive"""" as he stated. 
But forget the Early Life section for now. 

Lets talk about improving the Lede section because I agree it does need improving. It's just a bunch of short complete sentences. Which is why if you look at my edited version, I combined some to make it flow while also adding in diminutive additional facts but at the same time. I didn't make one fact override the other.  I listed basically the Key things about West's career and that was it. Nothing was more emphasized. And I actually, as you can see, came to agree that West's exit from the military did need to be mentioned but to a certain degree. While that is a Key thing in West's career, it's one of many. I listed he won this past election but also lost his first election; Listed after he retired, the jobs he took up before his first bid for election; And I did it all in chronological order.
Felt it was balanced, cited, and edited well. But ofcourse, the user reverted it and his only explanation was a different one """"sounded better"""".

But off of that, and onto how we can get it right...

First of all, I'll be clear... It's legitimate and cogent, and I'm going to insert back, the fact that former Congressman Josiah Wall was the last black Florida Congressman and also the last EXACT YEAR is substituted for """"In November 2010 he was elected as the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since the 1870s."""". It's not that much more lengthy and listing the exact year and the last person, who indeed was the last black Rep from Florida, I feel does no harm and doesn't for a sec take a viewer completely out of the main subject. And also, justified to just say in the """"2010 Mid-term election"""" rather than """"November 2010"""". Everyone knows our elections are in November but when a reader 15 years from now may be reading, the fact it says mid-terms will immediately thwart the curiosity of whether this subject's election triumph was in a Presidential Election year or Mid-Term year.

And it also it's rational to just put he's """"Republican Representative-elect....."""" rather than """" """"He's Representative-elect from Florida....."""" and the """"He is a member of the Republican Party"""". Those can EASILY and rationally be combined. No requisite for deliberation there.

As far as what   and (talk contribs) say about the interrogation incident. Qwurxian, your statement of """"you cannot factually state that it was due to pressure, that it was to preserve his benefits, because he was afraid of being convicted, or any other reason.....""""...... I guess one would feel we need an exact statement from West's mouth as to EXACTLY WHY then OK, I guess find a statement by him saying WHY, but one would assume it was at least two if not all three of what you mentioned by simple coherence. We'll leave that open.

And we'll leave else to be be dealt with. 

And we can figure out how to combine and get the right Lede we're looking for as well as anything else.

"""in this context, and certainly would not think of looking for an article entitled """"Massacre of Braybrook Street"""" in this context.  Roberts has been inside for more than forty years.  Again, many people will think that not unreasonable in the context of his crime.  Roberts is engaged in petitioning the courts for a release date under the Human Rights Act.  This in turn will lead users to look to this article for biographical details.  The facts about his career in prison are irrelevant to an article about the crime he has committed, they belong in a biographical article.

Against that, biographical details of Roberts are slim.  He committed his crime aged thirty, hid out for a few months, and has been in jail for forty years.  Prior to the crime, he had done little of note to appear in a biography.  He has done very little of note for forty years.  Some more detail about his earlier life is probably available, but it would need a lot of leg-work around newspaper cuttings libraries to find it, and many newspaper archives of this nature went in a skip years ago without digital copies being made.

et tu JamesMLane?? I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing.

But you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence. To suggest that I'm some knee-jerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way. I

'm here to remove POV. Period. Now, it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing, although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a left-wing cabal and a sinister one at that!  
(Remember, you can't say you were 'just joking' because, as we've learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece, unless you SPECIFICALLY say 'I was joking' when you make your statment, it means you're as serious as AIDS- so I thank you for that illuminating revelation. It is duly noted.)

Anyway, it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left. Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole?

As for your arguement - """"we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion, an article-within-an-article that discusses the subject he addressed..."""" I can only say McCain...Black Baby Rumor...see above. lol! 

I find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke. It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles. I wish you'd use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherry-picking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated.

So, I reject your argumentation for now. In fact, I've understood that Move-On's petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to. Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default.

And I think one 911 family group comments deserves another. Or, if you like, we can just use the conservative 911 family group's statements. Since we  don't want to make this article 'book-length' do we?

And what I've seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if it's good for the goose (democrat/liberal) and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander (republican/conservative.) I hope you don't think I'm the only one who sees this. (Oh btw, when I make post these trenchant observations, I'm used to getting rebuked for 'getting away from content' or 'talking politics.'

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

 Archived clarification 

 Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.    
Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?   
The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.    
Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking.
Ridiculous...   
To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.

==Why 'Neo'-Darwinism==
 
There is no one theory of Neo-Darwinism. The term is commonly used to refer to currently accepted mainstream ideas about evolution  , which cannot properly be called 'Darwinian' since Darwin's hypothesis regarding the origin of the variation necessary for natural selection, which he called Pangenesis, is no longer accepted by most geneticists.

Darwin recognised several problems with his theory, which he was unable to solve. In 1859, when his seminal book The Origin of Species was published, nothing was known of DNA or genes, and very little about cell biology. He could not conceive of Mutation which is now considered to be the source of novel material in the evolutionary process. His theory of Pangenesis, which he published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, hypothesised that Gemmules, his imagined forerunners of genes, carried information to the next generation by accumulating in the germinal cells or zygotes and that they changed in response to use or disuse of the organs from which they were thrown off. Though Darwin did not acknowledge any debt to Lamarck, this was essentially a form a Lamarckism, now rejected by most mainstream scientists.

Despite the title of his book The Origin of Species Darwin did not explain speciation, and he recognised a problem. For natural selection to produce adaptive evolution, he considered that the changes in individual organisms that were the material for selection had to be small. Only then could successive generations move towards an optimum state for any trait. If the changes, whatever their origin, were too large, then they would constantly 'overshoot' the desirable optimum, producing offspring that were forever badly adapted. This requirement for small change or Gradualism seemed destined to lead to stabilising selection, which was inconsistent with the observed fact that different species have somehow broken away and become very different from each other.

Darwin also assumed that characteristics were the result of 'blending inheritance'; the mixing of contributions of both parents. In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, he presents abundant evidence from animal and plant breeders, as well as common experience with human offspring, suggesting that in general some sort of average of the two parents was produced, though he recognised sports or throwbacks as the exception that was to him a mystery. He could not see how such blending might lead to anything other than the gradual dilution of variation, to the point of eventual elimination, which conflicted with the possibility of speciation. >

== History and Useage ==
The Ukranian I. I. Schmalhausen used the term in his seminal work Factors in Evolution which his colleague Theodosius Dobzhansky, described by Steven J. Gould as the central contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis described as very important to the synthesis. He says, (p175) """"The Lamarckians based their theory on the premise of an already existing individual adaptability and did not examine its origin while the Neo-Darwinians regarded it as unimportant since they assumed that the results of individual adaptability, being non-inheritable, have no evolutionary value."""" He also says, (p198), """"Unfortunately, the more recent advances of genetics have promoted the spread of neo-Darwinian concepts. Morover, adaptive modifications generally have not been accorded any place among the factors of evolution.""""

The widely used school textbook Biology a Functional Approach says: """"The Darwinian theory reappraised in terms of modern genetics is sometimes called neo-Darwinism.""""

Richard Dawkins uses the term to when referring to current ideas, saying """"that idea means quite a complicated mixture of things"""" but does not explicitly distinguish it from the ideas of the modern synthesis .

Steven J. Gould, one of the most published evolutionary theorists of modern times, used the term neo-Darwinism frequently .

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

 Page content for footprints poem 

Why do you keep removing this text? These are important facts
about this poem and about the authorship. There has been so much public deceit and this is nothing but pure sabotage when you cannot even give me credit for my own work. 

Footprints, also known as Footprints in the Sand, is a popular allegorical text written in prose. Although released as an """"anonymous contribution"""", it is often mistakenly attributed to Mary Stevenson or Margaret Fishback Powers. Carolyn Joyce Carty is the only author of the most popular version known as Footprints poem; One night a man had a dream whose copyright actually reflects it's anonymous contribution of authorship. See U.S. Copyright Record. 

There also seems to be a critical error when stating that neithr Ella Scharring Hausen or Mary Stevenson never claimed their own copyright that it was only claimed for them by others. What kind of nonsense is that? Mary Stevenson vicariously tried to claim authorship of Hausens public domain version.

 HST > Notable? 

832, In the heading it says: """"Notable roles"""". The three previous mentions were roles that the play and/or film, Truman was the main subject, taking up the bulk of screen/stage time and lines. These also won critical acclaim. The combination of the amount of script and praise is what made these portrayals of Truman notable. Does your addition really fit: """"Notable""""? There have been lots of roles with Truman in them:

Flags of Our Fathers (2006) Played by David Patrick Kelly (as President Truman)
Hiroshima (2005) (TV) Played by Kenneth Jay (as Truman)
The Messenger: Based on a True Story (2005) Played by Raymond Starzmann (as President Truman)
Keep the Faith, Baby (2002) (TV) Played by Cedric Smith (as U.S. President Truman)

J. Edgar Hoover (1987) (TV) Played by Walker Edmiston
Eleanor, First Lady of the World (1982) (TV) Played by Richard McKenzie
Inchon (1981) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)
Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) (TV) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S Truman)
""""Backstairs at the White House"""" (1979) TV series Played by Harry Morgan (as President Harry S. Truman)
MacArthur (1977) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)... aka MacArthur, the Rebel General (UK) 
Tail Gunner Joe (1977) (TV) Played by Robert Symonds (as President Harry S. Truman)
Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders
Truman at Potsdam (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S Truman)
Collision Course: Truman vs. MacArthur (1976) (TV) Played by E.G. Marshall (as President Harry S Truman)... aka Collision Course (USA: short title)

The Man from Independence (1974) Played by Robert Vaughn (as Harry S Truman)
The Beginning or the End (1947) Played by Art Baker (as President Harry S. Truman)

But, Give 'em Hell, Harry! and Truman, both on stage and screen where entirely about Truman. In Give 'em Hell (if you have seen it), there is nobody else. It is a one-man play, 100% of the lines are portraying Truman. And Flanders played Truman at least four times, including the bulk of the work being about him in at least two occasions; Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking and Truman at Potsdam. So, is his charactership in Flags of Our Fathers really """"notable""""?

 Videology page deletion 

Hi there. This is regarding the deletion of the Videology article I posted yesterday. The reason given was because there was """"no explanation of significance."""" I was wondering if I could get more clarification.

According to A7 of the Criteria for Speedy Deletion article, an article must demonstrate why the subject is important or significant. It also states, """"The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible."""" In terms of credibility, it appears clear that the subject of the article has been covered by credible and reliable sources such as the New York Times and revered advertising and technology trade publications such as AdWeek and Tech Crunch.

As an aside, I'd be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles, such as TubeMogul, YuMe and Adap.tv. Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies, especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology.

I'm very interested in discussing this further with you and completely amenable with any suggested ways to improve the article on the subject matter.

Thank you for your help, time and assistance.

Yoruba population is above 40 million . My reason is base of govt figures. Please visit http://www.nigpost.com to see villages, town and cities in Nigeria.

Count the number of villages, town and cities in nigeria and compare this with the yoruba figure of Oyo, ogun, ondo, ekiti, osun, lagos, kwara, Part of Kogi, and part of edo state. You would see that the yoruba have about 40% of the settlement in Nigeria. And when you compare comparison statictics from the office of statictics from radiom sample. The yoruba are 30% of the poulation but because of Hausa/fualni  Military govt, who have alter the census to favour themself.

"I just tagged the ones you marked.  However, before we take this to a more public review, I would like to hear why you think those images should be allowed to stay.  No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.

 As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.

 In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.  Hence, you'll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted.",0
"I took out your Frank Knight bit because it was only about him translating Weber, not about Weber's influence on his thought. If you find reliable sources to cite Knight being influenced by Weber, that information is appropriate for, say, the Legacy section. However, I would ask that this kind of expansion be saved for after the GA process. 
A general note: if mainstream thought today puts Weber in the sociology box, then that is the article's main stance. Wikipedia ideally mirrors mainstream thought. We also make note of significant minor viewopoints, observing the proper weight of those viewpoints in relation to the mainstream. There is certainly room in the article to describe Weber's influence in economics.",0

Thank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”.

“This section was started with discussion of """"bias in favor of Darwin's theory"""" raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”

I certainly agree with that. 

But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).

Now,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).

Anyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?
