 Questions about a certain [reversion] edit   

I have some questions about this edit. 

I did not remove the character string that [supposedly] is the title.  That is, the string that is the title according to the """"edit comment"""" which says: """"um, no, the title is the line above that"""".] 

On the other hand, this edit (see above) did remove the character string that (IMHO) was a better title.  (That is, the string that I thought was better, as [all or part of] a """"title"""" for the web page with the URL of http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=128944 .) 

I am not immediately ready to """"insist"""" that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice.  (However, if you have any comments about that """"idea"""", I am willing to listen.)  

I am prepared to try to reach some consensus.  Is there anything we can do to explore (or discuss) (or, explain to each other) the goals that are [perhaps] to be achieved by choosing well, [and carefully] which character string to use as the """"title""""?   (or, maybe that should say, << the goals that are """"more nearly"""" to be achieved >> by doing so) (- ? -). 

Would it benefit anyone (perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals?) if one of us were to explore (or discuss) (or, explain) the reasons why the use of the character stringSabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 for the """"title"""", would be better? 

Do we both understand (thoroughly and well) what each word of that """"title"""" means, and what its role is, in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for?  (such as, describing the """"topic"""" of a certain web page, and informing the reader a little bit, what a certain web page is """"about"""" - ? - ) 

Do we both (or, do any of us) think that this """"title""""Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 comes closer to describing the """"topic"""" of the web page, or otherwise (in some sense) doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is [/slash, """"should"""" be] helpful for? 

Have both of us [sufficiently] considered the question of what the web page with the URL of (value of the """"url"""" field) is about?  IMHO, it comes pretty close to being about """"Palmetto"""".  I could be wrong... 

I hope this does not sound [too] negative.  I hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something, that is not already known (at least, something that we don't both already know).  So, maybe there is hope for a happy, win-win outcome, that will be the best for all concerned.  (It would even be fine with me, if [after reaching some consensus successfully] we were to nuke this whole section, if [e.g.] we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any """"archive"""" files.) """"No harm / no foul.""""  (getting in to """"history"""" logs,  or, """"remaining"""" in them  might be a different matter.) 

You are welcome (btw) to answer some questions that I did not [know to] ask.  (""""if any"""").  

The kindness of a response (and/OR an edit that restores the word """"Palmetto"""") would be appreciated.  Thank you.    """,0

Up until now, the lead for this article has read like a press release for the PIRA, which I guess is the reason that we have such vociferous objections to including a documented fact about this organsition within the lead.

 Self-aggrandizing POV? 
The phrase 'self-aggrandizing' has been removed several times for two reasons:
It's [[WP:POV|POV].
It's redundant, apparently because it's made clear by the rest of the article.
I'm not sure either of these reasons are valid.  What POV is the 'self-aggrandizing' phrase pushing?  It doesn't seem to be something either the GNAA's supporters or detractors would disagree with, making it unclear whether or not it's POV at all.  It seems to simply be an indisputable fact, evidenced by, among many other things, the article itself as well as the GNAA's website.  Also, if the statement is not POV, it can't be said to be inappropriately unbalancing the article by including the POV of one side and not the other; that the GNAA are a self-aggrandizing group is a simple fact.

Another reason given for the phrase's removal was that it was redundant.  That might be the case, but isn't redundancy not only acceptable, but desired in the first paragraph of an article, which is generally supposed to act as a summary?

I'm really not sure why this phrase is causing so much controversy.   """,0

Yes, it is implied, but I dislike implications within a definition, even when they are correct. And I believe a general reader may share the sentiment, or even get confused.

Decades ago, before computers, it was important to make simple equations even simpler. To that aim, static equilibrium was used in some accelerating system problems, of course with the inertial forces included (the approach was credited to dAlembert). A simple example would be to determine maximum acceleration of a motorbike for a given friction coefficient (no limitation on engine power). When solved in the accelerating frame in which the center of mass was at rest, one could use torques about any point (as both static equilibrium conditions apply) and achieve minor simplifications in calculation. As I recall, one would casually refer to that accelerating frame as """"the motorbike CM frame"""". Why not, the meaning was perfectly clear, and what authority might there be to forbid such usage?

That being said, I am aware of the fact that relativistic particle collisions are best described in inertial COM frames. Some authors call them """"COM systems"""", as e.g. in the Sears and Zeemansky College Physics. (They even claim that """"COM system"""" is a relativistic generalization of """"CM system"""" - people will use various conventions.)  """,0

 3. It is speaking of the inappropriateness of meditation from a pediatric standpoint (supposedly - I haven't read it).

Most of the last edit seems to belong to the talk page rather than in the article, so I have moved it so I can be discussed.

Broader context
Use of the term """"psychoanalytic theory"""" implies that there is a core theory which is complete by itself.  This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) """"Biology and the future of psychoanalysis"""", Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.

Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.

This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).

Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.

Suggestions for the peer-review
The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal """"theory"""" of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences.""",0
"See on Becher  and various other pieces of original research on the Web. It seems likely to me that Becher had plenty of local recognition as a military leader, but no status in the eyes of London. There is further Pollard's suggestion that Thomond took over from 1605. More likely Brouncker had the nominal title, but had made such a bad job of the position that he had little power on the ground. The article should reflect the reliable sources, naturally.",0

 Distribution of Obscene Material to Minors 

Dear Anthere-

I am very pleased with this service, and have used it a great deal.

Unfortunately, it occurred to me to check on some of the articles that my children might utilize, and was quite badly shocked.

From what I can tell, this site is not in compliance with the applicable regulations of the State of Florida (or my own state, Virginia) concerning the distribution of pornography to minors.  Obviously, that is a decision to be made by the appropriate legal authorities.  Given that I do not wish to be complicit in what is apparently an illegal activity, I am ending my contributions to this site.  It is my hope that this encyclopedia will be a resource for our children as well as ourselves.

I would very much like to continue to participate, and I certainly recognize the impossibility of immediately censoring any article which breaks a law anywhere.  At the same time, reviewing your policy pages it appears that a very few people are responsible for this behavior, and that no coherent policy is in force.  Additionally, given the size of the effort, it is difficult for me to appreciate that the word """"consensus"""", which appears quite often, is being used appropriately.

While I obviously worry for my children's welfare and upbringing, I am more concerned, at this juncture, in being involved in an activity with appears to be illegal (to whit, a class 3 felony in the state of Florida).

I understand your policies on censorship.  At the same time, most pornography web sites carry disclaimers regarding """"you must be 18 years or older to enter, click here to so state"""".  Given that there is no such disclaimer, and that the inclusion would harm the effectiveness of this site, I am at a loss for how you should proceed.

I have, on my user page, outlined the various agencies to whose attention I would like to bring this matter to, and offer you, as Chairman of the Wikifoundation, the opportunity to discuss this with me before I take these actions.  I am quite sure that the majority of members have no interest in participating in an activity which would appear to be other that what it is:  an encyclopedia.

My best wishes for yourself and your family.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

From Wikipedia:

What counts as a reliable source
Further information: Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources
The word """"source"""" in Wikipedia has three meanings:

the type of the work (some examples include a document, an article, or a book)
the creator of the work (for example, the writer)
the publisher of the work (for example, Oxford University Press).
All three can affect reliability.

Base articles on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is """"made available to the public in some form"""".[6] Unpublished materials are not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. The best sources have a professional structure in place for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.

If available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

Editors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:

university-level textbooks
books published by respected publishing houses
magazines
journals
mainstream newspapers.

  
Editors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria. See details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources and Wikipedia:Search engine test.""",0

I agree with your assessment of the Austen article (obviously). I was planning to do just what you did when I got to my dissertation chapter on Austen. However, I recommend that when the article is complete, that you post a message to the talk page of the Jane Austen article and ask people to comment on your page and invite them to improve it. Replacing the whole page might not be viewed as being bold but as a unilateral assertion of authorship. I know that you have no such intention - I am just letting you know what might happen if you did that.

Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.  

Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be """"little known"""" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.  

He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.

My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.

Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.  Wildhartlivie did a great job on the man's resume, but let's be realistic about who would have given a damn about his daughter's death a month after it happened.   """,0

Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as """"integral thinkers"""", doing work that is called """"Integral Studies"""", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or """"Integral (AQAL)"""" and """"Integral"""", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:
...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has """"mutually influenced"""" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called """"Integral theory (Wilberian)"""" or """"Integral theory"""" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? 
I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

 rework begun 

I suggest to rework the """"Initial theories"""" section along these line:

First
First I suggest to delete the Technical failure section and move the relevant information (that the plane was fine) to the Investigation section under a new title and with the following text:

 The Plane 

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M, construction number 90A837, was manufactured at Kuibyshev aviation plant (No. 18) on 29 June 1990 for the Polish Air Force.
It was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; this aircraft—with a tail number of 101—was for presidential use, while another—marked 102—is used by the prime minister. The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009 and Aleksey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The airplane had received a 5-year/7500-flight-hour warranty after the overhaul yet the crash happened after just 138 flight hours.

Second
As second part of the rework I suggest to edit half of the VIP passenger syndrome section away and put the remaining paragraph last in the section Investigation:

There has been some speculation in the press, that the planes pilot was under pressure to land in Smolensk in spite of the averse weather conditions. These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: """"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly"""". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind. Pietruczuk continued to fly the president's plane after the incident, even after Kaczyński expressed unhappiness with his performance during the flight to Tbilisi.

Third
Thridly I would shorten the Instrument landing system incompatibility section, rename it and definitely delete the """"may be using"""" part and put the resulting section directly under the the section """"The",0

 2013 Constitution 

The last sentence in the lead section says:
The elections were to be held under the new constitution which gave fairer rights to native Fijians, lowered the voting age to 18 and gave the right of multiple citizenship to Fijians for the first time.
I'm not sure what that's meant to refer to. (Particularly as it's unsourced.) In no sense were indigenous Fijians deprived of """"fair rights"""" prior to this Constitution. On the contrary, it's the Indo-Fijian minority which, from the late 80s to the mid-2000s (and arguably even before that) was subject to suspicion, discriminatory measures, and (very occasionally) racial violence. The stated reason for the 2006 coup was to remove an indigenous supremacist government, and put an end to racial politics and discrimination. I'm consequently removing that part of the sentence.

 What are you talking about? What you did is the fill-in-the-blank question:
Gusuku ... often refers to castles or fortresses in ______ that feature stone walls.
 And your answer is """"the Ryukyu Islands."""" That's wrong in the sense that we wouldn't say, """"We speak Germanic"""" when we actually speak English. Castles or fortresses that feature stone walls are typical of Okinawa. Applying the term to other island groups is highly problematic to say the least.
 Narratives about gusuku are truly chaotic. No wonder you don't understand the situation correctly. No one can define the meaning of gusuku, which reminds me of family resemblance. What's why I avoided the """"A is B"""" definition and used """"A often refers to B"""" in the article. Explaining many conflicting theories as I did in the article is confusing. So I present just one hypothesis which I personally support:
 The word gusuku originally meant stone walls that, say, partitioned agricultural fields. In other words, the word gusuku was not associated with castles. This meaning survives in Yaeyama.
 There has been a long tradition of mountain cult. At first, the word gusuku was not associated with mountain cult.
 In Amami, medieval mountain fortifications, that are typical of mainland Japan, were constructed, probably in response to Ryūkyū's repeated invasions. At this stage, the word gusuku was not associated with these mountain fortifications.
 In Okinawa, some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls. One consequence of the fusion of mountain cult and fortification was the association of the word gusuku with mountain cult and/or fortification. The association of gusuku with stonework was weakened, but anyway Okinawa's castles and fortresses had stone walls.
 Ryūkyū finally conquered Amami and introduced the noro ritual system to Amami. The new meanings of gusuku (1. related to mountain cult, 2. fortification) were also introduced to Amami. Most of the former medieval mountain fortifications were abandoned, but some were transformed into sacred places and given the name of gusuku even though they lacked stone walls. Some people of Amami might have interpreted the word gusuku as fortifications regardless of whether they had stone walls. Others reinterpreted the word as a sacred place regardless of whether it had stone walls. For this reason, some gusuku are on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves.
 Archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture re-used the word gusuku as a technical term (yet another meaning). This was the source of confusion. They referred to Okinawa's castles and fortresses that feature stone walls as gusuku. They met fierce oppositions from folklorists because their use of gusuku was not grounded in people's actual usages.
 Some archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture attempted to extend the gusuku-as-fortifications framework to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama, regardless of whether local people referred to the target as gusuku (The remains of human settlements of Yaeyama are not called gusuku by local people either). They met fierce oppositions not only from folklorists but also from fellow archaeologists.
 It is convenient to consider a dichotomy between inductive and deductive reasoning. Linguists, folklorists and ethnologists base their arguments on people's actual usages and try to infer a generalized conclusion from them. By contrast, archaeologists often define a term, independently of people's actual usages, and apply it to those which meet the definition. Due to lack of written materials, archaeologists need to name archaeological findings by themselves. So they naturally clash with scholars from other disciplines.
 It is important to note that the gusuku-as-fortifications framework (that's what the lead sentence says) is no longer supported in the archaeology of the Amami Islands. The renaming of so-called """"Uragami Gusuku"""" was a symbolic event. A gusuku is a gusuku only because people refer to it as such. It's not because the referent meets some definition. In Amami, gusuku (as a technical term) is dead, long live gusuku (as to people's actual usages)!   """,0

Well I had the idea that adding content to wiki was what was expected. I fail to understand the """"pure genius"""" comment other an attempt to be nasty. I may add that his 2 essays on Baudrillard were accepted for publication at the International Journal of Baudrillard Studies: http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/ so your testimony to their worthlessness seems silly and rather petty of you. Yes I created this page and 2 more (Frank Popper and Ebon Fisher) but after this experience there will be no more content supplied by me. There are NO claims of """"global influence"""" - only specific facts concerning all three pages I created for you. If you object to my linking his early work to punk - then remove that reference but please stop your pettiness.

 Rydernechvatal

I think you dodge the issues at hand completely. The issue here is the integrity of the online encyclopedia. To place Nechvatal into the field of collage artists, on par with Matisse, is patently disrespectful to this project. There are thousands of artists who do collage, and very few deserve mention on Wikipedia. My brother is an artist but you won't find me putting him all over Wikipedia! He just doesn't have the stature required. That's not a criticism of his work (or of Nechvatal's), it's a statement about what an encyclopedia is for. May I suggest you build Nechvatal a nice MySpace page?

Similarly, to place a 2 page review on Baudrillard alongside the remarks of Susan Sontag is not helpful either. The point of the encyclopedia is not to list every possible thing connected to Baudrillard (in which case Nechvatal's piece would qualify); the point is to discuss and link things which help introduce and illuminate someone at the scale of an encyclopedia. There are thousands of published articles on Baudrillard and very, very few of them have a place on Wikipedia. The same is true of punk visual art and so on and so forth.

You really don't own up to any of this. This is why the charge of pettiness applies well to you: if you truly took responsibility, you would remove your additions and links yourself, rather than ditching this chore to the community. But that's the basic misunderstanding here: Wikipedia is not about individual promotion, by self by fans or by family, it's about a community of people building knowledge in a collaborative way.Dylanfly 

Nechvatal, as a collagist, is discussed in Brandon Taylor's recent book """"Collage"""" published by Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2006, p. 221. Perhaps your brother is in that book as well? Thus I have nothing to own up to.

For the first citation: He has also exhibited in Paris, Cologne, Alalst, Belgium, Lund and Munich and has participated in museum exhibitions around the world.[citation needed]  see the artists CV here for list of exhibitions : http://www.eyewithwings.net/nechvatal/bio/bio.htm

For your 2nd citation for his work being in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.[citation needed] see: http://www.msstate.edu/Fineart_Online/Backissues/Vol_15/faf_v15_n04/text/review03.html

For #3: Art historian Donald Kuspit has written in his essay The Matrix of Sensations that Nechvatal's digital painting demonstrates that """"there are more possibilities of freedom in digital art — that is, the """"mental elements"""" are """"free[r] to enter into various combinations"""" and thus to be manipulated — than in architecture, painting and sculpture.""""[citation needed]

see: http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit8-5-05.asp which is cited in the reference section

 For #4: Frank Popper states in his book From Technological to Virtual Art that Nechvatal's computer virus work is important to the history of art as it has advanced the use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, while defending and preserving the values of formal painting.[citation needed] see: Frank Popper From Technological to Virtual Art, MIT Press, pp. 120-123

This is also cited in the reference section

The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this.  Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications.  I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people.  So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex?  No, it is not.  So, why is it there?  Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails.  I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary.

""" or typology) of three potential interpretive references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.

Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc.

In Revelation, John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is """"Appolyon,"""" from the Greek root word """"apolumi."""" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon,"""" from the Hebrew root word """"'abad,"""" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction.""""

I've have, in the travels here on Wikipedia, stumbled across some accounts that had been banned, and in each case, the banning notice advise the banned of the lenght of time the ban would be in effect? If not improper, might I be told?

I edited a hidden note to clean it up and expand it in hopes it would then be better understood and accepted because, in the state it was in, it was jumbled and confusing (obviously, such things are IMO). Also, part of the message was put in a hidden note before the word in the principle article (“are”)  that was sought (by other before me) to be protected and to remain unchanged, and part of the hidden note’s message was put behind the word (“are”) in what is a separate hidden note, a factor I saw as being counter-productive, but concerning which I also had an idea in my mind as to why someone might want a word or two – but few words were best IMO  in the part before the word “are.”

Editor EscapeOrbit (the person I understand is claiming that he was threatened) now takes the position that that the hidden note that was edited was near perfect and doing a good job for the many weeks it had been there.EscapeOrbit, in his talk page comment of 14:42, 8 February 2010, wrote ’’”The facts are that this note has been on this article in one fashion or another for some while. . .I believe it is doing the job intended.”’’ http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Queen_(band)&diff;=next&oldid;=342616216  However, the same EscapeOrbit on January 20, 2010, on the talk page for Queen, said ‘’“The ‘were’/’are’ ‘’{please note: this is the same ‘are’ in the principal article mentioned in my paragraph above} ‘’in the lead  and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.”’’ Please see the full entry in context in the footnotes, where you can see EscapeOrbit is saying this in response to another reader’s encouragement to improve the article so it can be nominated as a Good Article candidate.”I've put in this article for a peer review so that we can analyze what we need to do to improve it. In the next few days I intend to nominate this article as a 'Good Article' candidate, however I feel ‘’’work still needs to be done.’’ I will be making ‘’’major improvements’’’ to the history segment of the article, I feel we also need to develop a Further Reading section and add a lot more citations throughout the article. ‘’’Any contributions, no matter how small, would be sincerely appreciated.’’’ Let's do Freddie proud and get this to Featured Article status. TheStig 
I fear you'll not get very far with a GA nomination while there is still near constant edit warring over whether Queen still exist or not. ‘’’The """"were""""/""""are"""" in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.’’’ Is there no where we can get a definite answer that can be cited on this? Escape Orbit   {emphasis added} or the page itself if you prefer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Queen_(band)#Nationality

The hidden message was, by EscapeOrbit’s own words, having no good effect. We had a written encouragement to improve the article so it could be submitted as a GA candidate (see footnotes). With my edit of 16:43, 7 February 2010,  I included this edit summary: ‘’“expand existing important note with new footnote, both to hopefully have it be more widely accepted, resulting in lesser need to keep reverting these same few words.’’http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen_(band)&diff;=342506929&oldid;=342389811 The “important note” I addressed in my edit summary is the hidden note concerning the “are.” The purpose, intent, and actual effect was an improvement in the hidden message.

EscapeOrbit’s reason for wanting the language he wants in the hidden note, in spite of the fact that it is not working at all to slow the daily changes to the words in the principle article that we actually both seek to have preserved, is that he personally identifies himself with the phraseology and is on a quest to be personally responsible for having (what are, in his opinion – and interestingly enough I don’t disagree here) British subject matters use British English. He writes about this phrasing, precious to him, that it is ‘’”It is similar to a note that ‘’’I frequently attach to British musical band's articles” ‘’’ ’’ {emphasis added}. He is overly invested in defending the phrasing that by his own statement is not have a positive effect. The problem is that he has posted “frequently” and so, like a beloved child, even though he says it’s not working, he isn’t about to have anyone change his baby.

My changes to the hidden message are those words in bold: “are DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO IS OR WERE. 'Are' is the correct UK ‘’’primary compulsory education reading level’’’",0

 I have a 1949 edition of the GE """"Manual of Electric Instruments: Construction and Operating Principles"""" which describes a 4-quadrant power factor meter of the polarized vane type - it works like a miniature synchronous motor, with a polyphase rotating field like a motor, energized with the phase voltages, and the rotor magnetized by one selected phase current; the angle of the rotor directly represents the angle between voltage and current.

The GE manual says to use a wattmeter and varmeter for any critical measurements, because a single-current-coil power factor meter produces meaningless results in an unbalanced system.   """,0

 In comedy 

Deleted the """"In Comedy"""" section: it adds nothing to an understanding of Jack Ruby, and distracts from the rest of the article. Any significant influence by Ruby upon comedy could be placed in the Popular Culture section; any Ruby-related jokes are gratuitous at best.   

 In the popular culture section: NOFX reference 

I don't think the reference to the NOFX song """"The Man I Killed"""" being about Jack Ruby is correct. From what I've read, and my interpretation of the song, it is about someone (perhaps Fat Mike the lead singer) killing a world leader (most likely George W. Bush). Unless a good reference can be found to support the claim I don't think it is appropriate to have this claim listed under the """"Popular Culture"""" section. I am going to remove it for the time being.  
 

 Nixon-Ruby connection  
A number of sources claim that there was some sort of connection between Jack Ruby and Richard Nixon (  ). Even if this is all conspiracy nonsense, it should be somehow addressed in this article so people looking for information on the connection can get the truth and won't continue on to some other less reliable source .  
(learn to spell...)

I've seen a physical piece of paper (which of course I couldn't yet scan) at the National Archives in the 70s. (My father was a good friend of E. Raymond Lewis, Librarian of the House of Representative IIRC, and I would hang out talking to whomever while they met.) Rubenstein had been subpeonaed by McCarthy's Subcommitee on Investigations; Nixon sent a note (which is what I saw) saying that Ruby had been working for him in a confidential capacity and it would be unacceptable to question him in public (I forget the exact wording); the subpoena was revoked. I think the paper might have been in the congressional record.

See WP:NOR, crank.   

 I've got a xerox copy of that document, and it has a zip code on the FBI letterhead.  That's a bit of a problem, since there were no zip codes when it was supposedly was written.  It's actually widely admitted to be a forgery.  John McAdams

 A case has been made for explaining the ZIP code  that the one-page xerox is really a composite of 2 different documents. The top (on FBI letterhead) is a half-page undated typed note (""""NOTE: Extra copy. Inclosure not verified by official report. Return to file. This is sensitive.""""), used as a transmittal sheet, stapled on top of full page underneath. Only the bottom half of the full sheet dated 1947 is seen.  If this is correct, the presence of the ZIP code on the letterhead need not affect the dating of the bottom half. See discussion here.  

First let me say I don't know how to add new sections on Wiki or Wiki Talk pages so I'm putting this here even though it's not related to Nixon; It's related to JFK's VP, Lyndon B. Johnson. I'm absolutely speechless after looking through this article that Johnson's name isn't mentioned, anywhere, considering he WAS Kennedy's running mate, and there's a very famous picture of Johnson smiling at a man off in the crowd who is winking back to Johnson as if they're sharing some secret joke *while Johnson has his hand on a bible and is being sworn in.* And I think it's a very possible motive for having JFK assassinated; he *would* and *did* advance to the presidency upon JFK's assassination.

Something else I found that I stumbled across using StumbleUpon.com was that (according to the articles i read, which were full of hotlinks to other information around the web) according to that author, all 4 presidents who'd been assassinated *were* assassinated because they opposed 'central' banking or 'artificial' banking (not sure what the proper term would be), that is, the fact that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned corporation which prints money for a fraction of the cost of the face values of what they print. Something to think about.

I'll go look through my stumbleupon history to see if I can find the article I'm talking about in the previous paragraph, but there are quotes by Lincoln and Kennedy talking about how they were against the 'Federal Reserve' for lack of a better term, I'm not sure what it was called historically, I doubt it was always call",0

"""== Forbes Magazine's """"Most Powerful"""" Ranking ==

There is an increasing number of Forbes Magazine references appearing in the leading paragraphs of biographical wiki pages.  The opening paragraphs of a wiki page should contain important details, not subjective trivia.  Forbes 'most powerful' ranking is merely one American magazine editor's perceived and unsupported opinion as to each well-known person's 'power'.  By rights it should not appear on any wiki page other than the Forbes magazine page or Forbes Magazine ranking page.
It appears the less powerful an important person or celebrity is, the more likely (s)he is to have a Forbes ranking on their wiki page.  Truly powerful people do not.  For example:
Barack Obama (President, USA) - No mention of Forbes ridiculous ranking on his page
Vladimir Putin (Prime Minister, Russia) - No mention of Forbes
Dmitry Medvedev (President, Russia) - No mention of Forbes
David Cameron (Prime Minister, United Kingdom) - No mention of Forbes
Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister, Israel) - No mention of Forbes
Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King, Saudi Arabia) - No mention of Forbes
Nicolas Sarkozy (President, France) - No mention of Forbes
Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader, Iran) - No mention of Forbes
Naoto Kan (Prime Minister, Japan) - No mention of Forbes
Ashfaq Parvez Kayani (Chief of Army Staff, Pakistan) - No mention of Forbes
So why do the Forbes rankings keep appearing all over wiki?  Is there a wiki rule to stop the magazine from obtaining free advertising at wiki's expense?
  
Sorry but what does this have to do with the main page? (Also while I have no opinion on whether Forbes ratings belong it hardly seems surprising that the less 'powerful' and important person or celebrity is, the more likely they are to have a Forbes rating. You don't need a Forbes rating to tell you Barack Obama is important. You just need to words, 'President of the United States'. The same with all the rest you mentioned.)   

Why do Forbes Magazine's unsubstantiated rankings garner support on wiki?  They are obviously fabricated.  Many are rubbish.  For example, Forbes rank Michelle Obama as the most powerful woman in the world.  Yet it is Barack who is the president, not Michelle.  As 'First Lady' Michelle has no power whatsoever.
How about the number 2 'ranked' woman?  It is an American food saleswoman (Irene Rosenfeld).  What complete baloney.  Number 3 is an American television host (Oprah Winfrey), and finally at number 4 is a woman with real power, the Chancellor of Germany (Angela Merkel).  Forbes incredibly has ranked an American grocer and an American television host above a head of government.
My question is, why does a supposedly factual encyclopaedia (wiki) rate worthy of mention the suppositions and meanderings of a magazine that specialises in listening to gossip rather than in researching facts?
  

So what does this have to do with the main page?
If you don't think the information belongs in articles the place to discuss that is on the talk page of the effected articles.  You could also be bold and remove it and explain why.  If another editor reverts you then you are into the bold, revert, discuss cycle and you know who to discuss it with.
The discussion does not belong here because it has nothing to do with the main page and that is what this page is for.   fan ~~ 
And if you do want discussion somewhere in a more centralised page, the big header has suggestions. Perhaps start at WP:VPP

"Need help 

Hi bro. I'm expecting some help from you. There's an edit warring going on by an user User:Shivamsetu on pages of Patna and Bihar. Earlier it was written Bihar is a north indian state but he changed it to east. I've some reliable source (like news clips from india's trusted media group like The hindu, India today, TOI for instance see

RM, in that interview he identifies himself with pantheism and names Baruch Spinoza as another Jewish pantheist. A quick look on Google Books shows that he is often claimed as an atheist, as Northern heard say 1 2 3 4 5. In one 1974 work, Ben-Gurion is called a 'freethinking deist [who] had profound reverence for the Bible' 6. I've not been able to confirm his pantheism anywhere else, but a quote from the man himself should be considered more reliable, even though this may only have been his opinion at the time of the interview (1970). According to source 5, he identified as an atheist during the 1960 census, so perhaps his views changed or were fluctuant. It seems that it's hard to label him as anything, although whatever he was, it looks like he wasn't a theist and rejected traditional religious views of Judaism.   23:20, 23 July 2015",0

 Two birds, one stone 
Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on """"Russia Today"""" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian """"specializing"""" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic """"myths"""" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.
   As for my """"principles"""", they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately. It's obviously simpler to delete undiscussed POV anonymous IP edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality. But whether you register or not, whether you choose to reveal yourself or not, any edit that portrays Dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the Russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally POV.
   Your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt. I'll be happy to oblige.

The version that you are attempting to revert to is unstable. Your Talmudic source might be correct but it does not have any relevance to the article. You are attempting to edit against consensus. If you continue to revert then I will report you for WP:3RR and edit-warring. Thank you.  

You've made three mistakes:
 
Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

A tag has been placed on Jeff tragedy, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).

 Prof Rachel Baskerville´s Capital Maintenance contribution 

Prof Baskerville,

You are not allowed on Wikipedia to qoute yourself. It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy.

I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. 

Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.

I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.

Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:

""""This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:
Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. 
So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. 

Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:
“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. 

Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing

-TABpayment of dividends to shareholders;
-TABreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;
-TABa company’s purchase of its own shares

and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court"""".
So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010). Available from SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1526846

I will still add my points of disagreement with Prof Baskervilles contribution.

Facts are often disputed.  What we actually tend to do here is provide sources POVs from all sides, and describe that as NPOV.

I note that the JCPS does quite a number of different things, so even if some of its reports were hasbara oriented, others clearly have nothing whatsoever to do with hasbara.

Hello
Hi Harebag!  Welcome!  When I saw the article on the Pigeon Force Police 
Department, I thought it was a joke.  It is real.  I also started a new article on Larry Buendorf.  He's a secret service agent that wrestled a presidential assassin to the ground.  Any suggestions for improvement, let me know.  As for your article, I suggest a little background.  Mention the city and state name.  Fix the link.  Good Luck on editing!  

Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD: Who's the chief? Any major history? Big crime solved? Any controversy or major lawsuit against it? When was it established? Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established (if so when?).  These are just tips.  Otherwise, there is a risk that someone will petition for the article's deletion because there is a board for that (thus destroying your hard work).  That's the reason that I wrote quite a bit about my new article first rather than just start out with a few sentences and add to it slowly.  I do plan to add more to my article, though.

Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under """"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing."""" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned.

More on guarnello
""""GUARNELLO (M/F). Both a kind of linen or cotton textile, and the feminine garment constructed from such a fabric.... The guarnello, rascia or saia is the standard form of dress for angels. It is worn by children as a simple, washable garment, and possibly also by pregnant women. There are also examples of guarnelli listed under items of male clothing."""" - Dress in Renaissance Italy, 1400-1500, by Jacqueline Herald, Humanities Press: NJ, 1981, quoted here

The coarse overdress for working women definition is from The World of Renaissance Florence by Francesco Adorno, Translated by W. Darwell, Giunti, 1999, ISBN 8809013492.
page 80

This site says:
A loose, sheer overdress (worn over a regular dress), was used at home and after birth - hence very few depictions of such garbs exist. Some has argued that it is not too unlike the sheer chemise like garbs Botticelli's """"Three graces"""" wears in his """"Primavera"""", but it can also be seen in his portrait of """"Smeralda Brandini"""" in London.

That may also be following Herald, which is listed as one of the sources.

The fabric is also translated as """"fustian"""" which would seem to be the coarser variety.

And here's the kicker: An article in the Globe and Mail (quoted with the crucial next line here) says
Mona Lisa had recently given birth to a baby, a team of Canadian and French scientists announced Tuesday, so her mysterious smile may have expressed the weary joy of a mother with a newborn. Using infrared technology that allowed them to see beneath a layer of varnish, the researchers found that Leonardo da Vinci's model had a gauzy layer over her dress they say was typically worn by pregnant women of the time, or mothers who had recently given birth. The filmy robe was called a guarnello.

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

Backing for some and perhaps even all of this is probably within Williams' text for How We Are and Mellor's for No Such Thing as Society. Do you have either of these?    """,0

 Employee Free Choice Act 

I made some edits to your additions to the United States House Committee on Education and Labor article and the main Employee Free Choice Act article. My chief concerns was the way the markup was described. The lead in that stated the full markup included """"numerous amendments proposed by Republican committee members that were rejected by the majority"""" could be interpreted as violating NPOV, even though it references factual statements. The press release it cites from committee Republicans is far from an objective opinion on the bills merits or the conduct of the markup. That being said, Republican objections to the bill and the way the markup was conducted are reasonable to include in the article. I have rewritten those sections, keeping the intent of what is being said in place while minimizing potential POV issues.

In addition, I fixed the link to the Congressional Record statement by Rep. Miller, as the temporary link from Thomas no longer works. I created a template {{USCongRec}} that provides permanent links to pages in the Congressional Record. Also, {{USBill}} is a useful template for creating permanent links to legislative text which avoids potential broken links on Thomas. """,0

"""::::::::: Use or indeed overuse of the words 'informer' or 'suspected informer' alone remains pejorative and inappropriate here. Angus's suggestion of """"suspected by the IRA of being an informer' is not unreasonable as it indicates that it is a concept or crime particular to that side of the dispute. 
Sarah argues, """"What they are commonly called is what we should reflect here. Any inhabitant of Ireland who assisted with information given to the British was an informer."""" She avoids my earlier point. 'Commonly' has to include, in Ireland, Protestants and Unionists (who were themselves British) and therefore the concept is not common currency unless you regard Protestants as people of no consequence at all in the matter. Can you inform yourself?
And was it in 'common' use in Ireland that you would call someone who had reported a rape or a stray cow an informer? 
Sarah's other point that """"Protestants who openly supported the Republic were never killed. So it wasn't a sectarian matter"""" is risible. As if you execute those who come across to your side? Anyway most Protestant Republicans became Catholics. 
The number of Protestants in Cork who were home rulers would have been tiny and the percentage who supported the separatists minute and can pretty well all be named like Miss Dorothy Stopford or Sam Maguire. 
I will go for Angus's phrasing in my next edit.

"""

 Russian Jewish immigrants """"seeking renewed contact with their Jewish heritage"""" 

 The influx of refugees, many of them seeking renewed contact with their Jewish heritage, has led to a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil. 

Although this sounds very nice, this is just wishfull-thinking and a lack of knowlegde of the reallity of the russian-jewish german immigration.

To further explain my point, I'll use a bit from the Germany Talk page:

..., that during the last years more Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel as they, usually Ashkenazies, feel much closer to Germany and the German language (Yiddish is a Germanic language) than to Israel. The Hebrew language is too much different from Yiddish and Israel is a Mideast nation in a conflictive area, so an increasing number of Ashkenazies prefer emigrating to Germany where they feel more integrated

These kind of comments and insights are simply not true, are totally away from reality and show a profound lack of knowledge of current german/jewish life.

Good and reputable sources on this matter are abundant. I would suggest that you first start by readind the """"Juedische Allgemeine"""" Germany's (internationally aclaimed) leading daily newspapers devoted to the jewish community. You'll find there lots of insights, analysis, studies, newsreports, and this will help you a lot to understand the reality of the Russian-Jewish post 90's emigration to Germany. Furthermore the german government policies, decisions and the impacto on german society have also been thouroughly  described, analysed and commentated on the main media press (Spiegel, etc) easly. 

more Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel or feel much closer to Germany

The reason number one for this preference is the exceptionally conditions (read money) that this german post-berlin-wall policy entitles them to. (much to the critic of the Israeli Governement)

Most of Russian who came, would never have left the ex Soviet Union, if it wasnt for this special german policy and the catastrophic collapse of pensions and social security in Russia. Not to Israel, not to anywhere. So it is incorrect to say """"preferred"""". They just grabbed the opportunity. They neither feel closer to Germany nor to Israel. They feel and will continue to feel close to Russia, were they have already spent 2 thirds of their lives.

 Israel is a Mideast nation in a conflictive area 

Most of the young, connected to Judaism, educated Russian Jews, have indeed by enlarge emigrated to Israel, Canada or the US. This started happening in the 1970s and peaked in the 90s
 

 feel much closer to... German language (Yiddish is a Germanic language) 
again this is nonsense, as the vast majority of these people have never spoke yiddish. They spoke Russian and are connected to the russian culture.

 """" ...a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil """" and Chabad Lubavitch 

 ... Chabad-Lubavitch ..opened this ...Chabad-Lubavitch ... ordained .that.. this and that 

Chabad-Lubavitch opens and ordains all over the world. From Beijing to Antartica. And indeed more and more in the recent years. What I simply cannot understand is how come a minority (and extremly active) stream in modern Judaism can be representative of the """".a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil"""".

The issue of the """"renaissance"""" with integration and participation of the """"russian jews"""" in the german jewish community, their clashes and success stories is a well documented (and problematic one). Again, read the german (jewish and non jewish ) newspapers.

In their vast majority they were already above 50 when they arrived in Germany, and I would not say that their connection with judaism was/is """"that big"""". Actually  because many of them are from mixed marriages, their offspring in Germany, no longer considers itself or has interest in their """"jewishness"""".  The cornerstone of they identity is Russia, not Judaism. Again, read the german sources.

Pathoschild, I could kiss you a thousand times. Thank you for for smoothing out the blocking issue, and, especially, for hearing me!

As to arbitration: well, it sounds nice in theory, but I worry the actual good it'd do and how I'd probably be the one to get smacked down. At the risk of sounding, er, slightly paranoid, my style apparently makes me a magnet for All Bad Things and there is not much I can do about it. It seems as if Dominick can do and say anything, repeatedly, and nothing happens, but I get admonished (or blocked!) for sarcasm and things I didn't even do. 

While I was blocked (which incident is forgiven): in the """"external links"""" section at the entry """"Rosary,"""" he replaced this link with this one, calling the former a """"monograph site"""" (by which he means, apparently, that there is one person who oversees thing  even though I have SIX people and he has been informed of this. If there's anything in the rules about monographs, I'd like to see what the heck Dominick is talking about). Malachias111 (my """"meatpuppet"""") had my back, but man, oh, man!

I just want for him to leave me ALONE, to quit libelling me and my life's work, and to stop taking down perfectly relevant, helpful, and informative links just because he hates traditional Catholicism. Dominick is a """"POV Warrior"""" with a a neo-conservative Catholic POV who engages in harrassment and a soft form of """"vandalism"""" (though I don't think his purpose is to imperil the integrity of the encyclopedia, he is removing perfectly good content for no good reason  and lying about that content in the process). If he wants to go through and put the line """"a traditional Catholic website"""" after any link to my site, then fine. But removing the links, replacing them (esp. with lesser quality links), lying about them (he says they're a """"blog,"""" """"POV,"""" """"monograph,"""" 'linkspam,"""" etc.), slandering me and the site in his edit summary notes, etc.  I can't just let him do that.

If you can give me decent odds that I will get a fair """"hearing,"""" if the abritrators will read my RfC and the associated discussion page, click on the links, and look into what I have been saying, then I would very much like to move forward; but, if the odds say it's going to be a matter of their looking at style over substance (e.g., seeing my admitted sarcasm after months of weirdness and not looking into the reasons for it), then , I dunno 'cause I can't take another """"Oh, great, he wins again!"""" type situation. 

I will try to be more civil as it is apparently defined, but if it weren't for sarcasm, I don't know how I'd survive this stuff. If you knew what I'd been tempted to say, you'd think I were Mother Theresa LOL 

In any case, I thank you for your attention. It's good to know I am not being totally ignored in all this and that someone out there is actually hearing me. No, it's beyond """"good""""; it is a RELIEF as this has been really upsetting and time-consuming for me. I appreciate your time and know it can't be any fun for you either; I make my own self sick repeating my defense over and over LOL. Wish I didn't have to. 

I saw earlier, though, that there are things going on in your """"real life"""" that were, at least, to take you away from administrating until after Christmas. I hope that, whatever those events may be, they are happy ones. Assuming the odds are decent and this goes forward at all, if bringing all this up to an arbitration committee is too time-consuming or distracting, it can wait 'til after Christmas when you have more time. Sounds as though you have stuff going on...  20:07""",0

There is no need to threaten - I feel that we have been able to disagree very amicably up till now and are working well to come to a resolution which meets wikipedia's policies and procedures. I'm not putting WP:OR into an article, nor am I doing any. (Okay, I suppose calling it an urban legend was my own term and is WP:OR, but I was doing that conversationally and would never dream of putting it in the article). I simply said that this fact, if included, had to have a WP:RS. I have presented about a dozen or so sources, none of which include this. You have found one source, which is far less reliable than any of the ones I have brought, which mentions it as something rarely done today. I'm simply asking that this fact be sourced properly and that that be reflected in the article - something which you seem to be open to as well. If we use the BBC source, then we should probably also mention that none of the three major rabbinic organizations include this rule. (Citing their rules which I included links to in my previous comment). To clarify I'm not suggesting we use use the phrase """"urban legend"""" in the article at all - I'm just saying that we need a better source than the original one and that the scope of the source be reflected.
Frankly I understand your somewhat visceral reaction. This idea is so pervasive that it has almost become a reality in and of itself in that perception frequently affects reality. I was taught that it was true, and took it as fact until recently when I had a conversation with a rabbi who does conversions for the RCA and helped draft their policies. Only afterwards did I start digging and realized it had no source. It is impossible to prove a negative so I can't prove to you that it doesn't exist """"somewhere"""". However I can insist that we use a WP:RS. If you can find a reliable Jewish source, either classical or contemporary, for this then by all means include it with that source, but so far none has been located.   
As a side note here's another article on Marc Angel's group's website which would probably count as a RS - it's not in the description there either.   """,0

 Bibliography Revamp with Serialisation 

I'm proposing a revamp of the Bibliography section including the addition of a second table dealing with the serialisations of the Hornblower novels.
The serialisations were actually the first publication of all the works except the first novel so I think they deserve the space.

Currently I've put my proposed new content up at User:Jaa101/sandbox.

With the main bibliography table the main change I'm proposing is to have separate columns for the US and UK titles which are so often different.
This frees up the comments column for other information.
I've also made both the dates of publication and dates of the stories more precise.

One worry I have with both my tables is that I've linked extensively and repeatedly in them.
Normally one would link only on the first occurrence but, in this case, the tables are sortable so what's first may change.
I think it's acceptable as it is.

Finally, I've added mention of the first and most important omnibus """"Captain Hornblower"""" and also the """"Cadet Editions"""".

I propose to change the main page based on feedback.

 Good job UC Bill. Thanks. I submit that all we need to settle out of this ArbCom is whether or not the previous RfC, where the community rejected “son of autoformatting”, was a fair and proper reading of the community consensus.

It appears that you are conceding that, while you back your code, you acknowledge that the community doesn’t want “son of autoformatting”. If that is the case, I think we are done here on ArbCom on that issue.Wikipedia is a hobby; we’re all volunteering our efforts. And I would dislike it a great deal if I worked on something that few Wikipedians wanted. If I were you, I’d solicit input on what exactly the community wants through RfCs of your own. I’d also drop posts on the talk pages of known opponents of “son of autoformatting” (like Tony, Dabomb87, Ohconfucious, and me) in order to get a clear understanding of what the community would really like to receive, and then go to work on that.

"The ECMA text that yo cite precisely confirms that this is the way Eiffel text should read. That text is in fact saying the same as the Wikipedia rules: semantics should not depend on color. On the other hand, color should be used to reinforce semantics, in a consistent way.

Until I and another person started working on the Eiffel article a few weeks ago it was a disgrace, full of inaccuracies and opinions, with almost no factual information on the language. Apparently that was not a reason to complain. Now that we are devoting our time to producing a good article with the same standards of quality as a scientific publication we are being heckled by people who only care about enforcing some font commonality.

"""I've heard it said that Charles Darwin did not want to publish his ideas because he felt it would hurt his wife, whom he loved.  She was not an evolutionist.

That could be part of the answer. At least, so much can be read in Darwin's original autobiography, which was first published in 1887, esp. in footnotes in the chapter about the development of his own religious convictions. Another reason (also clear from his ab) might be his frequent illnesses, and his zealous drive to publish as much as possible about other biological/zoological fields of research. He was always frustrated he could not do more.Fact is he produced an enormous amount of work!.
A third reason Darwin waited 19 years was that he simply was afraid of being 'prejudiced' (word quoted literally). His theory needed more time to ripen, so to speak. Anyway, maybe this is of some help. Anyone with more knowledge about it,please go ahead.

Imho the first sentence """"Contrary ..."""" should only appear later. One who does not know anything about Darwin reading this page should have a short introduction as first paragraph, not a negation of something assumed to """"be publicly known"""". (Yes, I am picky ;)

"A Complete Restart Not Necessary 

This article is on the right track, it it were just reorganized.   In general, other articles start with a background of the history of the term.  In this case, when did the designation of MIA begin.  The idea was used as long ago as the American Civil War, and surely the concept was known in the Napoleonic wars as many prisoners were taken.  However, it is also likely that the designation of MIA was a product of the expected survival or capture of opposition.  In Pre-Napoleonic times most wounded soldiers died, and many would be killed rather than taken prisoner.  I am not enough of an expert on this to say when the changes took place, but it surely has something to do with MIA as a designation.

I think that the Kerry issue is not germane at all to the overall topic, although may be worthy of exploration.  Mentioning Viet-Nam and Korea are not US centric, either, as Korea was a UN sponsored war, and many countries sent soldiers.  While less widely supported, British, Australian, and Korean soldiers were also present in South Viet-Nam, as were Chinese, and Soviet soldiers in the North.  However, there were many wars that were fought by countries other than the US that bear mentioning, especially those fought by Israel.

"Article Evaluation  

Article Evaluation 
For this assignment, I was tasked to analyze and comment on the article about Change Management. The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. 
The article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. 
The article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. 
Overall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.",0

Dear Dabomb87,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0

btw- I make notice of a map of balkanfevers page showing Greece largely occupied by """"Greater Macedonia"""". Under normal circumstances I would accept the argument that is just an example of various Balkan states dreams of empire (it also shows Greece overlapping FYROM). However, because of a combination of several factors I've fought the issue (along with the perceived admin bias)

1. Balkanfver has had a clear anti-Greek agenda for a long time.

2. US/UN resolutions that make it very plain... Greeks don't maps showing their country controlled by FYROM remote funny. I really don't care what the reasons are for drawing them. (something that certain admins are having problems grasping)

3. The creator of the map (something I doubt even Balkanfever knows)... is from FYROM. (I researched it but didn't mention it to anyone yet)

I don't fricken want to see any more maps coming out of FYROM sources showing Greece occupied. (If some neutral third party unrelated to FYROM does it... that's another matter.) I don't care the reasons and justifications. FYROM pushing this garbage is against US/UN resolutions and borders on an act of war.

 suggestions to improve readability 

Hi guys, the page seems very fragmented and is difficult to read, at least thats what I read in the 24 reader comments. (i inserted public ledger in the first sentence because it was missing). 

before delving into the supertechnical aspect of how bitcoins are generated and frustrate readers, i d start from the spot that everybody understands about money: explain the intent of the system (missing right now). sthg like:  """"it was created to exchange money electronically and securely without a third party, that can dictate credit worthiness or  price of transactions as in banks or PayPal etc.

then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description Ive read is: """"When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. Bitcoin miners scoop it up, verify it, and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation. Once the transaction has been confirmed, there is no way for that same person to spend those same bitcoins because they are being checked against the public ledger."""" by Morgen Peck in IEEE spectrum Feb 13, 14 

a short and successful article explaining bitcoins is here. 
another FAQ from a Washington Post blog is here

Thank you now if you and Elonka think my edits were biased or NPOV, then we can discuss your thoughts toward building consensus on that new, untagged topic. However, you have not listed bias or NPOV, you have listed two """"OR"""" statements. Well, what they really amount to is misplaced clauses. We could easily delete """"to solicit donors"""" and """"to assist Elder in the process"""" and move them elsewhere, or move the footnotes and add other footnotes. But isn't it interesting that if that had been Elonka's concern, she could have deleted just the clauses instead of the whole sentences? Have you read User:Kazvorpal#Truth, not silence?
Also, as I will point out at AFD, the simple facts are that this usage was created entirely by Paul supporters, it received prominence solely due to Paul supporters, and upon reaching prominence it has been used by six campaigns.

But most important, I thought third opinions were a form of mediation. I need you to answer questions (1) and (2) just above so that I know whether this process should continue or what other process I should invoke to build consensus. Elonka and I have seriously different intentions for this article, and that difference should be worked out by discussion. I have politely refused to encourage edit warring, to the article's detriment, and to fulfillment of my warning that Elonka's actions improperly encouraged AFD.

Archuleta also said he enjoys Broadway musicals.[23]

On his American Idol """"Fast Facts"""" page, Archuleta cited his musical influences as Natalie Cole, Stevie Wonder, Kirk Franklin and Bryan Adams.[18] When he listed his top pop music artists, he cited Natasha Bedingfield, Natalie Cole, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bryan Adams, Kirk Franklin, and Robbie Williams.[18] Like Elliott Yamin and another singer he admires, John Mayer, Archuleta tries to infuse his pop selections with a soulful vibe.[17] In a Seventeen interview he cites Sara Bareilles as a clever singer-songwriter he looks up to.[24]

MANILA, Philippines—Media people who attended the press conference of Idols David Cook and David Archuleta were given instructions not to ask three questions.

The off-limits topics included: (1) the recent death of Cook’s brother; (2) Archuleta’s fascination for local diva Regine Velasquez; and (3) rumors concerning Archuleta’s gender.

No one dared.

""":The source he is referring to is likely this: the article I discovered.  The reason I invited the wider view (mentioning that other political parties are involved in violence) is because it gives the reader a greater understanding of the elements at play.  Just as if one were to read about sea stars and there is a mention that they eat phytoplankton, mentioning that jellyfish also eat phytoplankton might be useful for greater understanding of the sea stars (are they in the same waters, do they compete for food).  To present this information as if CPI(M) members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties.  In another example, if we were to present a fistfight between a man in a red shirt and a man in a white shirt, when they both were arrested for fighting... If we reported that as """"The man in the red shirt was striking the man in the white shirt repeatedly until eventually he was arrested."""" is not neutral because it gives undue weight to only one portion of a greater conflict, not informing the reader of all the information they could otherwise have.

As to your other question.  """"What wiki policy prohibits use of only one source?"""" if the source is reliable for the type of information the source is providing here, then it may not be correct for it to be prohibited.  If other reliable sources disagree about the existence of Harmath, then we'd have a different avenue to go.  However, this is the Wikipedia policy I am currently the most concerned with.  If Harmath is truly only supported by a single source, mentioning them unequivocally as a militant arm of the party based on that one source might be undue weight.  Saying """"One source claimed that an organization called Harmath is a militant arm..."""" might be better, but we must take care not to use that as a gateway to simply reprint the article here.  If there is but one source, the weight that this should be given is likely minimal.  Does that properly speak to my viewpoints?  72.192.46.9

Yes, I'm sure it's possible that the many books and articles on the topic, written by various well-known authors, or found in reputable sources, are, in fact, completely wrong, but you'd have to find other reputable sources to refute them; your own personal concern with the concept is not particularly relevant.

 Not sure why we beat around the bush in not just saying she was crushed by a bulldozer 

All three of the first three sources cited about the cause of her death (the film Occupation 101, The Guardian, and Time) state that she was killed by a bulldozer, whether you want to call it an accident or not. Trying to reference which aspect of being bulldozed, such as """"debris"""" falling from the bulldozer, as the IDF reworded it, is a way of psychologically distancing the person operating the bulldozer for the IDF from having any direct responsibility for the action. None of the three sources state it was caused by """"debris."""" So the source citations should be moved closer to the statement that the witnesses said she was caught """"underneath."""" Currently the three citations have been placed next to a phrase that none of them reference. Therefore the sentence should be broken into two parts. The part about the IDF referencing """"debris"""" should have whatever citation mentions it next to that sentence, but none of the three sources cited references debris at all. 

Here is what they do say:

1. http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/occupation-101-full-movie-in-11-parts/  Part 6 of 7 after about 7:41, the film Occupation 101 (2006) states """"she got caught underneath the bulldozer""""; """"When Rachel Corrie was killed, she was protecting a doctor's home""""; """"The U.S. Congress has refused her parents' request for an independent investigation in her murder.""""  This source said nothing about debris accidentally falling on her. 

2. """"Corrie, 23, was crushed to death by an army bulldozer in Rafah, Gaza, as she protested against house demolitions."""" -The Guardian. This newspaper simply states she was """"crushed to death by the bulldozer.""""

3. """"Rachel Corrie was a 23-year-old American from Olympia, Wash., who was crushed to death by an Israeli Army bulldozer March 16, 2003. Corrie was in the Gaza Strip, working with the International Solidarity Movement, which opposes Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and living among Palestinians whose homes were being demolished. She was kneeling in front of a home, acting as a human shield, when she was bulldozed."""" - Time.     
Again, here we are told she was """"crushed to death"""" and """"bulldozed."""" Nothing about debris accidentally falling.

I or someone else should put the citations next to a phrase about the bulldozer killing her. How exactly it killed her (whether dropping stuff on her or rolling over her) is speculative. None of the three sources reference debris. If the IDF """"debris"""" statement must be included it should be a separate sentence. The IDF operated the machine and have a potential self protection conflict of interest in their wording.

I'd feel better if it said something like: 

""""She was crushed by a bulldozer's operations clearing land in front of a Palestinian doctor's home.[1,2,3] An IDF investigation reported she died after being struck by falling debris.[source??]""""

(More accurate for the IDF part of it would be """"by debris falling from the bulldozer."""" I'd probably rather it say the IDF """"claimed"""" rather than """"reported"""" but I'm not going to change that part.)

 Clerks 

Hi Mdann52. We have added you to the list of clerks and subscribed you to the mailing list (info: WP:AC/C#clerks-l). Welcome, and I look forward to working with you! To adjust your subscription options for the mailing list, see the link at mail:clerks-l. The mailing list works in the usual way, and the address to which new mailing list threads can be sent is . Useful reading for new clerks is the procedures page, WP:AC/C/P, but you will learn all the basic components of clerking on-the-job.

New clerks begin as a trainee, are listed as such at WP:AC/C#Personnel, and will remain so until they have learned all the aspects of the job. When you've finished training, which usually takes a couple of/a few months, then we'll propose to the Committee that you be made a full clerk. As a clerk, you'll need to check your e-mail regularly, as the mailing list is where the clerks co-ordinate (on-wiki co-ordination page also exists but is not used nearly as much). If you've any questions at any point of your traineeship, simply post to the mailing list.

Lastly, it might be useful if you enter your timezone into WP:AC/C#Personnel (in the same format as the other members have), so that we can estimate when we will have clerks available each day; this is, of course, at your discretion. Again, welcome! Regards,  | Parlez Moi 
Eh, I gave you the traditional greeting even if it doesn't all apply. Welcome to the office and grab a fez  | Parlez Moi """,0
"You all ignore the fact that the participants are mostly of those who have an ax to grind regarding userboxes, a self-selected audience. If I had wanted to stuff the ballot, I could have laid in hundreds of notes to polarized user groups from random ips, instead, I spoke to 40-or-so by hand of a fairly neutral group who were directly affected by this ridiculous proposal.  

Also, citing an arbcom ruling rather than policy shows how contrived this is.  Mindspillage asked me to reconsider, he said nothing about policy or blocking. How can you say inviting participants to a Wikipedia-wide issue is disruptive?  How can you say that I should somehow have known that? The real question is, why is this thing not on the main page? The answer is, because most would oppose it, but the anti-userbox admins think they know what is best, and are pulling every trick they can to cram this through.

If you want to design either a jury-pool process or a general election process to decide such things, I'll be happy to help you.

How is this a personal attack, except to note that the mass blanking happened and the perpetrator is documented?  Face it, the ban came only because what I said is unpopular with admins. MarkSweep made hundreds of blanking edits using admin tools, speciously twisted rules into knots and disrupted hundreds of users. He got a slap on the wrist, and polite applause.  I've received notes from admins on this page threatening me for suggesting that his actions constitute vandalism, which they clearly do.  I pass a note pointing this out to a small subset of the hundreds of users affected, I am banned for 31 hours.  How is this not political? Now I'm afraid to contact my own friends here, whom I know to be against this, but do not know about it.

Tacky? Pretending this proposal is put before a representative audience is tacky, as is the slash-and-burn approach taken in the first place, as is the attempts by MarkSweep to fit me with a gag until the end of UPP (that is REALLY tacky), as is the naked political calculation on my AN/I as to how this speaks for their pet proposal, and how it should be played.  The fact is that this proposal will never have community assent because of its deep flaws, and I am resented for pointing this out.  Tacky is pretending in the face of all evidence that there is a basis for consensus here.",0

""""Another non-military usage of the phrase is found in a one-man Pennsylvania """"minority report"""" published after the ratifying convention [cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs, with selected quotation from the """"minority report""""].""""

So with the turret facing forward, after the gun becomes completely vertical it can now swing to point literally backwards to form a 10º angle with the upper part of the rear of the vehicle?

 Havana City vs. Havana City Province 

The source of that confusion is that Havana City Province includes Havana and other cities like Marianao, Santiago de las Vegas, San Miguel del Padron, Regla, Guanabacoa and so on, with their own city halls, institutions, history, etc. Now, it is true that the history, the economy and the social lives of those cities have a strong bond with Havana. For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says """"I'm going to Havana to shop"""". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics. By the way, the population of Havana City Province of 2.2 million people, are from the last census of 2002. In ten years, the population have grown, for sure.

I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

Version 1.0 is moving along, and the Germans are almost ready to issue their printed, 50K-article, 1000-printed page Bertelsmann (Random House) encyclopedia, having been hard at work on the printed version since 2004.  Not getting a core of publishable articles on Wikipedia is simply not an option; it will be printed in some form or another, and as soon as it looks like someone else is beating us to it in this new wiki-world we've created, my guess is we'll get something out the door, if we have to hire content experts or translate the German printed encyclopedia to do it.

Dustin,

Alan Gamble here, from Metal Suppliers Online. This is day one for me in understanding how to add information to Wikipedia articles.

I'm spent my career in the field - 32 years in all, and in 1995 I created www.suppliersonline.com.

I personally researched and wrote every word of our property data pages and was interested in finding out how to share this data with Wikipedia in an open source manner.

Unfortunately, my first clumsy attempt was flagged by you. My apologies.

Here is a link to some of the property pages I've created:

Any thoughts on how best to share this?

"""

The problem, precisely, is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure [noun] is raining [object], then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless, i. e. a dummy word. If the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is, then by definition it's not a dummy pronoun. My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter. I know it's not completely wrong or misleading, though it probably needs a different form. The glossary definition above, OTOH, is a bit too vague, but in any case, note that the very first example of dummy word given below in the source is the it in It is raining.""",0

The effect the atmosphere has as far as where that energy ends up  scattered back into space, absorbed and reradiated in the upper atmosphere, trapped near the surface via a runaway greenhouse effect, etc.  is huuuuuuuge.

"As Roland perceptively noted, Sand's book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people.

In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book.

Thank you for absolutely confirming my opinion about your ability to construct sound positions based on actual facts.,0
"""::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

 Completion date

The new reference is now to the main page at http://burjdubaiskyscraper.com which does indeed say 30 June '09.  My question is: can burjdubaiskyscraper.com be considered a reliable source?

Since burjdubaiskyscraper.com is just a third-party site, I do not think they can be trusted with knowing the official information.  But, Emporis.com does have a completion date of 2009; they can be trusted.  Also, I do not know how anyone can know the exact date of the completion of a building.  It would be best to just stick to the year.   (talk | contributions) 

    

 Height in early March 2008 

Several editors have changed the height of the Burj Dubai from 604.9 m to 611.3 m.  I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

The Standard Note you quote is just Adam Mellows-Facer's opinion. I think I sent in several corrections to Standard Notes and Research Papers over the years then I just got bored with it. To take just one example, the SN refers to the 1935-1945 swing as being meaningless because """"National Labour candidates contributed 1.6% to the National total in 1935"""". True to say that but totally irrelevant: most voters in 1935 understood National Labour to be in effect Conservative, and it was only the Macdonald family which thought of it as being Labour. What the SN says when giving examples is no more definitive than a newspaper article and I absolutely refute that it is 'authoritative'.

The reason why swing is used for Conservative and Labour only and not for any other parties is that it doesn't work properly for others. The calculation is only any use if you can take the result and apply it elsewhere to compare and contrast, and that only works for Conservative and Labour in practice. Look at the distribution of the so-called """"Conservative - Liberal Democrat swing' and it's completely random.  | Talk """,0

Podczas składania kwiatów pod Pomnikiem Czynu Powstańczego uczynili oni gest pozdrowienia poprzez podniesienie prawej ręki. Geneza tego gestu sięga Cesarstwa Rzymskiego. Był to tzw. „rzymski salut” stosowany podczas powitania cesarza.

if that's the case, he'd better get busy deleting """"his"""" article! ROFL

i haven't the heart to participate in this article anymore, but would somebody please revert the POV at least oldwindybear inserted? i put in my time. surely there's a knowledgeable B&C; freak out there who can at least stand guard for a while, if not improve the article from even its pre-vandalism state.  

note to oldwindybear
before you insert your allegations once again (hopefully somewhere that doesn't break up my signed comment), you may want to consider some immutable truths which i hoped you would have noticed before launching the terribly wrong rant i just removed from within my signed comments. (unlike you, i do not want somebody else's words attributed to me):

the version i quoted above as """"wikipedia"""" in the comparison is entirely from 12:03, 20 June 2005 UTC.
you claim to have contributed to the article as  and .
the first edit by  in the article was 20:21, 5 September 2005 UTC.
the first edit by  in the article was 20:06, 4 September 2005 UTC.
therefore, you did not write a single word of the article version in the comparison above.

please take a moment to let that sink in: you did not write a single word of the article version in the comparison above.

you also misapprehend the definition of plagiarism. it has nothing to do with copyright. you used entire blocks of words of other authors (primarily me), and credited yourself as the author. that is plagiarism.

though my initial contributions to the article are readily viewable in the history (and later as another user and several IPs), i want to steer away from the """"i wrote x amount"""" aspect, because the article was and is a collaborative effort. the troubling part, not only for me, but also for the owner of the site to which you submitted """"your"""" article, is that you used whole blocks from a wikipedia article to which you contributed not a single word, and not only put your name to it, but did not even cite wikipedia as a source.

contrary to the fraudulent hiding of your sources while merely peppering whole blocks of material you stole, i did write the actual unquoted prose in my contributions myself, while citing clearly all of my sources. despite your assertion, the version you stole from stated explicitly, """"Known primarily for robbing banks, he preferred smaller jobs, robbing grocery stores and filling stations at a rate far outpacing the ten to fifteen bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow gang."""" as with everything else in the wikipedia side of the comparison, none of that is your writing. neither, as has been raised and explained several times already, were you the first in this article to raise the issue of legality with regard to the killing of bonnie parker. this has all been explained. please do not bully other users into holding your hand. take a moment. review the article history. review the discussion. slow down and pay attention.

in short, there isn't a leg to stand on if attempting to rebut my charge of plagiarism. you did not arrive on the scene until over 2 months had passed from when the version in the comparison was written. i'll say again: you did not contribute a single syllable to it. yet you lifted whole sections from it, changing very little — in some cases none — and put your name to it. that, sir, is the very definition of plagiarism, and it doesn't matter whether i or any other editor wrote the source material you took; you wrote none of it. the partial copying at the beginning (which you picked out to rebut) was what i already labeled as only """"minor lifting"""". be honest. it gets far worse. it gets embarrassingly worse. please don't try to fabricate stories which anybody poring through the history can instantly recognize as vapor. the sad part is that the entire facade of """"your article"""" was as an excuse for you to insert even more POV into articles. if you don't understand WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, etc. after so many people have tried explaining them to you, perhaps wikipedia isn't the plac",0

 Cultural depictions of George Byron, 6th Baron Byron 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.

 1. SilentResident: """"Everyone knows that the 1st phase (July74) of the Turkish Army's intervention in Cyprus was apparently legal. None disputes that.""""
 AF: OK. Even there are many fanatics that do not see:
 The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) (29.07.1974, Resolution 573) """"The Turkish military intervention was the exercise of a RIGHT EMANATING FROM AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY and the FULLFILMENT OF A LEGAL and moral OBLIGATION.

 2. SilentResident: """"The 2nd invasion (August74) was an illegal......Greece, especially after the 2nd Invasion, deemed the entire operation Attila to be ILLEGAL.""""
 AF: Greece’s Athens Court of Appeals (21.03.1979; Case No: 2658/79): """"The Turkish military INTERVENTION in Cyprus, which was carried out in accordance with the Zurich and London Accords, was LEGAL. Turkey, as one of the Guarantor Powers, had the right lo fulfill her obligations. The real culprits . . . are the Greek officers who engineered and staged a coup and prepared the conditions for this INTERVENTION"""".
 Just after 5 years later than 1974, in 1979, Greece's Highest Court decided Turkish military intervention is legal without making any difference between 1st and 2nd military operation!

 3. SilentResident: """"The 2nd invasion didn't aim for the restoration of any law and order, because law and order in Cyprus has already been restored after the 1st invasion."""" 
 AF: The Rule of Law already ended in 1963 when NEUTRAL (German) (highest) judge of Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC) was forced to go out of Cyprus by Greek Cypriots, and SCCC ceased.
 Since, according to RoC constitution, Cyprus can only be represented by the participation of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, and there were no Turkish Cypriot in RoC government since 1963, Parliamentary Assembly of European Council stopped representation of Cyprus in PACE and expelled all Greek Cypriot representators. There was no representation of RoC during 1965-1986!
 When you say """"law and order in Cyprus has already been restored after the 1st invasion"""", you refer to """"the law and order in Cyprus that was forcefully existed by Greek Cypriots via expelling Turkish Cypriots, and via administrating Cyprus as the sole representator since 1963"""". 
 """"The law and order in Cyprus that was forcefully existed by Greek Cypriots via expelling Turkish Cypriots, and via administrating Cyprus as the sole representator since 1963"""" was not the law and order in Cyprus according to RoC's 1960 constitution.  Hence, """"1960 RoC's law and order"""" was not in execution and in place after 1st Turkish military operation. Green Line that was drawn by Britishes in 1963 was not in its place and damaged in favor of Greek Cypriots even after the 1st Turkish military operation. Only in the Turkish 2nd military operation, Turkey reached to the original Green Line drawn by Britishes in 1963. 

 4. SilentResident: Turkey does not have the right to: 
a) permanently keep its military on the island's territory even without permission from the local Cypriot authorities, even after the operations were successful and peace was restored on the island,
 AF: a) Turkey had/has the right of permanently keep 600 soldiers in Cyprus forever according to RoC 1960 constitution!
 b) eviction of all Greek Cypriots, Armenians and Jews from their homes forever and settlement of Anatolian settlers to the island
 AF: b) Completely very big lie of Greek Cypriots:
 After the hostilities in 1974, population transfers were made in accordance with the population exchange agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots (Third Vienna Agreement) under the auspices of United Nations on 2 August 1975;United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 02.08.1975 United Nations, Cyprus Population Exchange Agreement 2 August 1975. the Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada and Catholic Maronite Cypriots in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis agreed to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and stayed in the north and Turkish Cypriots in Limassol agreed to live under Greek Cypriot administration and stayed in the south of the Cyprus island.

"""* OK, where are we?  
(1) I have presented sourced evidence from official government websites (mostly Foreign Ministries or equivalent) that according to the governments of the UK, France and Italy, the EU is a member. 
(2) I have prsented sourced evidence from individual G8 websites, created by respective governments, that the EU is a member.  Nowhere is there any official statement that the EU is not a member. Some people are arguing that when it says the EU joined the G8, the word join has some special meaning (and they must therefore accept that Canada is not a member becasue I have shown the sentence where it says that both Canada and the EU 'joined'). 
(3) I have pointed out that most of the official G8 websites are quoting from the same source, so the contentious phrasing recure. 
(4) Lucy-marie quotes the sentence """"The European Union is represented at the G8 by the president of the European Commission and by the leader of the country that holds the EU presidency."""" Of course it is. This sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their Head of State/Government and is needed simply because the EU does not have a Head of State/Government. It doesn't mean anything else. 
(5) Lucy-marie further quotes """"The EU does not take part in G8 political discussions"""". Of course it doesn't: it would be quite wrong for the President of the Commission to do this since the EU cannot have a single view on these issues, being an association of many countries (some of which are represented in the G8 anyway). 
(6) Nowhere is there a source saying that the EU is not a member. I know, you can't prove a negative, but more significantly THERE IS NO SOURCE to say that the EU has partial membership, or restricted access, or observer status or anything other than full membership.

"The solution without a reference 

  //  Y1+
  //  =/=N0      
 M1

N0 never produces an output. The algorithm always produces a “M1” result when the answer is “Yes” from the oracle queried, and never produces a result when the answer is “N0” even to the other possible phrasings of the same query. It is striking how easy it is to miss the ingenuity of our programmers here. Most of the solution was already present as much as the pioneers and experts in the field surmised and asserted possible. Particularly, the comment on Fermat’s Last Theorem is relevantly applicable, such deep theories are in many instances required to solve largely thought unsolvable problems, especially in cases when most of the solution and the proof in the word was already known to the experts in the field.

The algorithm answers “Yes” with “M1” when the output produced from a correctly asked question produces never a “No” (written as N0) result, but only a “Yes” result. Incorrectly stated questions are they that cannot be resolved because they result in a “N” or “No” output never producing m by the computer given an incorrectly asked question. Given a correctly asked question, the computer will always return a “M” output eventually. But given the complexity of the question and the known variables the time required to solve an NP-Complete problem depends entirely on the specific incidence and construction of this algorithm. To illustrate the functions here is a clear example:

Question correctly asked: “Does the remote control not need new batteries?”

ALGORITHM says check the button function, if it changes the channel on the TV or the volume of the TV the computer monitoring the remote control produces a “M” result. The conclusion is output: Yes means no.

Incorrectly asked question seeking an NP-Complete problem: “Does the remote control have new batteries?” 

If the check of the remote control does reveal a failure of the button to change the channel or volume of the TV the answer is the conclusion is never output because this would be a “No” or “N” response.50.20.186.81  I Jesus, leave it as a proof to all life.

External Memory
I believe that the External Memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. One on """"Self Identity"""" and using external objects to identify one's self, and """"External Memory"""" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.

Self Identity:
In """"Stand Alone Complex"""" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch """"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?""""

This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these """"external mnemonic devices"""" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.

External Memory:
External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored """"offline"""" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.

Shiotani Teiko. And dozens and dozens more just like it.

Hi. You created an article saying, in full: Shiotani Teiko (塩谷定好? しおたに ていこう, 1899 - 1988) was a renowned Japanese photographer.

Actually it's Teikō, not Teiko, and according to WP's silly rules we have to ignore his real name of Shiotani Teikō and instead call him Teikō Shiotani. But that's not the main problem, which is that he's described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi (栗林慧? くりばやし さとし, born 1939) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo (渡辺兼人? わたなべ かねんど, born 1947) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or Orihara Kei (折原恵? おりはら けい, born 1948) is a renowned Japanese photographer. And so on and so on and so on. Which all means that somebody looking among Category:Japanese photographers is highly likely to land on a mere substub.

I can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles. No, on my thumbs: User:Pinkville and myself. But he's busy and I am too. I'd rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than stubs at well under 1%. It's an interesting """"proof of bot concept"""" exercise, but is it good for anything else? 

Tell you what: I'll match you one for one. You turn two of these into articles; I'll turn two into articles. You turn ten into articles; I'll turn ten into articles. How does that sound?   

That's a great challenge! You're on. –  (talk) (random) 

OK then. Do tell me when you've done one, as I can't keep the whole damn lot on my watchlist. Well actually I can, but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist. Also, I'll be intercoursingly busy during the next month, so in the short/medium term I may only be able to match you up to ten.

I'm sure I've got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people, so I ought to be able to do more.

What's odd about the list are some conspicuous absences. (Not just people I think are good, but people who, rightly or wrongly, are celebrated and successful.) Asai Shinpei is one, and there are more though I can't think of them right now. 

Not that it's any of my business, really, but did you scarf the list from User:20th Century Art (Zenhan)'s page, or do something else?   

Yeah, I scraped from Zenhan. I'll let you know here, or on your talk page, when I have one ready. I don't think I can make any of them featured, but legitimately """"non-stub"""" is the goal. All the best, –  (talk) (random) 

Okay, here's my first. Ichiki Shiro. It's not much beyond a stub, but it's something. (It took an hour of research, and I think I found all the info that's anywhere on the web regarding Mr. Ichiki.) By the way, was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto? My sources say he was a retainer of the Daimyo (in the Edo period, of course), and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo, so he couldn't have been a Gokenin. But I don't think he was a warrior, so I don't know. So far as I can tell, all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto. Am I correct in my inference? –  (talk) (random) 

Damn you're fast. 

Unfortunately I don't know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like. On several occasions I've tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat. I suppose I can't separate it from the hammily acted, cheesily lit TV period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the in-laws'. LordAmeth might know. (And this photographer's right up Pinkville's street.)   

How's this for a progress indicator?   
Great! –  (talk) (random) 
Yup, except for a number of factors, one of which is that it's problematical copyrightwise (or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one User:Quadell). I've already chucked in one extra list, and I'll certainly add one more, and I may add one after that; perhaps it can then be described as an original creation. All this is delaying my editing of any article. Still, I'll get around to that too in time.

Yeah well, I've corrected the paragraph twice and if you want me to do it a third time you need to pay me. Stating that people with albinism also can have nearsightedness and farsightedness is like saying people with pneumonia can also have a clubbed foot. When you list signs and symptoms of a disease, you limit them to the ones that are caused by or associated with the specific disease. Astigmatism is on the cornea, more rarely in the internal lens, and is an error of refraction. It has absolutely nothing to do with the pigment in the retinas. Albinism is a lack of pigment, the cornea doesn't need pigment to develop properly. The fovea, however, needs a normal RPE to develop properly. It isn't actually known why, but we do know this to be the case. In order to save myself time looking each fact up, I will just cite the most encyclopedic text and I'm sure every one of these points is there. However, you can't just point to one sentence and say """"here it is"""" you actually have to study the entire book to get an understanding of all this information. For example, you are never going to find one sentence in any text that states specifically that """"albinos have the same prevalence of nearsightedness as the regular population."""" No text would ever say that. They would say in one spot what albinism is, and in another spot say what nearsightedness was, and leave it up to the reader to understand the two have nothing to do with each other. Otherwise they would have to say in the description of each disease all the other thousands of diseases that have nothing to do with it. Would I look up pneumonia and find a specific sentence, """"pneumonia has nothing to do with clubbed foot."""" It seems to me that the original writer needs to cite a reference that albinism is associated with refractive errors, and if not, it just needs to be deleted. I can't cite a reference for a null, I can't cite a reference for someting I deleted. Do I just leave a blank line and cite why it's not there?

Answer to  
i) """"your arguments are very biased and unethical."""". You took sentences that suit you from different documents to make a point without revealing the conclusion/true intentions of the author in your sources.
ANSWER: I directly wrote what is written in the resolutions and books. The title of the heading """"The LEGAL ASPECTS of Turkey's 1974 Action """" cannot prevent you put the resolutions/sources that indicate the operation as illegal.

ii) Why didn't you write the whole thing?

The views of the member states of a particular organization (here: PACE) does not bind the organization itself unless there is a resolution is made in that organization.

What is binding in UN is the UN SC as you may know. And, once again, I am backing my writing: """"There is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as """"invasion"""". If you claim otherwise, just put a resolution no/date so that we are all behind you at this point. Here is the whole UN SC resolutions: UN Resolutions. Which one of them calls the intervention as INVASION? No one! 

iv) Kareklas concludes: """"Nevertheless, having regard to the EQUALLY POWERFUL ARGUEMENTS militating against unilateral armed INTERVENTION envisaged by treaty, it may be clearly concluded that Turkey SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION in Cyprus, 1974; however, such a proposition could remain subject to criticism, in view of the peculiarities of the Cyprus issue"""" 
ANS: Even the Greek Kareklas uses the word """"INTERVENTION"""" as you see. Dear , """"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION"""" even demonstrates the legality of the intervention (the fact I empasized about the legality of operation in that aspect). """"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION"""" means that """"THERE IS A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION"""" but """"IT WOULD BE NICE IF THAT RIGHT WAS NOT USED AND THE ISSUE WAS SOLVED BY OTHER MEANS"""". , if you do not understand in this way, you should develop your English.

v) In 1979, JUST AFTER 5 YEARS LATER THE OPERATION, The GREECE's Athens Court of Appeals: """"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL."""" Here, GREECE's court did not distinguish between the 1st phase (20-22July1974) and 2nd phase (14-16August1974) of the operation. In 1979, both of the first and second operation already finished 5 years ago. GREECE's court, hence, thought legal situation of both of the operations, in advance of making any decision about the 1974 war. , in the sentence """"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL."""", do you find any separation about both phase of the operations? 

vi) So... dear , as you see, I did not take the specific parts of the sources in part. The title """"The Legal Aspects of Turkey's 1974 Action"""" does not prevent you to find and write illegal aspects of the operation as well. You are welcome to state this. As long as these are not the parts of the interested parties, you can be sure that the sources you will find will be welcome. As you see, I directly write the text of PACE's resolution. PACE is not one of the two parties. I directly write the text of the decision of the GREECE's court. Here, GREECE's court certainly is a party, but indicates opinion/decision just opposite to GREECE's government.  That is, you should show sources i) not a party (neutral source) ii) one of the parties but express opposite view to the party (in which it is located) itself.  """,0

I am confused here.  I posted something about both of the publically funded Waldorf schools in Sonoma County, not an 'individual school,' and that information comes from official sources (so it is properly sourced), and the information provides information which contradicts the 'Official' Waldorf position.  I do not believe that the 'official' statement of the Waldorf committee reflects their reality.  Anti-immunization is so highly correlated with the Waldorf schools I have looked at as to be close to official policy.  Waldorf schools in the US  education as practiced in the US includes a substantial anti-immunization    

 Concerns over immunizations 

The current text refers to a 'consensus statement' which is a dead link.  This page http://www.waldorfanswers.org/QuestionsMore.htm refers to a growing anti-immunization movement within and outside of Waldorf schools, but again refers to the same dead link as the 'consensus statement' on vaccinations.

The article does not cite a verifiable source on the policy of Waldorf education towards vaccinations.  The article does say """"Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an """"anthroposophic lifestyle"""" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination""""  Which is a deep violation of NPOV - to assert a correlation when there is a deep selection bias in the cited studies.

The wording also seemed apologetic which Muslim scholars would never have been regarding the actions of the prophet, they would have accepted it and used it to legislate if they deemed the source reliable.

I see you reverted my adjustment to the Stephen Barrett criticism of the Institute of Noetic Sciences.  I believe you acted in good faith.  I also believe the revert was erroneous.

Barrett's list is published information.  Counting the number of organizations on the list does not represent original research.  It is simply a way of summarizing the context in which Barrett's criticism occurred.  It is information that is directly and explicitly supported by the source.  It is a routine calculation that most people over the age of six could perform for themselves.

As the article stands now, it is misleading and unbalanced.  A casual reader gets the impression that Barrett targeted the IONS out for special and specific criticism, when in fact his criticism was spread over hundreds of organizations.

 Polyspermy 

Before you revert the stable version - please discuss this first on the talk page. As for your question:
Look at the beginning of the third line. The Talmud quotes the verse from 1 Samuel 17, 4, which goes as follows: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines"""", right? Now, look at your Bible - ibid., and see the full verse: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath..."""". Right?
So, the Talmud quotes the verse about Goliath, and then: interprates this verse - using a pun - in the following way (see the Talmud ibid. in that third line): """"One hundred foreskins of Philistines - got her [i.e. his mother] pregnant"""". In other words: the Talmud explains, that the biblical words """"And there went out a champion"""" - mean:  """"And there was created/born a champion"""", and it also explains that the biblical words: """"out of the camp of the Philistines"""", mean: """"out of a hundred foreskins of Philistines"""". Note that this fantastic interpretaion made by the Talmud - is based on a pun: the word for """"camp"""" is similar to (i.e. sounds like) """"a hundred foreskins"""" (not in English of course). Note also that fantastic interpretaions for the Bible - are very common in the Talmud.
Now, look ibid. at the next line (i.e. the fourth line); The Talmud now explains how - having so many fathers - is really possible from a biological point of view, so the Talmud continues: """"Rav Matania said: no controversy over that; as long as the sperm [of the first man] hasn't gotten rotten [in the woman's body] yet, a woman can get pregnant by two men - all at once"""".
Notice that all of the Talmud's commentators explain all of this - as I did.
Hope this helps. Anyway, next time, please consult pefore you revert the stable version.

"I want to share something with you 

Here is a poem that details something I think you'll find educational.  After checking over your behavior on Wikipedia a little bit, I think you might be interested in what it's like to have a penis.  Your incessant edit warring (that you childishly deny), and your infuriating, relentless self-importance are all the evidence that I need to conclude that you either a) don't have a penis (much like Gwen Gale) or b) possess such a small penis that it just doesn't count.  Anyway, enjoy this poem - just for you.

I'll tell you a short poem; I'll try to make it quick. The subject is quite simple: The joy of having a dick.

Penises are super things; Daedalus969 should be jealous. An organ surrounded by sensitive skin. That's smooth and rarely hairless

It starts to grow dramatically, When you're about thirteen. Your testicles on either side; Your willy in between.

It dangles neatly down below; Soft, obedient and loyal. At the slightest hint of lust, It's ready to uncoil.

It often has a mind all of its own; It's like a wild untamed beast. It squirms and writhes and stretches out; When you expect it least.

Sometimes, yes, it misbehaves; Erecting when it shouldn't. A bumpy train ride sets it off; Just when you wish it wouldn't.

And during the summer, wearing little, sunning on the beach. The slightest sight of shaking boobs Makes it squirm just like a leech.

Handle it with love and care; For it can give great pleasure. Has it grown since last weekend? And when did you last measure?

Some people fret about its size; They give it lots of thought. Is thirteen inches long enough? It makes guys quite distraught.

They peek across in urinals, To compare and try to see But if another glances back at them. There's no way they can pee.

Masturbating is a sin; That's what some folk believe. But those are just old wives' tales; Cuz it really can relieve.

Without this fabulous organ, No shag would be complete. Lesbians will try their best; But must admit defeat.

It has to main bodily functions I'm sure you'll all agree. To start a whole new life and of course daily to pee

But I think the thing that's marvellous; About that one eyed brute. Is that when its trying to procreate, It knows which fluid to shoot

And always it remains with you; Until you're old and frail. Don't take it out in public though, or you'll be thrown in jail.

And so to summarise I'd say with certainty, that every male loves his little friend But girls, no matter what we do, Please don't fold, spindle mutilate and NEVER NEVER Bend!!!",0

 Locations 
Thailand.
While Phuket is a more popular and well known general tourist location in Thailand that includes sex tourism.  Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more """"sex for money"""" going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase """"sex tourism"""" as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  
Note that """"bar girls"""" in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves """"rented wifes"""" albeit for """"short time"""" rather then """"long time"""".  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the """"long-term"""" married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the """"wifes"""" direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and """"everybody pays for it"""". 
[Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as """"sex tourism"""" carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call """"Giesha cultures"""": e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus """"Virgin cultures"""" typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal. Exploitation of the child aside their is vastly more """"exploitation"""" going on outside of the sex busniess in the third world under global capitalism like Chinese factories where labourers - girls included - work excruciating long hours for a few Yuan or RMB.]

 Taking this to your own talk page as you don't seem quite as keen on listening to what I've got to say over on my page as you are hellbent on defiling everyone's edits for your enjoyment 

Alright, I've just had it up to here with you and your blasphemous claims of everyone's edits being """"unreferenced crap"""" because you're the only one who can't remain content of having others contribute to the site. I can put up with your labels of every edit you find disastisfactory to your bigoted tastes as """"vandalism,"""" but going through everyone's freaking contributions list to make it some White Man's Burden to undo every small trimmings of blatantly incorrect or dingy information is just pushing the line, so I suggest you don't break the 3-edit rule yourself if you're so pompously insisting the rules and law enforcements here are on your side.

Let's see back where this started in the Freeza section, for example. Like I said on my edits page, I haven't familiarized myself with making those neat little references at the bottom to add to my edits, so in straight, bold text as clear as day, I posted the chapter number where the psychic ability itself was displayed, and could well post an image to back up my claims, while each and every one of the rest of the information I posted was seen throughout his extended fight sequences with Goku and co., you can bet your money on it; it's not Berserk or Blade of the Immortal we're talking about here, but plain-out, simple everyday Dragonball, which everyone (save you) would be fully capable of seeing. 

Then, the Vegeta article? Please, Vegeta himself professed about the 17 million zenos required to initiate his Ozaru transformation which can only be produced by a full moon or his power ball that mixes with the planet's oxygen to create a replacement, which both he and Gohan used to transform, and after his tail was sliced off by Yajirobe, he fled to the Freeza Planet and stated that his tail would grow back after he came out of the healing tank with the tail stump in plain view. None of this is uncited information by any means, and you're well striking a chord with everyone's anger by hellbenting on removing all that on the crappy pretense that because you can't deal with someone else making contributions, you're right in labeling them """"unreferenced crap"""" or """"vandal"""" and digging through everyone's records like a 40-year old wanker to annul every effort.

And again, the Piccolo article? I simply added that Nail was the one he first fused with to gain his """"massive increase"""" and that he was the one who kicked Freeza away to help buy time for Goku's Genki Dama to charge, and I myself removed some so-called """"crap"""" information like """"Piccolo's bukujutsu being a different technique"""" when the Japanese manga simply states that his technique is a superior kind. What little others there were (my contributions, I mean) are simple, medial additions like """"scientist Gero"""" added to the unclear information that simply said """"Red Ribbon"""" at first, when it was just the one guy and nobody else that was working for vengeance. 

And finally, I've been on this site since back in 2005 or 6 or so since I was 14 and fully know my rules and qualifications, and haven't been blocked once, so I'd suggest that you take it to my profile if you've got such a beef with my edits that you need to act like a petulant, 4-year old child who wants his toy back destroying everyone's contributions on your whim when you yourself are no authority.

 Adding unreferenced entries of former employees to lists containing BLP material 

Hello, Please do not add unreferenced names as entries to the list of former employees in articles. Including this type of material in articles does not abide by current consensus and its inclusion is strongly discouraged in our policies and guidelines. The rationales are as follows:

WP:NOT tells us, Wikipedia is """"not an indiscriminate collection of information.""""  As that section describes, just because something is true, doesn't necessarily mean the info belongs in Wikipedia.  
As per WP:V, we cannot include information in Wikipedia that is not verifiable and sourced. 
 WP:Source list tells us that lists included within articles (including people's names) are subject to the same need for references as any other information in the article. 
Per WP:BLP, we have to be especially careful about including un-sourced info about living persons.

If you look at articles about companies in general, you will not find mention of previous employees, except in those cases where the employee was particularly notable.  Even then, the information is not presented just as a list of names, but is incorporated into the text itself (for example, when a company's article talks about the policies a previous CEO had, or when they mention the discovery/invention of a former engineer/researcher). If a preexisting article is already in the encyclopedia for the person you want to add to a list, it's generally regarded as sufficient to support their inclusion in list material in another article. cheers   """,0

I'd hardly say this is blind.... after all the article has suffered extensively since June 5th. Going through the phrasing of everything now could take a good editor of an encyclopedia days, and we'll be fighting against other edits. Look at the following:

Revere had reason to believe the patrol's mission was to arrest the two Patriot leaders. He and other captives taken by the patrol were still escorted east toward Lexington, until about a half mile from Lexington they heard a gunshot. The British major demanded Revere explain the gunfire, and Revere replied it was a signal to """"alarm the country"""". A few minutes later, came a flurry of gunfire that seemed to alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in.""""

All of that is based on a single book, takes up a significant portion of the article, and itself the source hasn't been verified to be objective. The style its written in suggests to me it may also be lifted word for word from the book, and to me at least seems to break NPOV. And that last line, """"alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in"""" takes a whole lot of liberties, nevermind certainly not being encyclopedic.
@ JeffJonez: I'm proposing a revision from 4 days ago, not a week. And much of what remains in the article from since the June 5th edits began is hardly verifiable or objective, and certainly doesn't maintain a neutral tone to the article.

The article says 

""""Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has observed Kanzi in communication to his sister. In this experiment, Kanzi was kept in a separate room of the Great Ape Project and shown some yogurt. Kanzi started vocalizing the word """"yogurt"""" in an unknown """"language""""; his sister, who could not see the yogurt, then pointed to the lexigram for yogurt.[5] """".

Now in this case, TG, there is a clear misrepresentation of the source, which reads 

""""In one experiment she described to me, she placed Kanzi and Panbanisha, his sister, in separate rooms where they could hear but not see each other. Through lexigrams, Savage-Rumbaugh explained to Kanzi that he would be given yogurt. He was then asked to communicate this information to Panbanisha.""""Kanzi vocalized, then Panbanisha vocalized in return and selected ‘yogurt’ on the keyboard in front of her,""""Savage-Rumbaugh tells me.""""

These accounts are substantially different, as you can see. 

In the source, S-R explains to Kanzi. through lexigrams, that he 'would be given' yogurt - in the article, he is 'shown' the yogurt.

In the source, Kanzi is asked to tell Panbanisha that he would be given yogurt, in the article he isn't.

In the source, Kanzi simply vocalizes; in the article, he vocalizes in an """"unknown 'language'"""".

Why is the wiki article simplified in this way ? Because the claims in the source are incredible. As far as I know, lexigrams do not include words such as 'would', so S-R can't tell Kanzi that he 'would' be given yogurt. Secondly, Kanzi is supposed to understand 3000 spoken English words (that's according to the wiki bonobo article, which references (guess what) the same Raffaele article we're talking about), so why does S-R need to use the lexigram at all ?

More importantly, both the article and the source refer to this 'experiment'. It would be nice to know the details of this experiment, which might describe how many objects Kanzi was shown, how often he vocalized, and how many times Panbanisha responded with accuracy, and so on.

I can't find this experiment. Tonight I contacted the Great Ape Trust, where S-R works with Kanzi, and asked for the reference. I'll let you know what they say. I'll leave off amending the article in the meantime.   """,0

A lot of IP adresses and new accounts tend to be like that but instead of reverting their edits, I leave a friendly comment on their talk page. Unfortuntely this doesn't stop them from blanking again as I've just found out. But I guess they just don't what to talk to anyone which kind of defeats the whole purpose of a talk page.

Also clicking a blue link to a users talkpage which is blank is also a big red flag. Or is it blue flag. Anyway, in this case I look through the page's edit history to find warnings.

 Unresolved sexual issues 

I find it unsettling that we censor reasons for suicide because we somehow find them personally offensive. In striving to become a neutral encyclopedia, filled with facts and free from personal bias, we need to show restraint in our censoring. We can't allow ourselves to think """"I find this or that reason for suicide offensive to me and therefor I will edit it"""" as a rationalization to further a personal cause. Suicide is a very tragic topic, reasons are many for suicide, our need to understand them, not shy away from them, is imperative if we want to prevent suicide. I understand that homosexuality is a very touchy subject and in any way linking it to something """"taboo"""" like suicide might be bothersome to some like Orpheus, but we need to be honest here. Unwanted homosexuality has been documented to be a reason for suicide, and thus should be stated.""",0

"Scenario after the second round 

All scenarios except 5-5-5-0 do not involve a three-way tiebreaker, so I only explain the 5-5-5-0 situation below.
If Spain draw with Republic of Ireland and Italy defeat Republic of Ireland, the three teams Spain, Republic of Ireland and Italy will have 5 point each, and 2 points each and 0 goal difference each among the three games among themselves. If the Spain-Republic of Ireland match ends at a draw of 2–2 or higher, Spain and Republic of Ireland will advance due to higher number of goals from games among teams in question. If the draw game is goalless, Italy will advance with a higher number of goals among teams in question while Spain and Republic of Ireland still tie. As reapplying the tiebreaker on the game between Spain and Republic of Ireland doesn't help, Spain will advance (with Italy) with a higher overall goal difference. If the draw is 1–1, the tiebreaker on overall goal difference applies. Therefore, the two teams with the best results against Republic of Ireland advance.",0

"Chokhor Rinpoche 
 A brief biography of fourth Chokhor Tenzin Chogyal 

Chokhor Rinpoche was born to father Kalsang Dorjee and mother Kalsang Chokey on 20th Oct, 1979 (the day was on auspicious day of Dipawali) in Kalimpong, the hill station of West Bengal, North East state of India. 

While Ripoche’s mother was pregnant, there were so many auspicious signs showed to her. She often dreamt of a white rabbit sleeping on her lap; thousand of twinkling stars entering to her womb and became different jewels. She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.

After a year, the little Lhundub used to do pray in front of the photo of His Holiness with the decoration different fruits as offering. He also used to sit on piled pillows and saying he is Lama and take his blessing, to his relative children. Moreover, the little boy was happy to visit monastery and meet monks.

When the little boy was on four years old, he often told his dream to his parent that he dreamt of a lord of charnel grounds [having the form of a skeleton] telling him that your home is not a place of long term living, you need to go far distance where there is huge temple, and you should go with two person who would come to invite you. Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.

In the beginning of year 1983, the little boy started to go English School in Kalimpong. In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.

While little boy, Lhundub Tsondue was on his routine to Nursery school, on 21st March, 1985, he was recognized as the unmistaken reincarnation of 3rd Chokhor Rinpoche by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.

Few days after his admission to the monastery, Geshe Jampa Topgyal taught few alphabets to read as dependent-arising. Then Geshe Gyaltsen took Rinpoche to consult Geshe Ngawang Choesang of Tsangpa Khangtsen as a teacher. On Geshe Ngawang la’s guidance of long fifteen years, Rinpoche learned from the beginning of reading and writing, Tibetan Calligraphy, Sumchupa and Tagjug, Tibetan literature. During the consultation of Geshe Ngawang la, Rinpoche memorized all daily prayers and the root text of (Abhisamaya Alamkara, Madhyamikavatara, Abhi Dharma Khosh).Recited hundred thousand of “Tendrel Toepa”,(Praise of Dependent Arising, by Tsongkhapa). While consulting Geshe Ngawang Choesang, Rinpoche also went to Sera Je Secondary School for five years. 

In 1988, during the Lamrim teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Chokhor Rinpoche got the first privately audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Drepung monastery. His Holiness gave him name “Tenzin Chogyal“.

In 1992, Chokhor Rinpoche left the academic studies and joined the monastic education with consultation of Gyume Khensur Lobsang Delek as teacher. In 1994, Rinpoche took novice vow from His Eminence Choden Rinpoche and added name “Palsangpo” after “Tenzin Chogyal” as novice name.

As the rule and regulation of the monastery, in 1996, 25th day of 6th month Rinpoche was stood on the Rigchung ceremony in the congregation of Sera Jey monks, everyone was surprised with his under/over tone of explanation with melancholic tune and answering of debate opponent.

While studying the fundamental philosophy in the monastery, on the two month vacation, Chokhor Rinpoche used to accomplish the recitation of Mig-tsema and some vocation took complete retreat on Yamantaka and had its burnt sacrifices. In 1999 Rinpoche was invited to Italy by his sponsor during the vacation, Rinpoche taught and gave lecture on Tibetan issue to Italian",0

I think there is a misunderstanding on what a """"tactical"""" victory is. It does not mean a victory of tactical formation, but rather a """"success in battle without substantive or long-lasting gain"""", as opposed to a [[strategic victory which is """"a success in a military campaign"""". If one sets ones sights low enough, and claim the goal of the operation was merely to establish a bridgehead, then it was a clear Soviet victory. However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do. While the overall campaign was a clear strategic victory for the Soviets because they won the campaign in the end, it was a tactical victory for the Germans because they were successful in holding Narva even though it was not long lasting, i.e. six months.

Hello,

I always welcome feedback for my efforts, most of which nowadays are editing and writing narrative nonfiction and novels.

And I do appreciate those who have studied the art and science of the English language, esp. grammar and usage. 

I especially love it when those who would criticize another's work do it decently and respectfully.

Having listened to the tone, color and texture of your message, I assume that you're not one of those I describe in paragraph two above. Further, I assume you're not diplomatic in your dealings with other people, in general. Either that, or you're just plain too lazy to be kind and decent. 

Telling me I'm """"wrong"""" is just plain rude, esp. when BOTH of us are correct, according to modern-day usage.

By the way, the correct way your sentence should've been structured is, """"No, you're wrong; it's perfectly acceptable."""" Of course, I may've said something like, """"You're both right, Dean. Happy editing and thank you for contributing to Wkipedia.""""

Of course, that's just I . . . or me, as it were. . . .

I wish you well in your future edits.

 Remedies 

These were removed from the article. While I agree that this had developed severe listcruft, surely some citations exist for some of these. Moved to talk page so people have an idea what to search for.
Potentially beneficial remedies
Aspirin: - acetylsalicylic acid, taken before turning in to bed (before, not after sleeping), might be effective.
 Consuming 3 grams of Butyl hydroxy toluen (BHT) prior to drinking is said to counter hangovers, by detoxifying acetaldehyde (presumably replacing gluthatione.)  BHT in this case is supposed to also block alcohol metabolism, so the person will stay drunk longer.
 Another possible remedy is the consumption of motion-sickness medicine or over the counter allergy medicine.  Specifially, consuming cetirizine prior to consuming alcohol is reported to counter the hangover.
Supposed remedies

Note: Most of these have not been scientifically tested or reviewed in the above articles.
 Water: this has been recommended scientifically. Hangovers are mainly dehydration; therefore drinking water before, during and after a drinking session will greatly decrease any hangover symptoms. A glass of water between each alcoholic drink is the best way to reduce hangover, as you won't easily become dehydrated; this also causes you to drink fewer alcoholic beverages. Drink as much water before sleeping as possible (within reason). It may not totally prevent a hangover but it will reduce headache. Continuing to drink water may help to alleviate symptoms more quickly.
 Nux vomica (homeopathic remedy)
 Milk Thistle
 Angostura bitters and soda water
 Defecation
 Vomiting
 Professional massage, reflexology (foot), and other detoxifying practices.
 A glass of buttermilk. Though many people dislike buttermilk, it will calm down your stomach and add liquid to the body.
 Having sex (or masturbation) may increase the release of endorphins, which in turn may help reduce the effect of a hangover.
 Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages.  Caffeine increases the effectiveness of analgesics, and therefore may reduce headache severity when used with aspirin or similar medicines.  Coffee has also been shown in some studies to have a protective effect on the liver, effective in preventing alcoholic liver disease. (Caffeine is a diuretic, which would further dehydrate the body. This is generally not a recommended remedy. Thus, tea, especially green tea, is indicated.)
 Nicotine, once again much like caffeine, increases the effectiveness of analgesics and its stimulant effects diminishes many hangover symptoms.
 Cabbage leaves or tomato juice
 Bloody Mary
 Michelada (popular in Mexico; one part tomato juice, one part beer, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi sauce or Soy sauce)
 Mixing in a tall glass two raw eggs with pepper, Tabasco sauce, and gin. Although the cysteine in the egg yolk may have a mild benefit, the pepper, Tabasco, and gin will have a negative impact.  Colloquially known as a """"Prairie Oyster"""".
 Drinking more alcohol is scientifically proven (see hair of the dog), a well-liked remedy. This will, however, only delay the hangover 
 Eating seafood is a popular """"remedy"""" in Chile.
 Coca Cola or Pepsi-Cola, otherwise known as """"Black Aspirin"""" (popular in Australia), also """"The Red Ambulance"""" (South African); the caffeine, bubbles and sugar can be easier to hold down than pure water.  Moreover, the low pH helps the enzymes in the stomach and the sucrose partially compensates the inhibition of the gluconeogenesis. 
 Taking a shower and oscillating between extreme cold and hot temperatures.  This practice has no effect on the hangover and can be unhealthy. Seen in the movie The Princess Bride.
 Eating canned asparagus before going to bed, purportedly a good cure thanks to the diuretic effects of asparagus.  Again, diuretics compound the problem.
 Ginseng tea is given to relieve the effects of alcohol.  If useful, it may be for its antioxidant and-or vasodilatation / microcirculation properties.
 Drinking a couple of table spoons of olive oil is said to be of great help

Common folk medicine has a wide variety of supposed hangover cures. A good hangover cure should replace essential nutrients lost by the body while counteracting the influence of residual poisons; very few cures do both at once. Among the more common proposed cures are:
Eating menudo, a very common remedy in Mexico; said to",0

 Favor. I believe the section is neutral enough to remove the neutral dispute tag. In order of Jefferson to get to GA status the article needs to not have any neutrality disputes. There is criticism of Jefferson for not speaking out on emanicipation during his Presidency, his reluctance to free his slaves, his reliance on slavery to support his aristocratice lifestyle, his rhetoric contradicting his slave ownership, and the Louisiana Purchase treaty increased slavery in the West. Positive statements on Jefferson was that he was a humane slaveowner, mentioning his proposal to stop slavery in the West after 1800, and he banned the United States slave trade. Editors can address any other issues without the neutrality dispute tag. The article does state he manummitted only a few slaves. As far as """"humane"""" that is a matter of subjection.

Richard Frye]: """"Although the Tura in the Avestan Age were most probably Iranian, perhaps the memory of the struggles with aborigines played a part in the development of the epic.  Later, of course, the Turks conveniently took the role of the great enemies of Iran.  The extent of the influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own history as well as that of Iran.  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history”(R.N.

In his ludicrous block against me Jdorney wrote the following """"Regarding the Irish Republican pages, this user pushes a POV agenda talking up the IRA's military effectiveness. He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney 

The most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge 

These accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser. 

All of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself """"SwatJester"""".

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"genocide"""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """,0

Three or four editors have censored the section in question; ten have maintained it. The three or four are very loud and aggressive, and claim to represent a consensus; that is just the  rhetorical trick known as bandwagoning (claiming that one's opinion represents the popular will, in order to con new people into adopting it, and thus bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy).

But consider this. The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide. Apparently, some cases of genocide are more equal than others.

"In Response

Dear “Lessheard vanU” and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators & Mr. Wales:   This is a very serious issue.  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one.  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia’s own editors and administrators.  As with Blackpearl14, who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don’t apply to her, and with other editors who uphold double standards.   Then when challenged to the double standards, including Blackpearl14's violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control, other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia’s own written polices.    “Lessheard vanU” had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a “harassing the editor”, outright agreeing with Blackpearl14.  Then in addition to IP address being blocked, all “talk & discussion” are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers.  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors & administrators, all of this has been recorded, including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page (copies have been secure)  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her.  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose.  Yet you have ignored that.

As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin",0

Personally, I think it is an important enough point to make in the first paragraph, although if Tim and others prefer moving it to the fourth paragraph I won't object.  However, I have to say I do not read the first paragraph the same way Graft does, I see no non-sequitor.  The subject of the first sentence is not inherited traits (that is in the predicate) and the subject of the second sentence is not fact versus theory (which again is in the predicate.  The subject of the first sentence is """"evolution"""" and the predicate provides a definition.  The subject of the second sentence is evolutionary biology - the field of academe that makes the study of evolution its object, and the source of just about all the contents of the article.  The third sentence goes on to tell us about what we learn from evolutionary biology.  This progression (define a subject, explain who studies/has expertise in it, then elaborate on this field of study) makes perfect sense to me. I don't mean to prolong any argument with Graft, but I just don't see this degrading the quality of the article or its educational value to a general readership.    |  Talk 16:30""",0

I know the elements articles are a PITA and involve a lot of defense from vandals and WP:NOR failers- it's not something I want to do. OTOH, it's a hard length to defend, based on my (non-elements) experience at RFPP. I'll dial it back and post a note on the talk page, but ultimately I won't be watching it, so feel free to change it back if it becomes necessary.

As far as """"amount of vandalism"""" is concerned, here are my top indications that protection is needed (see also: WP:ROUGH):
 Extreme vandalism (compare to the daily featured article, but generally > 5 unique IPs in 24 hours, or 3-4 unique IPs per day over a slightly longer period)
 Sockpuppetry, if protecting the article is easier than an IP/rangeblock. (see Pioneer Courthouse Square for an extreme example of this)
 BLP. This one is obvious. Especially for
 Unsourced fancruft. Usually this is for articles that are continually getting edit-warred about the genre of a band, or the rumor that someone won the latest season of Survivor, or pretty much any article related to wrestling/MMA.
 The squishy stuff: if an article is super-stable (compare diffs to 'cur', no productive changes over last 100 edits or N months) and the IPs never have anything to contribute.
The last one is really the sticking point. In the recent history of Vanadium (just looking to the 20th or so), I see two repeat-offender IPs and a couple of random ones. The repeat-offenders should be warned and blocked for a short time if they haven't been blocked before. If it were (was) me, I'd feel comfortable semi-protecting the article for 3 days, *maybe* a week if I was frustrated.
Finally, generally the semi-protection ramps up in length. So a common pattern I use is 3 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, then indefinite. Each time it should come unprotected and show big problems with IPs.
As an aside, I didn't mean for this to be so long, and apologies if you know all of this. I tried to cast it as a personal opinion because it somewhat *is*. And I'm being so verbose because you are a new admin (congrats, of course), and I'm hoping it helps without coming off condescending.

 You People... 
...Are hoping, begging and wishing for previlages, respect a title that you did not earn, go by on your own and are not deserving of.  You did not build the US, you had the Spanish Empire and it failed, not you come here by crossing the border and by boat.  Stop fooling yourselves.  BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.

Once the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.

If you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.

All of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask """"if they can be white, then why should I not be?""""  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!  

Sadly (for those of you with white dreams that is), you are lumped together with the rest of your latino brothers.  Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.

I still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.

Also, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning """"your type of whites as opposed to my type"""" which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.  Being white does not mean being a racist.  White is an American (USA) thing.  Most Europeans never thought of themselves as beinga part of a white people.  It is",0

 Problems in section Governance/subsection Law 

The following paragraph reads:

""""France does not recognize religious law, nor does it recognize religious beliefs or morality as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. As a consequence, France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, """"offenses against public decency"""" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. With such emphasis on public order, laws sentencing racism, sexism or antisemitism are also old and important. For instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.[93] Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.""""

This has to be removed, or at least re-written, because it is incorrect, and not supported by the source given. The fact that France does not recognize religious law is true, this can and should stay. The fact that is doesn't recognize 'morality' as a source of law is not. If so, why was adultery illegal until 1975?? Even worse, why were 'children born from adultery' discriminated in inheritance up until 2001(!), when France was forced to change its law by the European Court of Human Rights ?? In regard to sexism, which is addressed here - France was one of the last Western countries to recognize the rights of women - vote for women only in 1944, women could not work without the consent of husband until 1965, leniency for 'crimes of passion' under the Napoleonic Code etc. Let's not even open this subject...

"""== Discussing recombination ==

Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.

Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    

I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   

 Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America' 

""""A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""    

That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?

Not relevant here. The Evolution article is not about Charles Darwin, the film is not about evolution, and there is an entirely separate page for the creation–evolution controversy.

For a certain editor
""""In 1952 BMW in West Germany produced its first car since before the Second World War. The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.

These cars had some success in post-imperial Britain where there was no Marshall Plan and the Suez Crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. But Germany in the late 1950s was enjoying the fruits of Wirtschaftswunder. The country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the BMW Isetta Motor-Coupé, known colloquially but never popularly as “the egg”""""

Extract from: Car Wars, Fifty Years of Greed, Treachery, and Skulduggery in the Global Marketplace by Jonathan Mantle

But then there was a fuel crisis and so, briefly, the Germans bought it. What a happy happy accident.

""""The BMW Isetta. Despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship, BMW laid a multimillion dollar egg in the 1950s with its Isetta minicar, sneeringly dubbed, “das rollende Ei” or “the rolling egg” The Isetta’s engine was in the rear; passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a D-Day troop carrier. In fact, when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. As for safety, the entire vehicle, front to back, was one big crumple zone.

Steering the Isetta was difficult, largely because its body was tapered towards the rear, like a wedge of Emmenthaler cheese. Most models had only three wheels, which didn’t make the car any easier to control. But the design enabled the manufacturers to have the Isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.""""

As I'm sure many of you have surmised, there is something going on behind the scenes to which most editors of Wikipedia are not privy. My purpose here today is to expose it. In doing so, you may be tempted to minimize the problem by vilifying David Gerard or Carbonite, but their actions are only part of the surface manifestation, and penalizing them will only accentuate the dilemma. Finding fall-guys to punish will not fix the problem because the underlying problem is the system of punishment.

Systems of punishment
On Jpgordon's talk page, we see Carbonite punish the administrator with a forced """"time out."""" In response, Jpgordon leaves a message on Carbonite's talk page saying, """"Good call."""" Jpgordon's subservience to the system of punishment is directly evident in this example. Methods of indirectly empowering systems of punishment also exist.

We can disagree with Carbonite's methods while enabling them at the same time by acknowledging Carbonite's ability to control our will. But, does Carbonite have the innate ability to control our will, or do we grant him that power? Obviously, Carbonite cannot coerce us without our agreeing to allow him that authority. Our mind is our own, and our will is based purely on the systems we acknowledge.

When we buy into a system of punishment, as many of us have at Wikipedia, we are purchasing the whole package. It come complete with vandals, disrespect, flame wars, and content ultimately controlled by a very few individuals with little or no prescriptive editing experience.

Prescription
Language requires prescription. This is evident with a little thought-experiment involving two extremes. If you could only communicate with words that remained the same indefinitely after they are coined, communication would be entirely possible. However, in the opposite extreme, where official definitions instantly amended whatever meaning every disparate context assumed, propaganda and """"misuse"""" would soon render that language ineffectual.

Within the intended construct of Wikipedia, we don't have to understand how strong singular definitions empower a civilization. The Darwinism of thousands of disparate editors and competing ideas will naturally lead to a prescriptive definition. In areas of Wikipedia where we don't have top-down control of content, this is exactly what happens. Unfortunately, systems of punishment have become the rule at Wikipedia instead of the exception. Our love for this project creates expectations for its potential, but the fear of not reaching these expectations allows others to control us, closes our eyes to corruption and content control, and ultimately destroys the thing we love.

 Definitions of Beat vs. No such thing as a """"Beat"""" artist, Round 2: The Formal Argument Edition! 

Now let's get down to some actual business. Formal argument is necessary because this argument has degenerated so far (by me, mostly, just for fun). I'll break it down piece by piece so it's easier to digest for people unwilling to read what others are saying:

Purpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term """"Beat Generation"""" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who """"is"""" and """"isn't"""" a """"beat.""""

Proposal: We should fix the structure of the page 

Ginsberg Deliberate Prose:
""""The phrase 'beat generation' rose out of a specific conversation with Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes around '50-51 when, discussing the nature of generations recollecting the glamour of the lost generation, Kerouac said, Ah, this is nothing but a beat generation ... not meaning to name the generation but to un-name it.""""

He discusses the origin of the term """"beat"""" in """"hip language"""" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with """"beatific"""" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom's side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says """"articulated"""" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).

""""A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the 'beat generation literary movement.'

LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.

My worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement. On WikiSource you don't have as much history so there are less people watching you. It would be a much more pressured environment for you. Can you remain calm in these circumstances?   
My perspective on Wikipedia is much different now. I have enjoyed immensely Wikisource where, granted, the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging, so my editing energies can safely go there. (I have made close to 9,000 edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors.) I don't intend to get involved in the award culture on Wikipedia such  FAC, FAR or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards.  My first interest is fixing up articles that I would like to link to Wikisource articles, but are in such bad condition that I don't link. Secondly, I would create articles that are needed for explanations for Wikisource articles. I will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor, where an editor lists and article under articles """"I wrote"""" or refers to """"my articles"""" in posts. I will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor. Outside the FAC/FAR arena there is not much of a problem, I don't think, if any at all.  I have created over 600 articles in a multitude of subjects, mostly to fill in """"missing links"""" on Wikipedia. I will continue with low key endeavors such as that. However, at the sign of any """"push back"""" I will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor, or even editing Wikipedia for a while. Also, my misery was generated by a small group of editors. I am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an Arcom settlement.   — (Talk)

I do not dispute that Jack Dyer is credited with inventing the drop punt. Hugh Hinks invented the Drop Punt in 1907. Page 342 & 347 ì In The Beginning There Was Carisbrookî by Daryl McLeish, 2001.

Despite claims to the contrary Carlton believed  that Horrie Clover invented the drop punt. Teammate Newton Chandler believed that Clover first saw the kick used by a teammate at Carisbrook and that he perfected it from there. 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers.
 TABTAB
Len Metherell, who made his debut in 1930, see 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers, certainly used the drop punt, and indicated that he had learned it from his father. With the retirement of Dyer in 1949 the drop punt gradually fell into disuse. When Bartle, of Geelong, took a spectacular mark five meters from goal in 1958 and kicked a behind, the Geelong advertiser admonishes: he foolishly tried a drop punt. 3AW Book of Footy Records 1989 page195/6

Interestingly Jack Dyer commenced with Richmond in 1931 and would have played against Clover and Metherell.

Next recorded  use was by the Collier Brothers see Page 195 3AW Book of Footy Records.

Next recorded use was by Jack Dyer. The Sporting Globe FOOTBALL Book 1948.

Jack Dyer adapted the Collier Brothers of Collingwood’s Drop Punt, which they used as a short pass of around ten yards in place of a hand pass. They only used it to pass the ball to each other over the head of an opponent. See page 165, Jack Dyer Captain Blood as told to Brian Hanson, Paul, (London), 1965.

To claim that what isn't relevant? I agree with the suggestion of including some criticism of the term. As I have said repeatedly, the passage from Gardner does not criticize the term """"non-Aristotelian logic"""". It addresses a different use of the word """"non-Aristotelian"""". This by itself seems like sufficient reason to remove it. Furthermore, its current use in the article blurs the line between the two senses of """"null-A"""".

The Answer:

God, Lord of the worlds is praised. God bless the man of the envoys, our Lord Muhammed, his family and all his fellows and give them  salvation.

Herewith we grant information: since he is dropped from the islam, he will be invited for regretfulness. Does he not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the islamic law.

Referring to his children, so they are minor muslims. When they reach full age, and if they remain within the islam, they are muslims. If they leave the islam, they will be invited to regret. If they do not regret, they will be killed. God the almighty knows best.

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak. Assuming that Dalmatia was one of the most primitive of Europe at the time of Venetian domination, we must also think that since 1797 to the date you specified (1945) they are 150 years. Josip Smodlaka stated in 1911 (1911!) that Dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of Europe. As you can understand, we can not talk only of the Italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact.

"Questions over status

As already mentioned above the legal status of this constabulary IS a grey area.  I am a serving officer in the Met and many of my colleagues are unaware of the powers and remit of borough constabularies such as the WPP.  If serving front line police officers are unsure, then I have to say there is a definite grey area for the public.  I have done some research and discovered some interesting points which the article does not in its present form represent.  As a result, I and it would appear an anon editor have edited the article to try and make a better and objective article which reflects reality.  As it was, the article was subjective and questionable.  However these edits have been reverted without explanation – apart from comments such as ‘this is the truth’.  In effort to explain my edits and prevent an edit war I set out below my reason for altering the article. 

London Borough Parks Constabularies are, as is correctly quoted, established under sec 18 of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provision Order Confirmation 1967.  This act allows London borough councils to establish a body of constables who have the power to enforce parks bye-laws in their respective parks.  It does not make these constables ‘police constables’ and does not allow police services or forces to be established.  No police powers are given to these parks constables (with the exception of parks bye laws) over and above those which everybody is entitled, often referred to as ‘any person’ powers or as in the case of arrest, ‘citizen’s arrest’.  

In comparison, officers from Home Office forces (such as the Met, Kent Police etc) can point to the Police Act 1996 as the basis for their establishment, jurisdiction and powers as police constables.  BTP officers can point to the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.  Ministry of Defence Police officer can point to the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1986.  I could go on…My point is that all these police forces have a legal basis and with the attached powers to call themselves police officers and the organisations they work for police services/forces.  The WPP does not, unless someone can point to a piece of legislation that I have missed.

So the article started by saying, “Wandsworth Parks Police is a Police Service successfully run…”.  Two points about the opening sentence.  Firstly, its NOT legally a police service but a borough parks constabulary.  Secondly, the comment regarding ‘successfully run’ is highly subjective and without basis.  All organisations would like to be thought of a successful, but without any citation it should not be in an encyclopaedic article.

Under legal status the paragraph starts by mentioning the Met and working closely with it.  Irrelevant to legal status me thinks and again subjective.  Why mention a home office force in the legal status paragraph of a parks constabulary.  This paragraph should merely be about the legal status of WPP and its constables.  The paragraph rightly states that a magistrate swears WPP constables in, but not as ‘police constables’ but as ‘parks constables’ due to the legislation involved.  Once sworn in the parks constables have executive powers to enforce parks bye-laws in their boroughs ONLY.  Criminal law is not included.  However, just like the general public, parks constables can enforce criminal law in certain limited circumstances relating to indictable offences only.  This is commonly known as ‘citizens arrest’.  Due to changes in arrest powers with SOCAP in 2006, non police officers, such as parks constables need to be aware of the necessity criteria to make an arrest lawful.  My point is that the article read like the parks constables had police powers – they don’t (apart from the bye law aspect).  The paragraph then goes on to state that parks constables come under PACE.  Well this is obvious and irrelevant, any arrest by anyone is under PACE (as amended by SOCAP).  What it doesn’t do is give parks constables any more power than Joe Public (apart from the bye law aspect).  For all the above reasons, the last sentence of this paragraph (“They are always Parks Police Officers regardless of the technicalities of whether or not they are in the act of enforcing bye-laws.”) is not a true reflection of law and quite frankly wrong and misleading.  There is no such thing as a parks ‘police officer’. 

I had added at the bottom of the article two paragraphs with cited evidence which brings into question the status of parks constabularies and their use of the word ‘police’, blue lights and use of batons etc.  These were deleted without reason.  They are legitimate sources which shed light on the grey area.  You may not agree with the report and committee’s results but they are in the public domain and support my contention that there IS a grey area and WPP are treading on thin ice on occasion.

Constance Cumbey Update on March 5, 2005 at 10:44 p.m., E.S.T.

Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of """"cleansing actions"""", """"master races"""" and """"aryanism"""" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  """"Judaism:  evils of""""; """"Judaism, need for dissolution of"""".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, """"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .""""  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not """"Nazis""""  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.  The Club of Rome banner is one that Javier Solana flies the most proudly!""",0

 That was a pretty horrible thing you said you know. 

Did you actually bother to investigate CheeseDreams? did you check her ArbCom cases? Did you check how she deliberately and spitefully vandalised my user page? Did you bother to read any of the things I wrote? Where do you get off saying I enjoyed having CheeseDreams banned? I didn't do that: CD did that via her editing practices and disruption of Wikipedia. -  15:19, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Say what?! Look mate, I'm disputing the article, not CheeseDreams. The article is an essay written from an assumption (and in fact pretty much stated as """"fact"""") that Jesus was the """"new sycretism"""". This is, to put it frankly, quite far from the truth and though the info should be stated that such and such stated such and such, there should not be an entire article, especially one like CheeseDreams created. Why do you think I'm not opposing that a merge be done? Sheesh. You'd think I'm trying to destroy CheeseDreams life works or something. -  15:47, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I would NPOV the article if I could. I can't. Why? Because the material isn't reference properly. Incidently, don't hold your breath for CheeseDreams to come back. She posted her password to a known trolls page and forced another admin to log in to her account quickly and change the password. She no longer has access to her account! In fact, we found 5 verified sock puppets of CheeseDreams (all with the same password) and she no longer has access to these accounts. You might want to note that I did start adding material: I have created an article The Two Babylons, which I encourage you to help me make more complete (I've only done the first two sections - and not even that). In the process I edited the article to clear up some misconceptions of CheeseDreams (like for instance she called Alexander Hislop a """"scholar"""", which he most certainly wasn't). 
However, I'm not sure how much time I have for you. I'm a little confused personally. The other day I was accused by a Stormfront member of being a traitor to the white race and/or a Jew, however today you tell me I'm a Nazi. Would you people please make up your minds? I'm getting mighty confused. -  17:20, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

"""::*Reverts back to old original profile* I have had a think about this since my last comment: Your assumption is that any editor that tries to enter an opposite viewpoint to that of TM is somehow also being """"disruptive"""" and “difficult”. This is far from the case although this is how it might seem without deep analysis. Looking at the last 2 days for example, myself and other (what you might describe as anti POV editors) have – following discussion allowed two “pro TM edits to be allowed back into the article despite the fact they may not be “resource compliant or NPOV (See for example Orm Johnson on “cults” where I made the revert!) Also notice that”anti” editors have disagreed over the wording of so called “anti TM” sources meaning that they became more neutral in tone (see physiology section.). However, this has not been the case with other “pro” editors”. What this means is that another editors – even neutral ones – come across as seeming otherwise 

Where different points of view exists this must be cited in the article – this is the nature of an encyclopaedia and has been since the first one complied in the Enlightenment. You are also correct that other factors of the Tm organisation do indeed need discussion; however, to me the most important is the research. This is because, reading this article, one would assume that there is a general consensus in the scientific community that TM meditation – or indeed any meditation –has large and demonstrate health benefits including, increasing your life expectancy, curing cancer, and prevent coronary disease! However this is clearly not the case. I understand that as webmaster to NSR  (and thank you for the honesty of at least adding this to your profile) this maybe difficult to believe as your much cheaper form of mediation relies on the research of TM to promote it – but the research that supports such findings is blatant nonsense and no such agreement exits within the scientific community. This needs to be highlighted I am afraid. However the TM organisation will try anything to deny this. .

"Wii
Thank you for your updates to the Wii article. However, I must point out a few things:

As referenced here: 480p, 720x480 and 640x480 are both 480p, the difference lies in what ratio a set or program is displayed in, 4:3 or 16:9, not what resolution. 480p, 720p and 1080p all refer to the vertical resolution, not the horizontal.
The Wii-mote's input is entirely different than the PS3 controller.  The PS3 controller's technology has been utilized in PC controllers for well over 10 years (the only difference is that the PS3's is apparently supposed to sense forward and backwards movement.)  The Wii-mote's nunhuck add-on has the same functions, but the remote itself has pixel-perfect pointing, the PS3 controller does not.
As for Wii=wee, that has no place in the article itself as it only furthers the problem.  The article references toilet humor and that should suffice for informing anyone new to the name that it may conjure up other meanings.",0

 Placement of File:Swaggart confession screenshot.png 

Several times now, I've moved this image from the infobox to the section to which it is appropriate. One or more anonymous IPs keep pushing it to the infobox, and I've reverted each time. There's several reasons. First, the rationale for the image says """"To display iconic image in relevant context"""" for the purpose. Having the image in the infobox does not place the image in the relevant context. Having it in the section titled """"1988 scandal - Swaggart's confession and fallout"""" does. Second, Mr. Swaggart is still alive. Using a fair use image of him for depiction purposes (which is what infoboxes use images for) is entirely improper and proscribed by the Wikimedia Foundation (see Foundation:Resolution:Licensing policy #3).

Therefore, it should be okay to retain the first paragraph that is compiled from text on """"About the Author"""" from """"The Chamcha Age"""". At present, in web space, bspindia.org appears to be close in terms of being authentic in representing the views of the Bahujan Samaj Party, a political party founded by Kanshi Ram. Although this site claims copyright over the contents, it doesn't formally acknowledge the source from which it has drawn content that is available without copyright. I wouldn't mind writing to the webmaster@bspindia.org to get permission for use of content on their site for reproduction on wikipedia. 

Secondly, I can modify the article appropriately so that content from bspindia.org and other sources is only used as a source of 'information' instead of 'article content'.

 EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you.

I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.

I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:

(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. """") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """""""") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """""""")

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

Here's the regex
(date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$

I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.

"The opening paragraph/ introduction could be re-worded to sound a little nicer. I feel as though the introduction sets the stage for the entire article, so it is worth putting in the extra effort to make it flow. However the hyperlinks inserted into the first paragraph are good.

The outline of the bibliography is really good. However in the first paragraph, the sentence “Afterwards, he became a faculty member at the University of California, San Diego for 20 years.” sounds awkward, and could be re-worded.

The spacing between your referencing end notes and the start of a new sentence is not consistent. Make sure there is a space between the endnote and the start of the next sentence.

It might be beneficial to add a figure into your article in regards to the “Interactive Activation Model”. Could also potentially add one to illustrate backpropagation.

The first sentence in the “back-propagation learning algorithm” paragraph could flow a little better. 

Could also potentially add a chart in at the end of your article so summarize Rumelhart’s research theories. I feel as though this would really benefit your article because you mention so many theories.

Overall good article with a lot of good information. Also written in a way that would be easy for the general public to understand!

 Meaning of the name in Czech  
I had to correct the following statement: """"The boy named Crow"""" (""""Kafka"""" means """"crow"""" in Czech).. 

In fact the Czech word for crow is vrána (cf. cs:vrána). The actual (and exact) meaning of kavka is jackdaw (a bird of Coloeus subgenus), specifically the Western Jackdaw (Coloeus monedula, cf. cs:kavka) In surnames the middle consonant occurs spelled v or f but pronunciation behind remains the same: . 

While jackdaws and crows (Corone subgenus) are similar closely related birds and visual misidentification sometimes occurs, the semantical border betwen jackdaw nad crow remains clearly drawn in the Czech language, at least when looking from the jackdaw side towards crows. Crows feature more prominently in common parlance (proverbs etc.) - therefore sometimes other crow-like birds (ravens etc.) are called simply crows, but on the other hand if one says kavka he/she certainly refers specifically to a jackdaw and doesn't mean vrána (either of two species native to the Czech lands - Carrion Crow Corvus corone or Hooded Crow Corvus cornix). 

Being unfamiliar with Japanese naming of the various Corvidae I hope this will help to clarify the naming issue at least from Czech perspective. Presumably that inaccuracy/oversimplification arose in chain of translation across several languages.   """,0

"""::I am very surprised that """"Jack"""" is still eliminating verified sources and inserting his own editorializing into the """"sexuality"""" section while it is under active discussion here.  As the material I have restored to the section makes clear, this is not just a matter of three critics examining Rydberg's poems, nor is it sensationalizing.  While it would be inappropriate to examine the specific details of Rydberg's private life, his basic sexual orientation is a matter of absolute unanimity among all scholars and reference works that have considered the subject, and is an important aspect of Rydberg's life that should not be whitewashed or swept into the closet.  I would welcome a good-faith attempt by anyone to cast this material in a more acceptable light, as was suggested regarding the Thomas Mann article.  However, wholesale deletion of sources, insertion of misleading and deceptive quotes, and personal editorializing such as permeated the last edits to this section, should not be acceptable in any reference work.

Is your opinion that this is an """"uninteresting semantic point"""" as an expert in semantics or as an expert in Catholic theology?

E.g.:

There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.""""

To continue the Smith story, I found the book Men Against the Mountains, by Alson J. Smith (1965). I would have preferred Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West, by Dale L. Morgan (1953), but my local library didn't have it. Because both books were written prior to the 1967 discovery of the """"lost"""" journal, they both contain some errors in particulars of the 1826-27 travel route that were corrected in Brooks' book (1977). Facts were established earlier, however, for J. Smith's 1827 return to California and the completion of the expedition at Fort Vancouver.

I found that J. Smith visited San Jose, Monterey and Yerba Buena, California before heading north up the Sacramento Valley. The Alson Smith book doesn't give the exact route of travel from San Jose to Monterey, but it seems unlikely that the expedition passed through my home turf in Santa Cruz County (my original question). They probably used the more established El Camino Real by way of Mission San Juan Bautista.

MOVED BACK FROM MY TALK PAGE:
 Moved from London Victory Parade discussion page 

As this exchange has nothing to do with the topic of the article and has everything to do with you assuming that I am editing in bad faith and trying to catch me out in a way which is quite frankly pathetic, I am moving it from that discussion page to your talk page.  

What is the title of the book you wrote about Warsaw, Varsovian? Do you know what """"M-ka"""" is ? You lived in Warsaw for ten years , you said above. Please tell me what M-ka is.  
Travellers Warsaw. Not only do I have no idea what M-ka is but my assistant (27 years old, born in Warsaw and lived here her whole life) and the professor in the office next to me (56 years old and spent entire life in Warsaw) have no idea what you're talking about either.  
What part of Warsaw you or your assistant lived in?  
I live in Muranow, she lives in Saska Kepa. Has this got anything to do with the London Victory Parade of 1946?  
Is this the book you wrote?..I'm sure the answer is in a very book you claim to write... Ask your assistant what is N24-rka then. I'm really trying hard to convince myself that you are a real account. Please help me. Thansk  
No, I wrote the second edition. And took about a quarter of the photos too. Why not buy a copy and read it from cover to cover: you will not find the words M-ka or N24-ka anywhere in it. However, you will find a rather good joke about Copernicus (or at least a good joke for anybody who knows their Monty Python).  
Well...if you lived in Warsaw and your assistant lived in Saska Kepa whole her life she would for sure knew what N24-rka is. It is the number of only night bus that goes to Saska Kepa. People in Warsaw or """"Varsovians"""" just know these things. I was born in Warsaw and I lived there for many years. Everybody knows buses and trams numbers especially in their areas. EVERYBODY. If you asked me what M-ka or N24-rka is I would tell you right away and even in the middle of the night. But thanks anyway Varsovian.  
You really are comedy gold! Firstly, to speak for myself I have no idea which night bus I would take to get home: I use these things called taxis. Secondly my assistant says that you are an idiot (although I would never use such incivil language to you). N24 does not go to Saska Kepa: it goes to Praga-Poludnie. To get to Saska Kepa she would take N72.  
Of course Varsovian...whatever you say[].  
Thank you for yet again implying that I am a liar. I do wonder if it is ever possible for you to actually be civil towards people. Thank you for your comments as to which bus goes where. I suggest that you contact ZTM (the Warsaw municipal transport company) and tell them that their website is completely wrong: they list the N24 as not going to Saska Kepa  and the N72 as going to Saska Kepa .

 A problem with """"English Patriot Man"""" and his sockpuppets 

Hi. Lately I've seen you blocking some sockpuppets of a user named: """"English Patriot Man"""". I see that this man is nearly obsessed with Polish people. He seems to spread his anti-Polish propaganda by distorting the historical truth concerning World War II, nazism in Europe and racism against Poles. He is totally denying the sufferings of the Polish nation. 
Thank you so much for taking care of him, and taking care of the articles that are his main targets. However, now he might create another sock and log in from some other computer or place, so that his personal data and IP address would be totally different. This is why I suggest us to patrol the articles that are his main targets like:
 Racism in Poland 
 Racial policy of Nazi Germany
 War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II
 Nazi crimes against the Polish nation
 Invasion of Poland
 Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II

 Glossary of Nazi Germany
This guy is using multiple sockpuppet accounts to delete all the information about Poles being percieved as """"subhumans"""" or """"non-Aryans"""" by the nazis. In fact the only """"Aryan-looking"""" Poles that were accepted by Nazi Germany at the time, were kidnapped as children and underwent """"Germanisation"""", they were like 0.05% of the whole nation. The rest of the Poles were """"insufficient"""" to be a part of the nazi-ruled nation, and were treated only slightly better that the Jews. 
This guy, he spreads lies all across Wikipedia, therefore I thank you for your quick and effective actions Diannaa. If you'd need any kind of help in restoring the data which """"English Patriot Man"""" destroyed, just tell me. I will also try to patrol the articles about Poles.   """,0

There are ample internet sites that define traditionalist esoteric Christianity and this needs to be compared against the esoteric Christianity that was inspired by Margaret Starbird. Traditional esoteric Christianity that dates historically back thousands of years to Origen of Alexandria dealt with metaphysical matters. The common interpretation of Gnosticism widely held by maistream scholarship is that it was a dualist nature holding that matter was evil and rejecting the physical substance of Christ. This can be easily substantuated by reliable and independent sources from works published by mainstream scholars. It was the book Holy Blood and Holy Grail that was first responsible for twisting the idea that Gnosticism """"believed that Jesus Christ was a human being"""", and this became uncritically repeated ever since by those who uncritically follow the modern concept of the Jesus Bloodline. Again, it can be very easily verified by citing scholarly books that the Jesus Christ of Gnosticism was not a physical human being.

 Apple not such a great example

I'm going to leave editing for others, as it's proven futile for me to try to improve the article with my own edits. I'll focus instead on helping Ling.Nut get his new lede implemented. This version is a huge improvement, and I think is coming together quite nicely. I have a few further objections/suggestions:

1) """"These territorial gains left Israel three and half times larger than its original size...""""

I strongly object to this wording. This suggests Israel's territory expanded, and the assumption seems to be that there was annexation rather than occupation. Yet it's an uncontroversial point of fact under international law that the acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible, and the Israeli occupation and colonization illegal. This is reflected in UN res 242 and numerous subsequent resolutions. Suggest:

 """"This left Israel in control of three in a half times more territory than it had under the 1949 Armistice Lines.""""

2) """"Two days later Nasser requested and rapidly obtained the withdrawal of UNEF troops from Egyptian territory, and the following day Egyptian forces replaced UN positions at the strategically vital point of Sharm el-Sheikh, which overlooks the geographically and politically vital Straits of Tiran.""""

Suggest adding after this:

 """"Israel rejected proposals to have UNEF restationed on its side of the border.""""

This is extremely relevant for the context, and particularly with regard to the discussion of whether the war was """"preemptive"""" or not. Had Israel truly feared an Egyptian attack, it could very well have accepted the UNEF buffer, yet it refused. Why? If this fact is not mentioned in the lede, it should at the very least be mentioned in the body of the article in the section on that topic. Forgive me if I overlooked it, but I didn't notice it there scanning through.

3) """"Though few material facts of the war are in dispute, the motivations and intentions of the national leaders on both sides has been the subject of much speculation and debate.""""

Minor grammar error: """"have"""" not """"has"""". Plural subject.

4) """"The Six Day War has been characterized as a preemptive war, an """"inadvertent war"""", and an action designed to preserve the credibility of Israel's deterrence strategy, as well as other things of a more controversial nature.""""

Look, I'll be the first to agree that both South Tyrol and Alto Adige are used in English,  it is really about 50/50 (especially in the UK).  In the US it is almost completely Alto Adige (because our interaction with Bolzano is mostly thru agriculture).  Here are some examples of Alto Adige being used  and .  Yes, the German speakers can make similar arguments for South Tyrol usage, and we can go on and on and on.  That is why the original compromise was made, to use Alto Adige and South Tyrol in the lead paragraph, and use the Province of X location (as is done for every other province of Italy on Wikipedia) for the article.

 Neo-Nazis on Wikipedia  

With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  

Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.

The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text """"military salute became the Nazi salute.""""

Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. """"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” 

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""  

Recently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the """"Roman salute"""" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America."""" Wikipedia liars also used the painting """"The Oath of the Horatii"""" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.

Similar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.

Wikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer """"public schools"""" when they mean """"government schools"""" and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called """"military socialism"""") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.

Some regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of",0

Your comment- Well, quite frankly, not everyone subscribes to that notion, and it is quite wrong of you and a handful of others to push your ideology onto people who hold a different opinion on the matter. There is simply no actual person named """"Chelsea Manning"""" here. What we have is a man named """"Bradley Manning"""" who wants to be called by this other name (and awhile ago it was reportedly """"Breanna"""") and referred to as """"she"""". That is all.

Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called """"Chelsea"""". That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say """"Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act..."""" and so on.

"Mouse versus fruitfly
There is some interesting stuff about the comparison between doing this prize with a mouse and doing it with fruitflies (drosophila). A couple of the more interesting points are that in a lab you can cheaply maintain and process larger numbers of fruitflies than mice, and the fruitfly lifespan is much shorter than the mouse lifespan so you get quicker feedback.

But I also understand the publicity argument that people feel more kinship with mice. It's easier as a non-scientist to believe that results in mice are much more relevant to humans. Results in mice will more easily attract funding for subsequent work.

Does it make sense for researchers to work with fruitflies first, and then port their techniques to mice for later 
confirmation and to collect the prize? Hopefully that would take relatively little more time and expense than doing the whole thing with fruitflies. We'd eventually need to port these techniques from mice to humans anyway, so there is a presumption that porting across species is feasible.",0

"""As for the change in """"Romanian"""" to """"Reich"""", yes it is difficult to work out what Caldwell is referring to. It seems this particular mission was a diversion to the synthetic oil plants in W.Germany (not Polesti). RAF Bomber Command used an attack by the 8AF to attack this target.
The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.

More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your """"give me a quote"""" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 
1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the """"oil"""" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med. Theatre). So your generalisation of a """"quote"""", if this indeed is what it is, makes the Bulk of the German fighter force concentrated in Romania false.

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

"Seriously did you just quote a title from a general history book? Dubious to say the least. Wouldn't you rather have the article more detailed in describing the state? Persianate state, Seljuk Turkic-ruled. You have one line which describes the Sultanate of Rum in more precision than you quoting off a title from a general history book that's not even specialized with the detailed history of Seljuks in the first place. But that's not the major dispute so let's not even pretend this is what the argument's about. Secondly, back to the Persianate source, your point is still invalid. The culture of the Great Seljuq court was adopted by the Sultanate, therefore the Sultanate had the same court system. I cannot believe you're actually contesting this, since there are plenty of sources which describe the Persianate identity of the Seljuks as a WHOLE, be they Great Seljuks or Rumi Sultanates. And to further prove this point is the fact you have them adopting Persian officially and courtly. Sorry but your edits were weird to say the least, because you moved a source unrelated to arts and architecture to that respective section, probably for the reason of disguising facts. Listen man, what happened a thousand years ago cannot be changed. Moving things around on wikipedia isn't going to change what happened I'm afraid.",0

Inquirer.net is a reliable resource but the particular Inquirer.net article that you used as reference never mentioned that the Ang Dating Doon segment is a parody of Ang Dating Daan. In fact, the name of the program Ang Dating Daan cannot be found anywhere on that Inquirer.net article. Therefore, it does not qualify as reference, not because Inquirer.net is not reliable, but because the idea that you're trying to convey is not supported by the article. Dar book, it is actually you who is bellittling Philippine-related articles by your reckless and uneducated editing. If you truly value Philippine-related articles then you should be extra careful not to destroy their quality and credibility. Also, since you are editing the Tagalog Wikipedia, may I suggest that you begin creating a Tagalog version of the English WP articles on Eli soriano and Ang Dating Daan? If you don't do it, someone else is going to do it sooner or later. The information on the different language versions of WP must match (or at least approximate) the best and most comprehensive article, which in the case of Eli Soriano and Ang Dating Daan happens to be the English version. –   20:23",0

"Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii
Ekadashi, in Vedic (Vaishnava) calendar is a fasting day. This is day of Lord Hari (Vishnu), so one has to dedicate this day to Vishnu, thus one has to do more fasting, especially from crops (beans). In Vedas persons refrain from meat, eggs, flesh/blood 'food' completely, but on this day (Ekadashi) one even refrains from beans/crops like rice, as Kali (material lust) may hide there on Ekadashi day. This day Vishnu has to be satisfied and not our tongue, belly etc.

Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii occurs during the light fortnight (shukla paksha) of the extra, leap year month known as Adhika month. This Adhika month is considered to be very auspicious (adhika = best or greatest), as Vishnu appearing Himself. This month (Adhika Maasa) comes once every two (sometimes three) years, and so also this Ekadashi. Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii'' comes on Purushottam Shukla Paksh'''.

"My comment
My comment: The believers of semitic one god religions (Christians, Moslems...) have rights [[see Category:Wikipedians by religion)]] to express their beliefs in semitic one god religions whose doctrines not only dislike the people who are not their believers, but also stigmatize, demonize and persecute the people who are not their believers, while the unbelievers of semitic one god religions have no right to simply express their opinion, feeling an attitude of dislike. The suggestion of deleting the templates is so ridiculous and despotic. Is the suggestion equitable,  fair, just and persuasive? -

 Mangojuice, I am not against articles on coats of arms as such, that would be absurd. I am against using Western Sahara as a subsitute for the """"Sahrawi Republic"""". This is where the bug lies and this goes across all topics related to the Western Sahara conflict where koavf is involved (with his systematic reverts).
 Western Sahara is, again, 1) a disputed territroy and 2) under Moroccan administration. It has as such no national coat of arms (a part may be from the one of the power that administrates it). To have an article showing the coat of arms of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" on the disputed Western Sahara territory is nothing but using wikipedia for Polisario political interests!
 The """"Sahrawi Republic"""", which is nothing but a governement in exile, has one however. It can appear on its page, I have no problem with it.
 Result: None - as far as I am aware of - is wanting to delete """"Coat of arms of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic"""". It should only not be same as """"Coat of arms of Western Sahara""""
 I don't know whether this is clear or not, otherwise happy to discuss every detail.
 The problem we are having with koavf is that he is a fervent militant of the """"Sahrawi Republic"""" and wants absolutely to have Western Sahara be a subtitute for this republic ín Wikipedia.
 And he is editwarring everyone who thinks differently, even when this costs him to be blocked on indefinite, and again and again.
 Only a strong admin can stop him. The best solution would be to ban him from editing the topic as had been suggested once already.
 Unfortunately he is unblocked every time by admins who want to show good will, although he does not care and just ignore them once they have unblocked him.
 We are having this situation not for the first time now and this is really exhausting!

"NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL 

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",0

There is mentioned in the article: “Prussia (later Germany) thus he was a German citizen.”  I think you do not tolerate the thing the nationality is before that.

You mean on territory of Poland. Yes I believe it is if you are Polish citizen and you enter Polish territory you can not disregard the any the duties as such.

"Pesher theory, Satanic Attack or Religion Novice
One could interpret Dr Thiering's pesher theory as a Satanic attack
to discredit deity in religion... at best. Or one could simply chalk
it down to a novice babbling away.

From St Augustine through 1,000s of saints and experts, deeper understanding
reveals divinity to be real, including that of Jesus and heaven, etc.

The final proof then will be in the Second Coming which pesher theory would
equate to only a human being who is a larger teacher of mankind; but when
Christ comes again shortly and creates endless miracles, as healing across
the entire face of the earth, such tripe as pesher will be seen to be 
what it is, babble, from someone who has no depth of understanding of

 Consecrated life

 Further on Amdo 

Hi, I appreciate your additions to the History section in Amdo. However, regarding the latest addition: """"According to [[Tibetan Government in Exile]], [[Chogyal Phagpa]], the head of the [[Sakyapa]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], became the religious instructor of Kublai Khan. In exchange, Chogyal Phagpa received the support of Kublai Khan and assumed political power over the three provinces or cholkas of Tibet.[http://www.tibet.com/status/3kings.html The Three Dharma Kings of Tibet] This intereaction called priest-patron (in [[tibetan]] chöyön) relation was the first in history of Tibet and was also developped under afterward circonstances[[Tibetan sovereignty debate]]."""" I wanted to query two things.

First, the Amdo article is about the Amdo region, not Tibet, and not the """"sovereignty debate"""". While I can see how the relations with the Mongols can be relevant, since the Mongols first incorporated Amdo into other commandaries/provinces, I don't think we need too much detail on the relations between the Mongols and Tibet - that is dealt with in other articles. Furthermore, it is bad form to use internal reference: i.e. another Wikipedia article cannot be used as a reference. Finally, this statement presents only one point of view when clearly there are several. I don't want the History section of Amdo to turn into a rehash of either History of Tibet or Tibet sovereignty debate.

I propose to cut the added paragraph to """", a relationship which the Tibetan Government-in-Exile now terms a """"patron-priest relationship"""" whereby Tibet exchanged political control for the power of religious instruction of the Khans.[ref]"""".

Much to my chagrin and dismay, I'm only Norwegian by heritage (& half-Norwegian at that). My paternal family left Norway in 1868. I do translate some Norwegian (& German & French & a small bit of Spanish & even a very little Russian) on occassion—more Norwegian than other languages since I'm working on improving my Norwegian.

According to Simon Schama's book The Power of Art, Guernica was painted in response to an article that Picaso saw in an French newspaper. The first line suggests that he was already working on the project when the bombs fell. He had agreed to do 'a politically minded painting' for a 1937 Paris Fair, but he had not decided what he was going to do until after the events in Geurnica unfolded. It was a front page photograph of the inferno that inspired the work.

 

""""Quite possibly apocryphal""""
I cut this from the article.

A story, quite possibly apocryphal, circulates about Guernica. During World War II, a German officer sees a copy of the painting for the first time, in the presence of Picasso.  In a wondering tone he asks Picasso """"Did you do this?"""" and Picasso replies: """"No, you did.""""

If it is """"quite possibly apocryphal"""" and we have no attribution or citation, it does not belong in the article.   | Talk 02:33, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Except that this is extremely widely believed and noted.  I recall hearing the equivalent when I was at the Prado. -  02:40, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Then someone should be able to find a citation at least of the anecdote being told. (& was Guernica ever in the Prado? In the early 80s it was in an annex to the Prado and then was moved to the Reina Sofia, no?)   | Talk 07:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Duh, yeah that is what I meant to say. It has been 4 years since I was there.  Yes, I would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote. -  13:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:
Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, """"Did you do that?,"""" Picasso coldly had replied, """"No, you did."""" 
Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)
 We can certainly cite the fact that Picasso himself told a (possibly apocryphal) story. It makes the line his, even if it's not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances.   | Talk 16:05, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)
 Yes, if Picasso really told it. So far, no sources are backing up that website (or even just repeating that version), so I'm not too keen on it. Otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before.  · Talk 16:46, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)

I'll quote the relevant part for you:

Here's my best guess for who Slim Virgin's first account was:

I'll say why:

1) Created the Yvonne Fletcher article, just 1 minute after he had made his first edit to Pan Am Flight 103
2) Made many edits to Yvonne Fletcher article insisting that a marksman killed her, and pushing many conspiracy theories about it.  Encouraged links to Joe Vialls' sites on it.
3) Received a new user message on 14 December 2003, yet first edit wasn't until 17 January 2004, suggesting Darkaddress was in some trouble, and had edits wiped from history.
4) Basically stopped editing in July 2004.  Only made 2 edits since Slim Virgin started in November 2004.  These two edits were minor:  and , and were 6 months apart from each other.  This is suggesting that Darkaddress had a sock puppet.

Of course, this is all going with the theory that Slim Virgin is Joe Vialls.  It is just a theory.  It is at this stage a very thin theory, and I am hoping for some more meat towards it.  However, Joe Vialls is the only person I can think of who is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing and also is anti-Jews.  And, make no mistake, Joe Vialls is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing.  He is also an expert on Yvonne Fletcher.  Indeed, he is an expert on Jews themselves.  He just happens to hate them, and blame them for everything.  Joe Vialls is also a former policeman turned detective turned journalist and conspiracy theorist.  Supposedly Joe Vialls died last year.  Joe Vialls is extremely secretive, and nobody really knows who he is.  He also likes to sign his name """"JoeVialls"""".  A bit like """"SlimVirgin"""" eh.

A little clutching at straws, I must admit, but it is at least a theory that fits.  Let's see if anyone can come up with a better one.""",0

"With respect, you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country. Getting off the subject a little, but it does have some relevance, the NZ Herald routinely refers to NZ'ers of European descent as 'Pakeha', where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating .. although this attitude is softening. Of course I would not include this in any article (and defintely not this one) without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research, I note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country.
What is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of 'hits' for rooster found in NZ media. Many of these hits will be refering to the Australian league club Sydney Roosters and not the poultry. Clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the country's readership than poultry.
Just stating both 'Cockerel' and 'Rooster' are used is factual, whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data, and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject.
Also, I can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both 'Cockerel' or 'Rooster' are common.",0
"""POSTED FROM MARYLAND TALK PAGE WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM Thisisbossi

I'm getting the sense of a double standard for Maryland here. Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...

If you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, 

 """"Virginia is known as the """"Mother of Presidents"""", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the """"Mother of States"""", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.""""

How is that anymore relevant than proclaiming """"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.""""? Doesn't talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?

Not convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,

Wisconsin's rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.

In previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it's a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?

Didn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

During the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.

The state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.
As of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.

Must I continue? It should be clear by now.

My version was hardly all about geography: it had a sentence touching upon its Civil War history as well as some information on its population and economy.

This is what you left posted in the intro

Example:

""""The opening movement  is performed by all forces with the exception of the recorders """" (emhasis added) contains an interpretation which can not be sourced to a (primary source) score. Unless the editor of that score inserted a text note to that effect (or Bach wrote such note in his manuscript which I don't think is the case here). In that case the name of the editor needs to be given (the editor is the source, not the music Bach wrote down and which was transferred to a printed score), preferably also date of publication, etc.
I'd recommend to change all """"score"""" references to a publicly available score (if possible). Then the interpretations that aren't directly clear from the music notes and accidentals on the page, get different references with named authors.

You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word.

[edit] Instructions
First, take a look at the username policy to make sure the username you are requesting is appropriate. Also, please note that for technical reasons, your username cannot begin with a lowercase letter, nor can it contain any underscores. 
Check to make sure the username you are requesting is not already taken. Do this by searching for the name in this list. If the name appears in the list, even if the link is red it is taken. Do not create an account under the new name. We'll do that for you. 
Log in with your present username in order to place your request. Renames will not be approved if the requestee is not logged in. 
Click here to place a request. 
Replace the text """"CURRENT"""" with your present username. 
Replace """"NEW"""" with the username to which you wish to be renamed. 
Fill in a reason where indicated but do not add anything in the """"subject/headline"""" box. 
If that doesn't work, simply copy the following text to your computer's 'clipboard': 
 CURRENT → NEW 

 Reason: Reason for requested renaming.   
Go to the """"Requests"""" section of this page, click the """"edit"""" link, and paste the text at the very bottom. Modify it as indicated above. 
Make sure that you have spelled both names correctly. Save the page. 
Check back periodically to answer any questions that may arise regarding your request. Do not be surprised if you suddenly cannot log in to your old account; this merely indicates that you should log in under your new name as the request has been fulfilled. 
Please be patient. It may take a few days for your request to be completed. 

Effects of a username change 
When the rename has been completed, your account will have been renamed, and any contributions you have made (including deleted contributions) will be reattributed to your new account as a background process. Your account preferences, watchlist contents, password, etc. will all be preserved, and your user and user talk pages will have been moved to the new name. 
Note: The process responsible for reallocating old contributions is currently dependent upon the job queue mechanism. As such, you may find old contributions do not immediately appear under your new account; this is perfectly normal. Updates should take at most a day to complete, although the length of time will vary according to the size of the job queue on this wiki, and the status of the server processes which process this queue. 
The change will appear in the user rename log and the request will be moved to the archives in the interest of transparency. It is not possible to rename accounts without an entry being created in the log. 
This change will not affect signatures you have already left on talk pages, or other places where you signed your username with   . Those pages will continue to display your signature (including the link to your old username) unless edited manually. 
Be aware: Once you have been renamed, your old account will no longer exist and may potentially be recreated by a third party. This is true even if your old account pages have been redirected towards your new account. To guard against impersonation, you may wish to recreate the old account yourself.""",0

They lost every battle  with foreigners they ever fought, placed themselves under Byzantine suzerainty amd were saved from extinction by Croats who crushed Bulgarian aggression

3. there are historical documents galore, which testify about Croatian legal, parliamentary and cultural continuity: from the times of Trpimir and Krešimir to the later corpora.

4. Croatian language heritage in the vernacular is well attested in from the 13th century on (at least). They Croatian name is explicitly mentioned in various sources, both Čakavian and Štokavian, particularly in Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Bosnia. Moreover, linguistic characteristics are the same as with contemporary (mid-19th century) Croatian language. On the other hand, Serbian written works, up until Dositej and Vuk (1780-1820), were written exclusively in Church Slavic language. Serbian literature until Vuk is, essentially, a variant of Church Slavic literature flourishing in Byzantium influenced area. Hence-Vuk's linguistic pan-Serbism, which tried to appropriate all štokavian vernacular literature is, evidently, a falsity and concoction.

5. early Slavic studies (Šarařik et al.) were deluded in ascribing parts of the Croatian literature to the Serbian heritage.

6. Serbian ethnic affiliation, in modern terms, is a relatively new phenomenon in Croatia. The major part of Eastern Orthodox inhabitants of Croatia, who actively participated in the Croatian cultural life (Illyrian movemont) have begun to show Serbian national allegiance only in recent (1850s) years. 

Virtually all Starčević's claims are corroborated by historical sources available at his times. Whether the veracity of historical sources like the DAI can withstand the test of time-this is another question. But, from the vantage point of mid-19th century clash of Serbian and Croatian ideologies, Starčević polemic stands as an example of skilled, sometimes sardonic and always truthful debate-without distortions, lies or misappropriations.

I'm sure it is not your intention to spread misinformation about the trial by using this discussion page for that purpose, now that the main page has been partially locked, but the net effect may be the same if you continue to enter statements in the discussion which are not based on the established facts of the case. Please bear in mind that the existence of the bloody footprints that had been cleaned away are not disputed by the defence, but the identity of the footprints was disputed. Therefore we may fairly presume that at least some parts of the apartment had been cleaned so that blood was no longer visible to the naked eye.  """,0

The infamous block

Veritas: do not get Wikinoid yet. The policy is on my side: it was a totally unjust block and I am appealing. I still trust Wikipedia. I don't trust so much certain wikipedians and administrators but I have faith that in the end truth, justice and NPOV shall prevail. If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack, at least in first instance, in ArbCom. Policy is very clear and Shell Kinney simply broke all rules. 

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield... (oops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties. 

Ironically Shell Kinney is running for ArbCom herself. Guess that her campaign is something like """"Wikipedia needs an iron man and that's me"""" of Thatcher. I don't know. I'm voting a more promising candidate.

I think the intitial problem here is a WIkiepdia-old ownership issue - the very language Parrot of Doom uses gives this away. Although I agreed with his revert in this case (there are better ways present the fact of Griffin's well known bigotry than just to define him a 'bigot'), when I read his """"biased garbage"""" edit note I was appalled at both the rudeness and politics, and planned to warn him myself tonight. As with myself, Nfitz is an experienced editor (from 2005 in his case, 2006 in mine). Also, I am VERY worried about Parrot's real stance on far right issues, despite what he says about Griffin on his user page. It’s an unfortunate truth that many people who so foolishly support the BNP just want certain policies and issues to made more public, and are not at all Griffin fans. I hope people can digest that comment. The BNP are also very, very clever, and without question far right – so I think we are all entitled to be wary of them from a Human Rights stance, whatever some people might insist about dotting each ‘i’ of the WP:AGF policy. Parrot has reacted to edits in this manner before, and if he (or anyone else) does it again I won't hesitate to make an official complaint, both on the rudeness and bias in the content.

No matter what friends you make on Wikpedia, people like Slim Virgin (and others complementary of the trimming of likely problems from the Griffin article in time for Question Time) won't be stupid enough to defend totally uncalled-for civility indiscretions to time-served editors who are CLEARLY acting in good faith. Especially given the dangerous politics involved from one side only here, and considering what should be expected to happen from the middle ground with this article being so plainly lily-livered - about a terrifying political disease that so nearly destroyed Europe. They won't be so keen to line up, and will answer to people like me if they are too hasty. And Jews perhaps, Muslims, blacks - people like that? I'm still reeling from the 'mainstream' introduction I saw here last Thursday. I insist the BNP could not have come up with a better article themselves, as any showing less of their true values would hardly pass. The article had 100,000 hits (obviously - how can we be surprised about that?) and single-handedly proved right the nationally-made argument on why Griffin should not have been invited to the TV show: the irresponsible media (mainly Wikipedia, alas) will be able to casually present Griffin as a standard mainstream politician. And all in the name of supposed damage-limitation to Wikipedia's own credibility. 

Parrot please - take a step back from the 'tired owner' stance, or you yourself will cause the kind of editing problems you claim you've been striving to avoid.

One day on this encyclopeda the reader will come first. Any argument that says prospective far right voters (if I'm actually allowed to use that term 'far right'?) can cleverly ‘read between lines’ - or even bother to read to the end of articles - is simply fully naive. Besides, the introduction is king with the reader, as it summerises what is below it. The majority of BNP supporters are THE most vulnerable people in Britain – and often the least educated. Wikipedia consistently ignores both the reader and the subject in its self-providing calculations, and with this deliberately damage-limited article (to put it most politely), it has manifestly helped to ‘rubber stamp’ fascism in the UK. A lot of people (esp non-Europeans) won’t know what that means, but many of us would agree that Wikipedia can scarcely have had a lower day.   """,0

You are presupposing that Asparagaceae (or perhaps """"Asparagaceae"""") is defined under the ICN. The code, however, claims merely to regulate nomenclature, providing definitions only of words like """"cultivar"""" (in Appendix VII), words that do not name taxa. Even if you can produce a reliable source for your claim that names are defined in terms of a type and a rank (a claim that is also made in the lead), you have a problem with neutrality; Monsch (2003), for example, argues that names do not have definitions. The ICN entries, on this view, only fix the reference of names, while a definition—if one were possible—would provide the meaning.

Relevant/Accurate Facts?
Many of the facts or generalizations are in fact opinions.  For instance, the suggestion that one million dollars is needed to live in the US without working is highly subjective.   (one could live on $500,000 quite easily, based on the average rate of return for conservative investments like mutual funds.)  Furthermore, actual cash is not necessary - many people live comfortably on businesses worth less than $100,000 that they own.

Also, using Marxist language in the initial definition shows a political POV, as in """"The main defining characteristic of the working class is its dependence on wage-labor (or salaried employment) as the main or only source of income, because of lack of capital assets or land that could provide an alternative source of livelihood.""""  In reality, one could argue that the main defining characteristic is simply whether one is in management or whether one uses physical labor or 'brain' labor.  In today's economy, it is not simply the lack of capital assets or land that may indicate working class, but also a lack of marketable knowledge.  You can own 100 acres of rural land in most US states that would be impossible to earn a living on, while having the right knowledge could earn you a living anywhere.

Finally, the alleged sexual habits of the working class (citing research 57 and 32 years old) is irrelevant to this article unless we are going to take the ridiculous practice of defining working class by their sexual habits.  Also, judging certain sexual habits as sophisticated shows a POV and this whole section is childish. 01:11, 16 October 05""",0

 Comments on Mediation 

added comments at [ Mediation Cabal#Comments from an outsider-Steven McCrary]

 

 Major Restructuring 
Major resturcturing of this article was long overdue.  The article was almost entirely one long, long section, ironically called """"Overview"""".  I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn't a pilot episode of TAGS).  

I added some new content but I did not remove existing content because I figured this restructuring was such a major change that I figured to take one step at a time.   Please note that I did not move everything.  All content that was not moved (most of it) was left where it was but the section was renamed """"Commentary"""".  I did not want to change too much all at once.  Much of that content is indeed commentary (not strictly factual) but some of it is still needs to be moved to more appropriate sections or deleted if duplicate information.
 

Thanks for the hard work.  I wanted to work on this some time ago, but because of the situation recounted above that went to the Mediation Cabal and the """"truce"""" proposed I have been reluctant to make any changes here.  Nice to see others are of the same mind.   

Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn't know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn't add any duplicate information. Please feel free to move it around or take it out if it isn't necessary.  

 New (Big) Problem re: Episodes List 
The list of Andy Griffith episodes was apparently started in October 2005.  Many different people have worked hard on it, and it has always been the only episodes list linked to from The Andy Griffith Show.

As I was revising the structure of The Andy Griffith Show (see above) I noticed that the list of episodes was actually misnamed.  It is, and has always been, located at List of Andy Griffith Show episodes.  Please notice that the mistake is that the word """"The"""" was missing from the title (The name of the show is """"The Andy Griffith Show"""").  Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word """"The"""" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show's article.  However when I tried this I was surprised to discover that I couldn't do that because another article was already named List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes (with the """"The).

Through dumb luck (or bad luck) I discovered that another user had started creating an list of Andy Griffith episode on their own, under their username where nobody else knew it existed.  This article was started after the original and was basically hidden from others.  Just this month the user that created the alternate episodes list moved their article to List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes, although the main show's article still doesn't point to it.

So there's the situation.  We've got two lists of episodes.  What to do?  Pros and Cons while staying neutral:  The original list is mistitled but has always been the only list linked to from the main article at The Andy Griffith Show.  Because it was always public more different people have worked on it.  The newer article is almost as old but it was """"hidden"""" in a user area until just this month.  I will admit that the newer article looks nicer in style, structure, colors, etc. but IMHO I think the descriptions are better in the older, public list,",0

the guy's persistence.  Follow his user contributions. They go round the clock almost at five minute intervals with a break at 2 o'clock in the morning New York time (he lives there) and resume five or six hours later.  So he does nothing else.  I have to admire such dogged persistence.  In fact the two human qualities I most admire are (1) that kind of persistence (2) faultless, eloquent and persuasive reasoning.  A sad fact these are so rarely combined.

You're being negative and unhelpful. I did not """"the thumbs down on my talk page before you got around to the article itself"""", the draft itself is automatically a """"Wikipedia Talk"""" page due to the nature of the WP:Articles for Creation format. But instead you prefer to leap to the conclusion that I did not read your article, despite it being clearly on a """"Talk"""" page for admin reasons, like all AFC articles.

Secondly, I did not say that NYT isn't """"notable"""", so that's a specious allegation. You have overall not provided reliable coverage since you've provided only one single source. You allege that """"So a mass panic in two NYC borough's is not notable enough then? Really!""""; well, that's true per Wikipedia:Notability_(events)#Duration_of_coverage: Notable events usually receive coverage beyond a relatively short news cycle. As very clearly stated in my comments: if this 1939 event is important, than people since 1939 will at least have occasionally mentioned it. It is incumbent on you as the submitter to find evidence that it has ever been discussed since.

I don't appreciate your allegations that I have failed to WP:AGF.

I don't appreciate your abusive language like """"pathetic"""", and it's quite inappropriate of you to take something as incredibly minor as a temporary decline (and the vast majority of article drafts get several declines and improvements before being published, it's not some binary """"amazing""""/""""terrible"""" judgment for eternity). And it is quite overblown to feel slighted by a rejection and instantly leap to railing against the gods, accusing other people of being """"pathetic"""" and lambasting the Wikipedia project, which you were evidently quite interested in contributing to prior to receiving even the slightest constructive criticism.

I said clearly """"from their understanding, rightly or wrongly, from verses in the Bible, they arive at the date and believe to be the historical"""" date.   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical"""", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That's not what I meant.    As far as the """"theological reasons"""" the point too is why would they be so """"vested"""" if they didn't believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It's all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was """"587"""" instead of """"607"""" (according to the whole """"2520 years"""" view, which I know you don't believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we'd still be living in the """"last days"""" anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the """"end times"""" if that's the case.

You were not sure what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical date"""" not just solely """"theological"""".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.

I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they """"mis-translated"""" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say """"I begin"""" or """"I am beginning"""" it does NOT say what you said of """"already beginning"""".

Whether you use the word """"beginning"""" or """"start"""".   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are """"already beginning"""" or """"first"""" or """"starting off"""".   Because if it's """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.

-Stephen went to Christ Church Grammer School until 1962 when his family moved to Melbourne. There he attended Brighton Grammer School from 1963 to 1969. In 1970 he attended Melbourne High School and received a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Melbourne University to complete a Law Degree. Instead his father John Hastings Carew-Reid talked him into comming back to Perth WA and taking over the family stone business and completing a Bachelor of Commerce Degree during the years 1971-75. Stephen received 75% of the family company worth about $8,000 in compensation to his other two brothers and one sister receiving about $20,000 to start their adult life with. Stephen built this company up with wise real estate investments from $8,000 in value to over $500,000 by the end of the 1970's. Stephen wanted to develop these properties himself and make a further $1 million development profit by building town houses and offices on the land. During his university days he rented all the rooms out in the houses to pay for the mortgages, had two children and was one of the 8 selected out of over 2,000 entries to fly to Melbourne to be part of the Johny Young Song Festival. His father took control of the company back from Stephen by issuing an extra 5,000 shares now it was very valuable and stopped Stephen from developing the house himself and in fact sold the house to a property developer who made $1 million profit. His father died in 1986 and left the WA Public Trustee as executor of this will. Stephen ended up sueing the Public Trustee for mishandling the etate and ended up representing himself for over a decade in the WA Courts against the Public Trustee who used their power of City Hall against him. Stephen has ended up having his practical expereince in the courts before he did any formal training and has now written a series of books about the fight he has had with the WA Public Trustee and the WA Government called, The Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching the Watchers). The books have been named after his late Great Grand Father, Sir Edgar Bertram McKennal who was well known bronze sculpter in the earty 1900's in Melbourne who went on to becoming quite famous in Europe.

In Ancient Rome, a sponge on a stick was commonly used, and, after usage, placed back in a bucket of saltwater. Several talmudic sources indicating ancient Jewish practice refer to the use of small pebbles, often carried in a special bag, and also to the use of dry grass and of the smooth edges of broken pottery jugs (e.g., Shabbat 81a, 82a, Yevamot 59b).

Pressure

A source is being mis-used where there is a statement that says the fringe media pressured these various agencies to respond.   

Entry says:Because of the popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many enquiries from people demanding an explanation.[1][3]

I think it is dubious and the source does not mention popularity as the cause for this pressure nor do these vague inquires seem to be specific incident complaints of the type these agencies investigate. This would require times, dates, locations, to proof of an incident much less any """"suspect"""" worthy of investigation by the responding agencies.  One caveat is that these are alleged to be CBW issues and an environmental agency, space agency, or weather agency, or FAA would not even be the primary agency to respond, In my opinion, they might be notified or have something forwarded to them if only to answer questions that they might receive.  After enough questions they made fact sheets.  Were the fact sheets released solely because the theory is popular or because of the exasperating questions?  It should worded better. example below:.

"THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE DELETED!!! 

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own. 

Hey - I can play Hungarian Rhapsody... can I have a page???",1

The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""

If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and """"Ariana"""" for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines """"Ariana Airlines"""".

I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:
1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  

2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of """"Iran Vij"""" which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.

3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as """"Aria"""" in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with """"Aryan"""" and others picked it up.)

4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called """"Ariana"""".

5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called """"Ariana"""" or """"Aryana"""".  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the """"official afghanis website says so"""" you only show how weak your argument is.

5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan""""  well, that is not good enough.

Chronographos, look above, I stated that the Arvanites, in similar with the Vlach, have developed a strong sense of Greek national identity. My concern in these situations is to make sure the close historical/linguistic links are made clear; in the articles, I do not get involved with the modern scene or how the people identify themselves (how people identify themselves is extremely subjective and arbitrary and does not necessarily reflect the historical realities of a situation). And please, don't peronal attack me it is against the Wikipedias rules. Those who personal attack, like you do, calling me terrorist sympathiser, get punished with temporary or perament banning.  
You do like threatening users, don't you?  Except that I will not be intimidated.  You wrote in Wikipedia that there is an Albanian guerilla """"Liberation Army"""" operating in Greece: a patent and outrageous falsehood.  When called to disclose your feelings about such terrorist groups, you refused, calling it a """"secret"""".

Question for Bratsche
If this discussion is to lead anywhere, you will have to formulate the specific, individual questions that need to be answered.   

 Albanau 

It has come to my attention that  has been actively promoting the existence of a """"Çamëria Liberation Army"""" on the Swedish Wikipedia,, identifying it and the more notorious UÇK of Kosovo with a struggle for """"human rights"""". This blatant promotion of armed Albanian extremist groups was later removed by another editor, but Albanau persisted, describing their actions as a reaction to """"cultural oppression"""". This reference too was later deleted as """"redundant propaganda"""". The existence of a such a group in Greece is in fact a matter of speculation, as later acknowledged by a fellow Albanian editor, and there is no reference to such a group on the English Wikipedia. Albanau's views appear to represent a particular mindset, intolerant of anyone or anything not towing the pan-Albanian extremist line, and we should exercise the utmost caution when reading anything signed by him. 
Oh, a terrorist sympathizer with a """"NPOV""""!  How very interesting!

 Here is a little something that I came up with myself

Let the boxes equal the letters A-V
Let the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn't matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])
Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).
This occurs is (1/22) cases.
(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)

If you don't pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:

(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). 

This can be re-written as:

(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).

There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don't multiply by 1/2, because you don't need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.

The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524
This occurs is 21/22 cases so:

(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)

Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn't pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46",0

New sub-catagory

I wanted to add something about the “Persian or Farsi” controversy, but first wanted to consult everyone on this. Let’s talk about both, the pros and the cons, and keep it impartial. There are valuable issues raised by renowned Persian scholars. I quote from an article on the same subject:

→ Identity Aspect: The word Persian in the mind of an English speaker, consciously or not, recalls many other historical and cultural legacies about Iran. Persian is closely associated with Persian poetry, Persian carpets/rugs, Persian cats, Persian poetry, Persian pistachios, and so on. When you refer to this language as Persian, the audience may associate it with one or more of these relevant ideas. On the contrary, the word Farsi not only voids these historical and cultural associations, but it also adds to the recent portrayal of Iran as a strange and distant society.

→ Calling Persian as Farsi, is as incorrect as calling the Persian Gulf as the Farsi Gulf. Moreover, the name Farsi is obscure and under the best conditions refers only to certain dialects such as the Persian of Iran as opposed to Tajiki, the Persian of Tajikistan or Dari, the Persian of Afghanistan, or even one may say Isfahani, the Persian of Isfahan. 

→ The use of word Farsi in English strikes a discordant tone to the native speaker. Imagine someone speaking in English about their recent trip to Paris saying, """"I went to Paris and there I spoke Francais."""" (Instead of saying French). To use the word Farsi has the same impact and may sound not only pretentious at times but also destructive of English syntax.

We should therefore avoid the use of the word Farsi instead of Persian because it not only violates historical fact but also some of the regularities of the language in which we speak. I believe that Persian is the true and proper name of this language in foreign tongues and international communities and changing it does not benefit the representation of Iranian culture.""",0

The restored wording seems over-simplified.  It ignores the Council's attribution to the college of the bishops of the same powers that it attributes also to the Pope alone.  The Pope has within the college or body of the bishops a position analogous to that which Peter had within the college or body of the apostles.  It was to the college or body of the apostles, with Peter as its head, that Christ gave authority over the Church.  It is the college or body of the bishops, with the Pope as its head, that has succeeded to that authority.  Schreck does not deny this.  The Pope's position needs to be mentioned, but the position of the bishops as a body must also be mentioned.    
Thank you for your comments. Do you have a reference for your position above? I just want the article to be factually correct so I am using the information provided in the Nihil obstat Imprimatur declared source by Prof. Alan Schreck which states on page 159 (author cites Lumen Gentium 22 and Catechism para 882 for the following): """"For the Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered."""" That seems pretty clear to me and supports the article text in the lead describing him as the leader of the church. The information about the college of bishops is discussed the section entitled Teaching Authority. I think that info is too detailed for the lead especially since that power is confined to defining doctrine.   '''talk """,0
"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.",0

We welcome any papers, articles, data, book reviews, historical papers and articles, pictures from the glorious past and the loving present, and thought provoking thesis on Pakistan to be published on the  website
PMC and its Editors reserve the right to accept or reject any material without any explanation.

Does not appear to be meeting the criteria elucidated at WP:RS.  looks like they accept only articles which talk about the glorious past and the loving present of Pakistan and discount what is said in the 'mainstream media' and in 'publications from respected policy analysts' reject other material without any explanation.  hardly the qualities WP requires of RS.

 David Yates and Harry Potter film series

Below is the article as of now between quotes, and my comments

""""Jack Sarfatti

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Jack Sarfatti (born September 14, 1939) is a physicist, known for his Internet writings and Usenet postings explaining his theories. His reputation for holding controversial and non-mainstream views extends back to the 1970s.

Some of his wide-ranging views have included speculations of UFOs as extraterrestrials; the idea that some parapsychological phenomena are real; speculations that faster-than-light communication is possible; and most recently his design for space travel by warping spacetime in the region of the vehicle using dark energy / Josephson junction techniques, a form of """"metric engineering"""".

He also claims to have originated the idea of supersolids.""""

The above sentence should be changed to

He also claims to have originated the idea of recently observed supersolids in 1969 in the paper """"Destruction of Superflow in Unsaturated 4He Films and the Prediction of a New Crystalline Phase of 4He with Bose-Einstein Condensation"""" in Physics Letters, Vol 30A, number 5, 3,, November, 1969 p.300.

The following eminent physicists testified to this claim.

George Chapline, Jr. Lawrence Livermore Laboratory wrote on Feb 16, 2005

""""Jack, Your solid He4 superfluid paper is wonderful! You actually did something once of very great importance - and apparently you did not realize this. This paper is a precursor to quantum gravity, and much more important in that regard than string theory (you can quote me). George"""" 

David Finkelstein wrote on March 26, 2005. 

""""Dear Jack: Congratulations! What greater pleasure can a physicist have than see a long range prediction finally come true. David"""" 

In addition Leonard Susskind of Stanford University Physics Department wrote on Dec 31,2004:

""""To whom it may concern, The Glogower Susskind paper of 1963 which introduced phase operators for a quantum oscillator was in direct response to discussions between Glogower, Susskind, and Jack Sarfatti. Sarfatti's contributions were significant. The correct attribution should be to the 'Glogower, Sarfatti, Susskind' operators. Sincerely, Leonard Susskind""""

Education

Sarfatti earned an undergraduate degree from Cornell University in 1960, where he wrote an honors thesis under the guidance of Hans Bethe. He went on to earn a Master's degree from UCSD in 1967, and a Ph.D. from UCR in 1969, writing a thesis under the direction of Fred Cummings. He taught at San Diego State and studied as a research fellow under David Bohm at the University of London before venturing into non-academic pursuits.

[edit]
This part

""""Involvement with paraphysics

On 21 June 1974 Sarfatti observed alleged psychic Uri Geller, and reported that Geller demonstrated genuine """"psychoenergetic"""" ability at Birbeck beyond the doubt of any reasonable man, under relatively well-controlled and repeatable experimental conditions. (Science News, vol. 106; 20 July 1974; page 46). He later revised this opinion after discussing the matter with James Randi. He wrote in a letter, """"On the basis of further experience in the art of conjuring, I wish to retract my endorsement of Uri Geller's psychoenergetic authenticity."""" (Science News, 6 December 1975, page 355).""""

"""WJ didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on """"We've Had Enough"""" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support an entire family - not just those three children who aren't his biologically. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, """"Dangerous"""", and it was all crap. 99% of Jackson's few remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album were crap, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Blood on the Dance Floor sold an incredibly low 6 million and it was rubbish. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, as many unfortunates found out. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire that disgusting pervert. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's mentally ill fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's career finished a decade ago. ( )

I ask you—what is a 'fact'? It is something that we can prove to be true. How do we prove it to be true? With reliable, verifiable sources. And what do those reliable, verifiable sources say? That Alonso has an existing contract with Ferrari and that he is considering his options for 2015.

You want to remove Alonso from the table so that the article is representative of reality. If so, that change will need to be supported by a reliable, verifiable source in which Alonso himself says that he will leave Ferrari; alternatively, you can find a source from a senior Ferrari figure—be it Marco Mattiachi or Sergio Marchionne—saying the same thing. To change it prematurely suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of key Wikipedia policies, including no crystal balling, no original research and the need for sources that are reliable and verifiable.

I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed """"unsourcedness"""", managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.  I will strive, as always, to avoid personal attacks.  I am sure that, on occasion, my emotions will get the better of me and I will screw up.  If you are concerned about such further instances, feel free to report me to the proper authorities, or what not.  I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   """,0

I appreciate this.  I reverted  with just that 1 sentence 1 source addition.  I then requested to discuss it at the Talk page.  Question  So should I have first discussed it at the Talk page, and then asked it was acceptable for the article?  I thought on wikipedia I'm free to add something, and then discuss it.  Also, they reverted me.  I added the simple 1 sentence, and they reverted me 5+ times.  I'm not sure why the focus is on me warring with them, because they reverted me.  Could you clarify this?  Again, I added the simple sentence and national source (Outside Magazine) and I then asked to discuss it, and they reverted it 5+ times.  MONGO cited reasons such as the person is deceased, that the person took """"only 1 pill"""" of the prescription steroid (Outside article is on the use of steroids for performance enhancing on Everest), he commented in the Talk section that I should not be against the mountaineer, etc.  These all seem very unacceptable.  Highly biased journalism.  Almost laughably so.  And he didn't care to discuss it.  Fact:  The climber was reveled by Outside to have taken it, the Outside article is on """"Climbers Little Helper"""", subtitled """"a dangerous trend in mountaineering: rampant use of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly the powerful steroid dexamethasone.""""

If such a simple, factual addition causes this horrible upheaval on wikipedia, I'm baffled.
Also, MONGO followed me to 3 totally unrelated articles.  Clearly he was following/stalking me, rather than editing articles he is interested in.  And, he got away with it, even with administrators who laughed with him about it all.  They do derisory posts, give each other barnsters, and laugh about their control over a novice wikipedia user.

 The VERY Naive Perspective 

This was stated:

'There was no implication that ALL VNR's are propaganda.  If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda, which I infer is undisputed, then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral.'

Separated into two concepts: 
a) that """"There was no implication that ALL VNRs are propaganda."""" 
-and-
b) """"If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda ... then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral."""" 

In regards to the first:-
A Video """"News"""" Release by the government, which is ( as they, a priori, are ) intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is, by definition, propaganda.
In regards to the second:-
Is the statement that the labeling of VNR's is an ideologically neutral act?  It would not be, as, through labeling it, one is categorizing it ideologically. 

Please do not misunderstand, IMHO VNR's are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea """"The Fish do not see the Water"""". In Communication Studies, Propaganda Studies, even Neuro-Linguistic Programming NLP( which, while it is a controversial system, is based on common-sense """"slight of mind"""" techniques.) the Sandwich Formula of:
/true statement -> statement intended to be perceived as true -> true statement/
is being used here. Example: 6 o'clock news, tired Americans sit down to eat and watch the news. In the middle of verifiable and true information segments a VNR is placed, so the end effect of 'Rain tomorrow //-> VNR Information //-> Gas is up by 1 cent' is to believe 3 new facts, not 2 and one to question.

Neutrality tag
The tagged section is not only neutral, it is primary verification of what JfJ claim to believe. It would be very odd indeed if the communism article did not reference communist sources for what communists believe. The section states what JfJ believe, it makes no claims about what Wiki believes, nor what the editor who put it there believes, nor what a reader should believe. It is therefore an verifiable NPOV reporting of a group that is itself obviously not neutral. My reading of this article is that although technically neutral in its presentation, it starts by presenting all the negative views of JfJ. That does not seem logical. A neutral reader wants to know firstly what JfJ believe, then what others say, neutral, pro and con. Example:
Jane Doe's netball team's mission statement says, """"Play quality netball ...""""
The Netball League recently described the team as """"dedicated, but lacking experience""""

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0

“Clitoridectomy is a technique long eschewed owing to poor cosmetic outcomes and significant damage to sexual sensation and function.

"I am really puzzled by the confusion that remains here. First, people need to know that the term prophet is used in two ways by the LDS. In essence, any individual who is given revelation which is pertinent to the future is acting prophetically. Thus, any individual (in or out of the Church) might prophecy and thereby be referred to as a small-'p' prophet. However, some individuals are formally ordained (by laying on of hands) as Prophets, Seers, and Revelators. Thus, Brother Jones may be a Bishop, a High Priest, an Apostle, and a Prophet at the same time (we actually have 15 prophets if you wish to pursue the issue). Unique to the LDS belief is the understanding that the authority of Priesthood offices are retained, based on worthiness, forever. So while Joseph Smith acted prophetically, he also held the titles of, Elder, Apostle, Prophet, President, and High Priest. It could also be said he was a Deacon, a Teacher, and a Priest. These are titles. In fact, broken down by office and (common usage)

Aaronic (preparatory) Priesthood
Deacon (Brother Jones) 
Teacher (Brother Jones)
Priest (Brother Jones)
Bishop (Bishop Jones)

Melchizidek Priesthood 
Elder (Elder Jones)
Seventy (Elder Jones)
High Priest (Brother Jones)
Patriarch (Formerly Patriarch Jones, new policy recommends Brother Jones) 
Apostle (senior Quorum member designated Prophet, or President Jones)

 

Consider this fact. Joseph Smith's father served for years as the Patriarch of the Church. While he was a patriarch (speaking of his role as a father) it would sound silly to state that Joseph Smith Sr. was the (small 'p') patriarch of the church.

Joseph Smith, while a 'p'rophet, was also a 'P'rophet by virtue of Priesthood office. Thus Pope John Paul, President Obama, Prophet Smith (though the term President Smith is more commonly used). So feel free to refuse to identify Joseph Smith as a 'p'rophet. But it is insensitive to both the RLDS and the LDS and erroneous to ignore the fact Joseph Smith was a 'P'rophet (an office in the High Priesthood). I don't follow the Pope, but I wouldn't deny he is one. You don't have to believe Smith was a prophet, to accept he was a Prophet in the LDS Priesthood.",0

 Why Two Pages? 

Now, I'm not an """"authority"""" such as people here claim to be. I don't hold any PhDs, nor do I feel I posses a """"body of knowledge"""" that """"is very likely to dismiss...innocent guesses, or fractal knowledge.""""  I have, however, spent some time in Russia and in Kazakhstan, specifically Almaty. That is the name I always hear people use - Almaty. The Russians, however, still call it Alma-Ata. For example, I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile, and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty. All the people I met in Almaty, however, say Almaty. When I see the name written on signs and billboards in the city, it is also written as """"Алматы"""" (Almaty). 

From my experience, only the Russians continue the use of Alma-Ata. As another example, the train station in Moscow says Алма-Ата (Alma-Ata). However, it also says Gorki instead of Nizhny Novgorod (most everyone there says Nizhny Novgorod, or """"Nizhny"""" for short - I can't recall actually hearing """"Gorki"""" used beyond the train station).

Also, It's not just the Kazakh government who uses that name - it's a lot of people. Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty (they sometimes mention """"the Soviet Alma-Ata"""", much like Bishkek is the """"Soviet Frunze"""". 

As for using the scientific/scholarly-approved approach for naming, Wikipedia doesn't do that (as mentioned above). See, the """"scientific"""" or """"academic"""" method for writing the offical name of the country - Қазақстан - is actually Qazaqstan (the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English). There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a """"K""""  - including Wikipedia. If people say we should use """"Alma-Ata"""" because it's the correct name as dictated by academics, why no Qazaqstan?  

Anyway, my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles (Almaty and Alma-Ata). I think there should only be one, since regardless of the name it is still the same place. All the pictures and information should be seen together, on one page. They should be merged. 

Oh, one more thing. I just went to Google and looked up """"Алматы"""" (Almaty) - 4,270,000 hits. I then looked up """"Алма–Ата"""" (Alma-Ata) - only 1,160,000.""",0

The article states at Iranian calendar#Modern era from 1925 that in 1976, the Shah decreed that Solar Hejri year 1355 became the imperial year 2535.

This would be even more arbitrary then the beginning of his reign, which is a well known year. His birth year is assigned to be two different years, either 600–599 BC or 576–575 BC. 

Regarding Nowruz, in Achaemenid times the official year began at Nowruz at the vernal equinox, but popular usage placed Nowruz at the summer solstice.

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

But the other judges typically don't scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line; there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier—sometimes even within the same case. Unanimous opinions (where every judge signs) are different, and they reflect a higher level of collaboration, as in Brown v. Board of Education. 

The bottom line is that the source itself doesn't say who wrote it. The commentators on BLP/N seem to think this is an important distinction.  Luke """,0

Well, there was a hot war going on in the background of TYOLD (the Konfrontasi) - the whole """"Living Dangerously"""" line was based around Sukarno's words ushering in of hot conflict against Malaysia, UK, etc. But on the point of Indonesian Civil War - at least at the beginning of '65, there was indeed some combat between the """"G30S"""" forces and those loyal to Suharto.

"Instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS.

WHY the King JAMES ONLY MOVEMENT rejects modern translations

Here is what was written:

""""In the modern period, the King-James-Only movement is opposed to new translations precisely because they're officially-endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations"""".

reply:
You would have to prove that. You would have to show direct quotes, direct cause and effect between the 1. rejection by KJVO (Abreviated as KJVO on this page for the sake of brevity) of the modern versions 2. their own explanations of their rejections of modern versions BECAUSE they are officially endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations. 

However, even if you could find such explanations in passing, the reason why KJVOs reject Modern versions is because the Modern Versions are innacurate, NOT because the official versions are endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations. Most KJVOs would not care who endorsed a particular version, if their own conclusions were that the Version in question were accurate. Therefore to suggest that

""""In the modern period, the King-James-Only movement is opposed to new translations precisely because they're officially-endorsed by """"mainstream"""" Protestant denominations"""".

implies a cause and effect relationship between the conclusions of the KJVOs and the basis upon which that reasoning was made, which is faulty. Theo5""",0

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

P.S. In response to 'canvassing': I think such accusations are, once again, biased. We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it, but nothing happens, because she is supporting the status quo. Canvassing for the status quo=acceptable. Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I'm being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn't know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field. Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia, but society itself.

Finally again, FYO I am more than two, but slightly less than three, standard deviations above the 'average' IQ, and therefore I see fit to say that I, like Michael C Price, and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society. Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average, we can still see the groundwork of 'one' order of magnitude higher. Of course, an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user, so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system, which I see as having quite many flaws. I do hope that these types of 'essays' will lead to 'constructive' improvements in the future.

"""==This User's Abuse of his Admin status, deliberate posting of proven misinformation==

According to WP:LINKSTOAVOID article 2: """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" cannot be included in wikipedia.  has purposefully breached this policy in his continuing personal vendetta against me. Here is the proof:

After repeatedly being warned by myself against the misleading and factually inaccurate material presented on an external webpage Janet Marlow's site admin  still intentionally linked to this misinformative page in the following edit: 

 

 has since made the (above) statement: """"there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked. Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings. Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue.""""

Not only is  mistaken in claiming that there is no misinformation on the page, or that the two sides in the argument are describing the same thing, he has clearly been abusing his status as an administrator. Let us first consider the contents of this argument:

The page to which  linked makes the following claims:

""""Therefore, there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar. If you play a C,  Bb, Ab, and Gb on the first string E,  there will be less sustain from these notes than the others because there are no sympathetic resonant strings. This was Maestro Yepes’ primary reason for conceiving the ten-string guitar. By adding these pitches in four extra bass strings, now provides each half step with the sympathetic resonance making a more physically completed instrument."""" (Janet Marlow Janet Marlow's site)

Now, in western classical music there are 12 notes in the octave: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. If it is claimed (as above) that four of these notes lack resonances, then logically/mathematically, this means that the other eight out of the twelve do not lack resonances. Marlow lists the four missing resonances as C, Bb (=A#), Ab (=G#), and Gb (=F#) and states that """"there will be less sustain from these notes than the others"""". Any person who is a competent speaker of the English language will understand this as meaning that these four listed notes have more sustain (more resonance) than the other notes, the """"other notes"""" being C#, D, D#, E, F, G, A, B. In other words, Marlow is claiming four notes don't have resonance and eight do.

However, Narciso Yepes (who invented the modern 10-string guitar) always, ubiquitously and verifiably talked about eight missing sympathetic resonances on the guitar, not four as claimed by Marlow. Yepes lists the eight missing resonances as C, C# (=Db), D# (=Eb), F, F# (=Gb), G, G# (=Ab), A# (=Bb). He lists the other four notes that do have resonance as D, A, E, and B. Yepes's quotes from numerous articles/interviews can be read here  with references to follow them up. There is also further information on my site www.tenstringguitar.INFO about the acoustics, the science behind Yepes's statements.

Janet Marlow (and ) are clearly, in fact, not saying the same thing as Narciso Yepes (and Viktor van Niekerk). Both sides are certainly not """"describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings"""", as  is falsely claiming. If they were describing the same thing, Marlow would have to speak of eight missing resonances (C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, G, Ab, Bb) not only four (C, Bb, Ab, Gb).

 only goes on to claim that """"Whether that is four """"resonances"""" or eight is a non-issue"""" because to admit the truth - that it is very much an issue and a source of misinformation - would reveal his involvement in not only deliberately promoting misinformation on wikipedia (going against WP:LINKSTOAVOID article 2), but also misusing his status as an administrator to abuse me in his ongoing personal vendetta over an edit disagreement. This defamatory conduct includes, but is hardly limited to his claim (below) that Janet Marlow """"is a more authoritative figure than Viktor"""", despite the fact that Marlow has been proven to publish misinformation while my website www.tenstringguitar.INFO is presently the only online resource that faithfully represents Narciso Yepes's statements about his invention as well as a scholarly explanation of the",0
"Incompleteness 
As I heard the story of the Carson City Mint, it started life as a private operation, because the US Treasury refused to build a branch to accommodate the Comstock Lode.  When the government attempted to close it down and prosecute the operators for counterfeiting, the prosecution was defeated by the detail that the dollar coins were fractionally overweight.  The street price of silver in Carson City was low enough to still permit a profit on the minting. Thus, unable to prevent the minting of silver coins in Carson City, the Treasury took over operations and pocketed the fractional overweight.  Even if this story is inaccurate, I believe the story ought to be included, perhaps with its disproof, but it does shed light on the issue of the discrepancy between the value of silver as a commodity and as currency.",0

But all of this is a distraction from the issue that i was trying to point at: That some of these biographies are being used as a coatrack for describing minority/fringe views, that do not fall under biographic material, and that BLP is used to circumvent NPOV by not describing the mainstream viewpoint.

Unholy alliance
An unholy alliance is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups, especially if one is religious, for ad hoc or hidden gain. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the public interest. An early, well-known use of the term was by Theodore Roosevelt (TR):
TAB 
""""To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."""" - 1912 Progressive Party Platform, attributed to TRO'Toole, Patricia, """"The War of 1912,"""" TIME in Partneship with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006. and quoted again in his autobiographyRoosevelt, Theodore. An Autobiography: XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, NEW YORK: MACMILLAN, 1913. where he connects Trusts and monopolies (sugar interests, Standard Oil, etc.) to Woodrow Wilson, Howard Taft, and consequently both major political parties.
TAB 
After the breakup of Standard Oil, TR lost the election, and the unholy alliance he had identified, oligopolies of a few big commodities corporations and their political allies, continued otherwise undeterred by the mutually beneficial indifference of both major political parties. In 1935, retired Marine Major General Smedley Butler described how this unholy alliance influenced U.S. foreign policy and how his job abroad had been to be a """"muscle man for big business."""" In 1944, conservative journalist John T. Flynn described how this unholy alliance uses religion to sell its agenda abroad to the American public:
TAB 
""""The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of larceny, murder, rapine and barbarism. We are always moving forward with high mission, a destiny imposed by the Deity to regenerate our victims while incidentally capturing their markets, to civilise savage and senile and paranoid peoples while blundering accidentally into their oil wells.""""Flynn, John T. (1944) As We Go Marching. p. 240
TAB 
A reference to this unholy alliance today is:
TAB 
Unholy Alliance, a review by PBS journalist, Rev. Dr. Allen Dwight Callahan of
TAB 
Phillips, Kevin (2006) American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century, Viking Press.

"""==For Dr. Tim Vickers==

Undoubtedly Wikipedia is an important world resource on many topics. Certainly Wikipedia needs to maintain a high quality of references underpinning its articles. That is exactly why the references I have provided in the article must be accepted. They are based on considered conclusions from a wide range of quality sources. They are an accurate reflection of the work of Ed O'Loughlin made by people that know this area. There is no contrary evidence which any editor has brought to light. 
 

Therefore, blocking me (on trumped-up Wikipedia """"charges"""") does not bother me in the least. However, it is a sad reflection on your own processes. Why?

(1) Administrative editors specifically deleted my (concise) position statement in the RfC section and supplanted it with their own statement in an attempt to influence the RfC. These Administrators of Wikipedia were simultaneously advocating a particular viewpoint on O'Loughlin's work, and judging the validly of a contributing editor's references and attempting to silence him.

(2) The repeated deleting by Wikipedia editors of the words """"media monitoring groups"""" and substituting it with the words """"Jewish groups"""" (when they are by no means exclusively Jewish) will be of general wider interest, I think, and may have certain other implications.

(3) The comment by Manning that on advice he would overturn the blockade on me seems itself to have been overturned without explanation and an attempt was made to cover this up. With all the Wikipedia rules and procedures this arbitrary behaviour is rather unsatisfactory.

(4) As a scientist, Dr. Vickers you would realise that in consciously acting as an instrument to suppress knowledge you are acting in a way that must compromise your reputation and makes you vulnerable.

Encyclopaedia Britannica , 15th edition , vol.3

""""Croatia became a kingdom in the 10th century, and in the 1091  Ladislaus I (Laslo I) of Hungary assumed control; the ensuing union with Hungary lasted for 8th centuries. During the union with Hungary, Croatia retained its own assemble, the Sabor,  and was legally an independent kingdom.""""

""""Croatia retained its independence under native kings until 1102, when the crown passed into the hands of the Hungarian dynasty. The precise terms of this relationship later became a matter of dispute; nonetheless, even under dynastic union with Hungary, institutions of separate Croatian statehood were maintained through the Sabor (an assembly of Croatian nobles) and the ban (viceroy). In addition, the Croatian nobles retained their lands and titles. """"

I am an African American currently residing outside of the States.  I just wanted to write and say """"Thanks DeeCee"""", for your work over at the Black Supremacist page.  I surfed there by accident.  I was shocked to find that Wikipedia has even chosen to include this article.  It is far too long in view of the insignificance of so-called """"Black Supremacy"""" when compared to the massive White Supremacist Movement which is once again taking the entire White World by storm.  (Are you a Black Supremacist, if you are only trying to survive in a nation that overtly practices and tolerates Racist practices such a lynching or segregation?)  Until I read our courageous comments, I was truly daunted by the sheer malevolence that appears to be at work in that article, especially the insidious denigrations of Marcus Garvey.  So many considered him to be a hero for addressing Black suffering in the Post Slavery Occident.  Yet, that article slanders him viciously, referring to him as an errand boy of the Klu Klux Klan and a friend of White Supremacists.  I have not been able to find any truth in any of these statements, so I deleted them.  So much of the material there appears to be merely conjectured or anecdotal designed to tell ugly tales about African people in general rather than focus on the purported subject at hand.  Yet, on the White Supremacist page, there are no such juicy tidbits to further incite anger and outrage.  There are no tales told period, just the bare bones concerning this virulent hate-inspired movement.  In fact, much has been left out.  The White Supremacist article could have included a number of recent and not so reccent events that would have turned any reader's stomach but the writer keeps it very cut and dry.  Not so on the Black Supremaciy page where, the author goes out of his way to assasinate the character of any Black person who remotely expresses any racial pride or hope for his people.  I guess, he is just two fingers from calling Martin Luther King a Black Supremacist, since he incited Black people to protest white brutality and segregation.

I want to complain to Wikipedia about the unhealthy tone in which the Black Supremacist page has been written.  The assaults on Rappers and other musicians such as Lauren Hill is shocking.  I have no doubt that the article is motived by racial hate.  It is so apt that you have identified the problems as systemic.  Wikipedia is a true menace in the sense that people of African descent are often assaulted but may lack the resources, time or orientations necessary to defend themselves against those who use Wikipedia to commit what amounts to racial assault.  Refutations are highly resented and a general ambiance of White supremacist aggression reigns on many pages.  I haven't read all that you've written, I imagine that you spend a lot of time, fighting the good fight.  Again thanks.  I hope you get this message.Sincerely

Railway stations of Budapest
Hi,

I've just seen that a few days ago you moved Eastern Railway Station (Budapest) to Budapest keleti pályaudvar (and did the same with the other two railway stations of the city). I don't think this was a good idea, for several reasons:
 English Wikipedia has a policy of using the English names whenever it's possible (Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). An average reader, when looking at the article title, won't know what's this article about, unless they open it and read it. The word pályaudvar will be totally unintelligible for the majority of them.
 You wrote (in the edi summary of the Keleti station) that this was to keep in line with a convention of using original names, but glancing at a few randomly chosen railway station article from non-English-speaking countries it seems that this is not a convention, some of them use English names, some of them don't. (Also, you don't seem consistent since you didn't move the articles of the other Hungarian stations.)
 """"Budapest keleti pályaudvar"""" is incorrect in Hungarian. The city name itself is never a part of the name of railway stations, unless it's the only station of the city. (It's incorrect grammatically too.)

Can we please move back these three articles to their previous names?

I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism: 

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history. This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology, but misleading about other topics as well.

Ismail, as we know, was radically Shiite and claimed descendance from Ali ibn Talib, who wasn't Persian but Arab. Also, the """"royal Persian descent"""" as it's known in times of Safavis was from time of Sassanids, who according to Islam were heretics and Ismail could not have possibly been proud of them.

 semi-protect request 

Do you know how to put in sem-protects? I'd like on on pseudophilosophy and Patrecia Scott as Alienus is using new sockpuppets to edit these. Thanks.  

Hello: this request for semi-protection on two articles is out of process  the user making the request is in a content dispute with multiple editors, and has provided no valid evidence, nor requested Checkuser to support the claim that any banned sockpuppets are editing. Editing from anon-IPs is not reason enough; particularly when the request for semi-protection comes from an editor with a  who wishes to protect his version of the article.Talk 

 Most requests for administrative intervention come from editors with an interest in the topic.  That doesn't invalidate the request, or change the fact that Alienus is not permitted to edit Wikipedia by the order of the Arbcom.  Hope that helps.   
There's been no actual evidence that any vandalism or editing by Alienus has occurred at those articles. Claiming an IP address is a banned user without proof is inappropriate, and contrary to semi-protection policy, which states,

Semi-protection should not be used:

As a preemptive measure against vandalism before any vandalism has occurred.
As a response to regular content disputes, since it may restrict some editors and not others (see the protection policy for how to deal with this).
In the case of a static IP vandal hitting a page (blocking is preferable to semi-protection).
...
To prohibit anonymous editing in general.
Talk 

 I'm pretty satisfied that the thing that is quacking, waddling, and shedding feathers is, in fact, a duck.  
When making a claims contrary to WP:AGF, it might be a good idea to actually have evidence. Can you show any edit in the  recent history of Pseudophilosophy that was either 1) vandalism or 2) an edit by a banned user? Likewise, can you show that in  Patrecia Scott  IPs 207.210.106.104 or  128.197.11.30 are the banned user Alienus, as claimed? All I see is a content dispute, and edit-warring by LaszloWalrus and for that you are not permitted to semi-protect an article. In fact, the content in the latter article that LaszloWalrus keeps removing is in the Nathaniel Branden article: """"In 1968, the close relationship between Rand and Branden came to an abrupt end when Rand discovered that Branden was having a sexual relationship with a third woman, actress Patrecia Scott.

Hi.

I just finished reading your message and before I say anything, there are two things you need to clarify:
Is it an article or a stand-alone list? It can be both, but then it must satisfy the inclusion criteria for both; if I say """"it is overwhelming"""", that'd be a huge understatement. Personally, I think it is a list. I never made the mistake of thinking the only list is a bulleted or numbered list. Tables are, most of the times, lists; comparison tables are always lists.
Do you want to abide by the policies or do you want to ignore them? Make no mistake, I have heard the sentence """"writing a decent article"""" so much that I have no faith in it; if one hundredth of them were true, Wikipedia would have now been full of featured articles. So, I won't hold any value in it unless I see signs of it being true.

That said, yes, arguments like """"but this page is not a list of everything in the universe"""" in response to """"Wikipedia is not a directory of everything in the universe that exists"""" are so childish that I don't even give them the pleasure of handwaving them. And the fact that WP:NOT was once an essay doesn't make me think any less of it, let alone violate it; it is now a fundamental policy, so its original writer has my highest respects for writing such a popular thing. It says we are not a directory and that means a hybrid of directory is not allowed either.

Kgotso, ntate McDonald.

Thanks for your input at the Sesotho talk page. I guess it really does depend on one's experiences but I do believe that there are numerous rational justifications to use the names """"Sesotho"""" and """"Basotho"""" (eg. ambiguity of """"Sotho"""" which could refer to half a dozen different things) but I feel that the most important reason is that one should use the original form of the native name instead of arbitrarily modifying it (especially for a name which is not commonly used by average English speakers).

I am rather intrigued by how you peace corps guys manage to learn these languages so quickly and be able to use them in the countries.

What exactly do the peace corps do, exactly? Judging from the film """"eLollipop"""" it appears that it's mainly an international volunteer organisation that goes to poor countries to attempt to uplift the people at grassroots level  which sounds like a lot of fun (yes, I probably SHOULD take a look at the Wikipedia article and stop asking you this stuff).

"""Please read the following article carefully in order to understand the real world-wide recognised history

Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today’s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE!

 Is User:Irvine22 a disruptive editor? 

There has been a long-standing issue with Irvine22, primarily on the PIRA page, but also on others.  Irvine22 has been confirmed as a puppetmaster for the purposes of block evasion, refused to acknowledge or apologize for the incident, and then began to implement a series of disruptive, POV edits without discussing the matter on the talk page.  His edits have been almost universally reverted, and yet he continues to make them, after being told many times by many editors as well as one admin to raise issues on the talk page first.  He shows no sign of ceasing this behaviour, nor will he acknowledge, much less address, any criticism of it.  The page's resident admin, User:Rd232, suggested that I raise the matter on the ANI page if it continued, so that is what I am doing now.

Following is a small sampling of Irvine22's more recent edits.  Note that I have only selected edits for which there was no consensus, that were later reverted.  These also all occurred after his block and subsequent sockpuppetry.  They also occurred after he was repeatedly told not to edit the article without first seeking consensus, or at the very least providing an adequate source.  

The edits:

  This edit was reverted, and a new section started on the talk page.  Instead of trying to reach a consensus, he restored the edit with the explanation """"per discussion"""".  It was not.

 This POV edit was reverted.  Irvine22 restored it.  It was reverted again.  So he restored it again.  It was reverted again and he was told to bring the matter up on the talk page.  So he restored it again.  And again.  And again.  Actually a quick glance at the page's history will show you the behaviour he regularly partakes in. I really wish I could link to more, but I simply don't have the time.  Rest assured, there are dozens.

Talk page disruption begins here

Irvine22 has also been dismissive of advice and instructions to change his editing habits, as can be seen here, and especially on the PIRA talk page, beginning here.

Note Irvine22's polite yet dismissive tone throughout all of this.  He is almost pathologically incapable of acknowledging any wrongdoing on his part, or criticism of his actions.  I am not sure if this is a deliberate attempt to game, or the result of some actual personality disorder for which he cannot be fully faulted. 

I haven't the time to go digging through his edit history.  I really wish I did.  I will, however, link to this page on the PIRA talk page and invite further comments from the editors there.

Thank you for your time. 

P.S.  I apologize if this request is not in the correct category.  It crosses several, and I didn't want to pigeonhole it as a 3rr issue, as the problem extends far beyond simple edit warring.""",0

A year ago India was scarred by some of the worst sectarian violence since partition, when up to 2,000 Muslims were killed in pogroms in the western state of Gujarat, ostensibly sparked by an arson attack by Muslims on a train that killed 59 Hindu activists. Human rights organisations in India, the US and Europe implicated two organisations in the well-orchestrated attacks, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council) and its youth offshoot, the Bajrang Dal (devotees of the monkey-god Hanuman).

Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad, collected mainly as tax-free charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK. This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny. So it should - as should the links between these groups and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasi-paramilitary body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or Association of National Volunteers), which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP. Described by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, as """"an Indian version of fascism"""", the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations. This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used.

The UK is formally investigating two RSS fundraising affiliates, and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. The US has also started carefully scrutinising RSS front organisations. That probe should go ahead unimpeded by Washington's ambition to develop a strategic alliance with India as a counterbalance to China's weight in Asia.

True. Both libertarians and conservatives in the modern Western world want low taxes, small government and individual freedom and responsibility. However, the difference is that libertarianism is a fixed ideology, while conservatism as an ideology varies between time periods and societies; for instance, nineteenth-century conservatism was about preserving monarchical and aristocratic rule and was totally different from modern conservatism. I think the quote I added to the first paragraph sums that up quite well: """"who are the 'conservatives' in today's Russia?

Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I'm assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won't start an edit war over it! I've never participated in an edit war and I don't intend to start now. —  (comment)  

Actually, I would have preferred just listing """"A planet is officially defined as..."""" but now it has been amended so:
a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandbox
b) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAU
c) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before this
d) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differently
e) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.
I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  

Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  

I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won't object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I've enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  

I'm not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn't intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word """"official"""", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the """"official scientific body"""", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for """"unofficial cultural definitions"""", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put """"Definition"""" and """"Disagreement"""" under the main heading of """"Etymology"""".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)

There were far more massacres in this period than only Menemen, the article dis proportionally ignored the casualties of the Turkish civilians during this war.

Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The """"Allegiance"""" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. 

I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters.

It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign  (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

NPOV
I believe the following assertion belies a non-neutral point of view: """"Two feminist historians, Elizabeth Mason-Hohl and Kate Campbell Hurd-Mead, wrote about Trotula in the 1930s/40s. Both women made false and unsupported elaborations about Trotula’s life, leading to misconceptions that last to this day."""" To call Mason-Hohl and Hurd-Mead's claims """"false and elaborate"""" is groundless, especially given that Hurd-Mead's text is still today one of the most reliable sources for the study of the History of Science.

First of Kamikaze, to be honest this entry has really gone down hill since the last time I left it and it was people like you that put it there. Your so called facts you cling too are mearly third party trash, much of which is little more than fantasy, some of it is such garbage you would have to be an idiot to belive it. If you going to rely on """"documents"""" from third party sites do a little research on the documents, like if its a PDF save it and take a look at the publishers marks on the file, find out what you can. Then look at what a legit document looks like. I see legit Walmart Documents. And if you find that a fact is a fake is it not your job to get rid of it for the good of the entry?

I think you misunderstood me; I did not claim your arguments were """"illegitimate"""" as a whole, merely that they were less legitimate than the others. """"Legitimate"""" was probably the wrong word. You made some good points, but the request's supporters made better ones. Your opposing vote contained the following text:
Furthermore, the reason given for moving is in itself offensive. The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article. In the absence of any evidence that we're bigots, I suggest the correct move is for Laval either to demonstrate we're bigots or to apologize for slandering us.
This violates WP:AGF in the first sentence, and continues to be something akin to a personal attack. I am sure that your comments were sincere, but I think both sides allowed themselves to get riled and to speak too rashly. Your point about original research was more significant, but the term """"Anti-Quebec sentiment"""" does seem to be in fairly widespread use (I did check).
A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state """"Please remember that this survey is not a vote"""", so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and """"Marc Gévry"""" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 """"votes"""" in favour of """"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]"""", and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course).
I don't approve of returning to debates once they've been closed, and I really think you should move on. There is plenty of work to be done to the article, at whatever title it may be, and I'm sure you can contribute a great deal to it. Therefore, I don't wish to discuss this matter any further.

"Melchoir/ Ultra-Space Field Theory 

Hi Sam,

My name is Keith D. Foote. I'm the author of a treatise titled the Ultra-Space Field Theory. Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites. I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir. 

The Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute. 

I would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise. If Melchoir will e-mail me a snail mail address, I would be happy to send him a copy.

I can be reached at patienthunter@netscape.net

Thanks,

Sincerely,

First off let's be clear, this is a proposed merger not a deletion. Looking at your argument of other stuff exists, the only HD specific example that you have mentioned (List of DirecTV local channels with HD) compares the availability of affiliated HD channels between cities, not a million miles away from this page comparing channel availability between platforms. The other examples that you have given are lists per platform, as you said. The fact is HD channels on Sky do form a part of Sky Digital and not another platform called Sky+ HD, HD channels are clearly labelled on List of channels on Sky Digital as being in HD were applicable. There is absolutely no distinction in the amount of HD content shown, if it simulcasts with an SD channel etc. on the same channel between platforms. There is no need for a list of channels in a certain broadcast format on a certain platform and it seems like content forking and listcruft. You also mentioned size, labelling this page as potentially """"unwieldy"""", there are clear guidelines for the size of articles and compared to the other lists that you mentioned, this page could double in size without problems. If you want to talk long term, then in the future it's likely that being in HD or knowing if a channel uses up-scaling won't be especially notable just as being in 16:9 or using widescreen switching or stretching/zooming isn't today and at some point this page could also end up being merged or otherwise. By the way, there is a List of television stations in the United Kingdom (foreign versions may be found at Lists of television channels) and I agree that it is somewhat impractical for certain tasks.

"This is a question best raised on the NoScript support forums. However, I can comment on a few of the differences:
 CSP is server-side (has to be configured at each server, sends reports to the server), while ABE is client-side (configured in browser, logs results in error console).
 CSP just allows or blocks content, whereas ABE can take other actions like stripping authentication.
 CSP was primarily designed to stop cross-site scripting and other injections, while ABE was primarily designed to stop cross-site request forgery (but can defeat XSS/injections too).
 CSP allows wildcards, ABE allows either wildcards or regular expressions.
 CSP specifies only hostnames, ABE can specify full addresses including protocol and path.
 ABE knows about intranet vs internet addresses and can control traffic between them (in fact, it does this by default).
 CSP doesn't try to control requests originating from privileged code eg browser extensions. ABE can, although it is always possible for privileged code to defeat this, so it cannot be relied on to protect against malicious addons.
 ABE can distinguish between different types of object inclusions and different HTTP methods.
 They can work independently; if either blocks something, it will be blocked.
 I don't know of any metrics on how widely CSP is deployed, nor do I have any idea how many NoScript users take the time to configure ABE (which doesn't do very much out-of-the-box).",0

 hello 

I don't know what you have against me.  I suppose it is easy to be cold and harsh over a keyboard/monitor.  I never wanted anything but cultural fairness on these pages and compromise.  The aggressiveness and one sided-ness of people like Gryffindor and noclador has always been offensive to me, what can I say?  At least some of you German speakers have to realize that by moving the Province of Bolzano-Bozen to just South Tyrol on English Wikipedia is just emphasizing a German point of view, and only a German point of view.  You really can not say that South Tyrol is the major English usage.  It just isn't.  Alto Adige is also used very often, in the Unites States, almost entirely.  The name of the page itself is taken from Brittanica.  Even on the Bolzano provincial website, one of the English documents says Province of Bolzano.  Look, you guys can do anything you want.  If you change it to South Tyrol, I hope it really makes all of you finally happy with your lives.  I actually feel very sorry to see people in Europe still get so deeply ingrained in these ethnic politics.  The attitude and aggressive behavior I see coming from German speakers, especially German speakers in BZ reminds me more of what you see in Yugoslavia.  It really isn't that far from the """"we are victims"""" attitude before the World Wars. I'm sorry if that is being blunt...""",0

Speedy deletion of Spunga
 A tag has been placed on Spunga, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Representatives of Hinduism held a variety of views on Muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the Narashansrishi of the Vedas, predicted in the Atharva Veda.[183] One of the prominent Vaishnava proponents, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",0

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

"""""""Undoubtedly it will be found at the end of the day that drugs featured in her death as they did in the death of poor Daniel""""

Scott Fri, Feb. 09, 2007

Break-In

Please take notice that less than 24 hours after Anna Nicole's death, Anna Nicole's house was broken into and all of her personal items were stolen.

""""Despite an existing injunction from the Bahamas Supreme Court enjoining G. BEN THOMPSON and his agents from entering the property that was clearly posted on all entrances, persons purporting to act on Mr. Thompson's behalf, including STANCIL [FORD] SHELLY, and others believed to be GINA SHELLY, GAITHER BEN THOMPSON II, MELANIE THOMPSON, and TRACY FERGUSON [Anna Nicole's former lawyer], entered the house without consent and then the locks were changed. Certain of these individuals were also observed removing numerous items from the premises.

""""Upon becoming aware of these activities, lawyers representing Anna Nicole's interests obtained another injunction from the Bahamas Supreme Court, and subsequently reacquired possession of [the house] with the aid of the Bahamas Royal Police Force.

""""When Howard Stern returned to the house a day later, he learned that ALL of Anna Nicole's personal items had been stolen. These items included computers, external hard drives, mini-DV tapes, and DVDs containing all of Anna Nicole's personal digital photos and digital home videos, many of which are extraordinarily personal in nature, and a DVD of Anna Nicole's most recent movie 'Illegal Aliens' that has yet to be released in theatres. All of Anna Nicole's personal documents were also stolen, including confidential contracts, banking information, attorney-client privileged documents, and Dannielynn's birth certificate. Even paintings hanging in the nursery that Anna Nicole had painted for Dannielynn were stolen.

""""Howard Stern also found a piece of paper pinned to a lamp with the names and phone numbers of Gina and Ford Shelly, and Melanie and Gaither Ben Thompson, II.

""""Lawyers representing Anna Nicole's interests are currently working with authorities in the Bahamas and the United States to prosecute all culpable individuals to the fullest extent of the law, to prevent the dissemination of any illegally obtained material, and to secure the return of all of the stolen items.

""""Any individual, firm or entity that uses, reproduces and/or otherwise disseminates any item of personal property of Anna Nicole and/or her estate without the prior written consent of Ron Rale will be held liable to the fullest extent of the law.""""

Daniel, what I have tried to explain here is that there is a confusion between """"Roman Style"""" The refined Classical style of Ancient Rome, and """"Romanesque Style"""" the much less refined style that spread across Europe in the 10th- 12th centuries, an is strongly associated with large, organised Monastries like that at Cluny in France. 
This building is not Romanesque. It is Classical. Now I have looked a more pictures I see that it is clearly an """"Ancient Roman"""" style building. That is why it uses the word """"Roman"""" rather than just saying """"Classical"""". (A Classical Revival building might look like an Ancient Greek building and not like a Roman one.) 

What I'm telling you is that your church is based on the buildings in the top line of the gallery. It is in the same style as the Classical Revival buildings in the middle line of the gallery. It has almost nothing to do with the Romanesque buildings in the bottom line of the gallery.

 Further response.... 

Mr. Galal, you seem, perhaps, frustrated. This is understandable, since you work for Medcan and you surely want the Wikipedia article to include only promotional information. However, Wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth. 
- If wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth, then you should say that even though the Danish Meta Study brings up valid arguments regarding physical examinations and their impact on health outcomes, generally speaking physical examinations are widely accepted and useful healthcare screening tools. I suspect every first world country recommends medicals with a General Practitioner - your comment is stating that these countries health organizations and policy makers are incorrect. And that medicals schools are also incorrect in their lessons.  And we may as well change how medicine is practiced and treat people when they get sick, not try to catch disease early.

The meta-study itself is fairly recent (just two years old). It was brought to us thanks to the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration. I see no reason why a Danish meta-study would be inapplicable to Canada, though you are welcome to try to convince me otherwise.

I won't dispute your point that most people in First World countries undergo routine physical examinations. And I won't dispute that they are customary. But have they been proven to be useful? Not to my knowledge.
- This is an astonishingly closed minded comment.  Medcan alone has hundreds of cases where we've saved peoples lives, improved there lives, provided them insight for future care, etc.  The word """"useful"""" is vague - useful as in leading a healthier life?  Absolutely.  Useful as in keeping someone alive who has a terminal illness - probably not.

I think there is more than enough here for you to understand why we have such an issue with this comment on the Medcan wikipedia page.  If this was an Encyclopedia - there is not a chance it would be posted.  There is no facts or evidence that the Danish study is 100% true - and Medcan's model of care is not just to diagnose, but to also help people through lifestyle modifcation and coaching.""",0

the opening paragraph says unequivocally that Newton discovered calculus in this early notes years before Leibniz, however, this is not a solid historical fact in my opinion. This is based on the reports of newton's own inner circle who claimed that Newton showed the calculus to them. These very men had obviously taken Newton's side in a bitter debate that had seen Newton actively try to obfuscate the issue. Newton even anonymously wrote the concluding remarks in the report by his own Royal Society whihc claimed Leibniz a fraud and Newton the true discoverer. It should be added to the opening paragraph that the dates of Newton's first use of the calculus are based on the witness accounts of Newton's close confidants.",0

At night, transpiration usually does not occur because most plants have their stomata closed. When there is a high soil moisture level, water will enter plant roots, because the water potential of the roots is lower than in the soil solution. The water will accumulate in the plant creating a slight root pressure. The root pressure forces some water to exude through special leaf tip or edge structures, hydathodes, forming drops. Guttation is not to be confused with dew, which condenses from the atmosphere onto the plant surface.

"""

The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): """"But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."""" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: """"Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."""" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the """"statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"""" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.
It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding """"as some hold"""". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.

Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.

There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.

In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.

The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. 

Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.

I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.

It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound",0

 Appeal 

I think your treatment of me has been a little unfair. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.
Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.
I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a rea",0

Fowler&fowler; has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment. 
Nichalp says in the present thread """"The term """"British India"""" is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India"""". I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.
On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. 
Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. 
In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  
One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?

"Coat of Arms of Vermont 
Hi, I presume your request is related to my assessment of the article for the heraldry and vexillology wikiproject. My reasoning was basically that it was too long to be a stub, and didn't have GA status, which meant it had to be either Start or B class; since it was on the short side I went for Start. Having read it once again I can't immediately think of any content which could be added. This is a problem I have with all coat of arms articles; once you've said what it looks like, when it was first used, who designed it and any possible symbolism, there's really not much else you can say unless the arms are old enough that you can trace the historical development. Having said that, it would possibly be interesting to know why the state has both a seal and a coat of arms.

I would however take issue with your statement Vermont is the only U.S. state to have authentic armorial bearings described in a blazon. First, what do you mean by an authentic coat of arms? Are there states which use fake coats of arms? Also given that the arms are an example of landscape heraldry you might find people arguing whether they are actually 'authentic' arms. Secondly, a blazon is just a written description of a coat of arms; given a picture of a coat of arms someone sufficiently experienced in heraldry can produce a blazon, so there's nothing particularly unique about a coat of arms having a blazon. (In the European tradition it is in fact the blazon that defines the arms rather than the visual representation). Thirdly, if you want to get picky, blazon usually refers to the anglo-french jargon used to describe coats of arms, whereas the blazon of the CoA of Vermont is more like a layman's description, although it does throw in a few heraldic terms (I note that the external link you provide refers to the blazon as 'quasi-heraldic terminology'). Finally Vermont is not the only state which has a blazon enshrined in statute, see Coat of arms of North Dakota for example.

Regarding possible improvements, I would be inclined to add subheadings, e.g. history, blazon,Vermonter's badge. Also, now that you've added a couple of other sources it would probably be good to add citations to indicate which facts come from which source. The external link says that the arms were not defined by statute until 1862, but the article says differently; is the external site wrong? Quoting the statute numbers could possibly be useful. A couple more images could also be good, e.g. of the arms being used today, or historical versions showing the 'considerable liberties taken'.",0
"""

I believe the following description on the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_size is false: """"However, the larger area does not imply a better low-light sensitivity or higher signal-to-noise ratio. While the light collecting area is larger, this is canceled out by the fact that the same total light from the scene is spread out over a larger area, that is, the light flux per square mm is lower, for a fixed aperture diameter. Larger sensors can still be advantageous for low-light applications because typically lenses for them exist with larger apertures than are possible for smaller sensors.""""

The following was my attempt to correct this information:

""""A given lens will provide the same density of light on any sensor at a given aperture. For sensors with the same number of megapixels (MP), a large sensor will have proportionately larger pixels. The pixels on a 10 MP Full-Frame sensor will be more than twice as large as the pixels on an APS-C (2.3 times for Nikon, and 2.6 times for Canon). The larger pixel size is one of the reasons that full frame sensors typically have both superior sensitivity and reduced noise in low light in comparison to smaller sensors.  The smaller sensor is equivalent to a cropped section of the larger sensor but with smaller pixels, therefore much of the light from a full frame lens will fall off the edges of the smaller sensor and is """"wasted."""" Theoretically, a 10 MP (Canon) APS-C sensor should perform the same as a 26.3 MP full frame sensor, all other factors being equal.

Although a given lens will produce the same depth of field (DOF) regardless of the sensor, in practice DOF is also affected by the sensor size. This is because at a given focal length the photographer must stand further away from the subject in order to frame the same shot when using a camera with a smaller sensor. Since the DOF increases with the focal distance (distance between the lens and the subject), a photograph taken with an APS-C camera will have a deeper DOF than the identical photograph taken with a full frame camera using the same lens and aperture setting. The photographer can alternatively select a wider angle lens for the APS-C camera and stand at the same focal distance as with the full frame camera to frame the same shot, however the DOF will be affected in the exact same way since DOF also increases with wider angle (shorter focal length) lenses.""""

However it was deleted with no counter argument or explanation of the facts. I believe my description was clear, but I will leave the false information in place as I see no way to make the explanation any clearer than this.

Wikidemon, in the source you linked, did the researchers take into account that some deaths might be accidental and not representative of effects of the so called stress associated with the presidency? I find this information very important and interesting observation and it is a substantial overstatement that Obama's health is fine and somehow ununique. Everybody's body has had a unique past and is unique at the present state and a result of how someone treats their body. The truth is that there is no such thing as normal especially given substantial genetic differences and the vast differences in lifestyle including diet, activity levels, and drug use, etc. Scjessey, do you have a source that claims that Obama's health is , in your words, """"perfectly normal and unexceptional"""" And tell me the date of publication? I think I have a very good point given that researchers have decided that this topic is important enough to do large scale academic research on this topic. That in and of it self deserves at least a one sentence mention, perhaps not even in this article. Media outlets have reported this. Is there a wikipedia wide consensus that somehow a media coverage is not notable solely because it is, in your words """"as a matter of routine"""" or is that your point at all?

One more thought on this topic, which I think is very important. Although I instinctively feel All Blacks should be the name for this page, there is a real difference between the two names - the All Blacks aren't only, as  Cvene64 stated, """"the New Zealand Rugby Football Union First XV"""". The All Blacks were [until very recent tours] also the team which played non-international games on tour. Hence Zinzan Brooke, for example, has played 58 times [58 tests] for 'the New Zealand national team', and another 42 for the All Blacks. A quick look at the official All Blacks site  shows numerous players who have played several matches for the All Blacks but have never played for the New Zealand national team in an international match.

As the 2 names are not exactly equivalent, I have to agree with GordyB and Duncharris that strictly speaking we should not use All Blacks as the main name for this article. 13:13, 4 September""",0

 Undue weight on one controversy - proposed solution 

This article has a """"Controversies"""" section with several detailed sentences about the Miller-Young incident in 2014. WP:CSECTION says """"sections within an article dedicated to negative criticisms are normally also discouraged. Topical or thematic sections are frequently superior to sections devoted to criticism"""" and """"Sections or article titles should generally not include the word 'controversies'.""""

This article shouldn't have a standalone """"Controversies"""" section; controversies should be discussed in context in the """"History"""" section if they're important to the history of the university. Looking at the current """"History"""" section, it's very brief - for example, there are only two sentences about the May 2014 IV killings, which is very important in the history of UCSB, and it doesn't mention the 2001 IV killings, which are also important to its history. There is a longer article at History of the University of California, Santa Barbara with more room for detail. I propose that we should move discussion of the Miller-Young controversy to that history article and consider reducing it there. I can do that myself, but it's a somewhat sensitive subject so I'm putting it up for discussion first.    """,0

Further research has refuted that claim, and nanodiamonds are not delivered in situ, they are created in the impact. In fact further research has concluded that the nanodiamonds are a mix of cubic, hexagonal, new previously unknown polymorphs and always accompanied by a mix of carbon sheet polymorphs, that transition nearly continuously to nanodiamond. The Madden found nanodiamonds in the sediments in Oklahoma, and completely independent secondary result that you insisted on deleting from the reference list.

I think there's a 5th force: long-term editors who believe that they need to/can/can only counter particular editing behavior by altering the policy.  This is exacerbated by their apparent utter unwillingness to see that the effects of the policy they insist upon go far beyond correcting the unwanted behavior.  (They also are or become blind to the fact that the objections raised are due to this unwarranted and disruptive side-effect.)  Actually, the policy probably almost is ineffectual against any behavior: the policy is invoked when the long-term editors challenge the edits.  That the policy says anything about source (or material) types is scarcely noticed by those doing such edits.  We can be virtually certain that any policy wording can and will be used/misused by those with an agenda.  Policy needs to be crafted very carefully.

 Proposition 

This article is overwhelmed with images of socialist emblems. This is not a gallery, this is an article about socialist heraldry, and it is no rally useful to have images of every single socialist emblem ever used. I think we should make an inclusion criteria for images of emblems in this article. I propose this inclusion criteria: 
We should only add to this article images of emblems of internationally recognized states that existed for more than few years. If the state used several similar emblems during it's existence, they should not all be added, but only the one that was used the longest.
According to this proposition, we don't need emblems of unrecognized states like Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. We also do not need three emblems of Socialist Bulgaria () because they are very similar, practically the same. I am going to remove some emblems according to this proposition.

Your usual obfuscation. There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural/free convection when forced convection (the common type that happens in car radiators) works just as well as illustration. Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy (not heat) can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there. That means heat pumps don't really pump heat but rather energy. Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there, cannot even be defined! If you can't put a number on it you can't claim it's """"real """".

Temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this, when energy of phase transitions is involved. For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else, and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer. They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved. That's a clue that they aren't fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically. Physically it is potential energy being moved, not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there. It actually has nothing to do with """"heat"""" in a thermodynamic sense. 18:46, 14""",0

 Table size dispute on How the Earth Was Made

First let me say good job on listing all those problems with the article and I'll get right to them. However, there was at least one thing on that list that I don't exactly agree with. In the Strawberry Dorms section under the Seven mysteries subsection, it is called Seven mysteries because that is what the students at the school refer to the phenomenon as. Later, we find that there are in fact 12 seperate stories but only seven are known to each student, hence the name. Finally, only 8 are listed because those were the only 8 of the 12 presented and there will never be any more; it was purely an aspect of the anime and I highly doubt they'll touch upon it again. Listing what was given to me was all I could do. Also, adding an {{incomplete}} tag wouldn't do any good since aside from the cleanup (which I can do myself), no more information from the 4 missing mysteries or the ones not explained with ever appear in the series.

"Topic ban violation and sock puppetry
Hello. You had some interaction with IP  in connection with the Golan Heights  so accordingly, I am notifying you and Stifle of a matter that is of serious concern.
 
I have reason to believe that this IP user is Nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by Stifle. The ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the Golan Heights and all areas of Israel and its environs including cities, settlements and regions.
 
The IP in question geolocates to Chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with Nableezy’s POV.  Prior to the instant edits, the IP never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to The Golan Heights. 

Nableezy is also from Chicago as evidenced from his early Trait Page
 
But there is more. The subject IP also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the NHL. Nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this 
 
But the similarities between the IP user and nableezy do not end there. The subject IP made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics. 
 
Nableezy attended Illinois Institute of Technology, a school that emphasizes engineering and IT evidenced by his early Trait List 
 
So now we have an IP who, like Nableezy, comes from Chicago with interests in the Golan Heights, Hockey and IT. The coincidences are too great to ignore per WP:DUCK. The evidence suggests that The IP is Nableezy's sock puppet used to circumvent Stifle's topic ban.",0

"""==My complaint about the WMF==
When assessing WMF's policies, one need not resort to vicious name-calling or opprobrious epithets. One need only present the facts. Let's start with my claim that WMF insists that it can bring about peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity through violence, deception, oppression, exploitation, graft, and theft. Sorry, WMF, but, with apologies to Gershwin, """"it ain't necessarily so."""" Gloomy philodoxes like WMF are not born—they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, if WMF's patsies had even an ounce of integrity they would urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that a real fight against vagarious, gin-swilling Comstockism can be undertaken only if a basic change in social conditions makes it possible to set the stage so that my next letter will begin from a new and much higher level of influence.

Forgive me for boring you with all the gory details, but I must ask that WMF's torchbearers change the world for the better. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire. All the deals WMF makes are strictly one-way. WMF gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. WMF's belief is that it should be free to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as """"improvident, rambunctious know-nothings"""" in order to justify operations against them. Hey, WMF! Satan just called; he wants his worldview back.

I've tried to explain to WMF's snarky pals that WMF is incapable of looking with an open mind at anything that doesn't strictly endorse its views. As could be expected, they were a bit slow on the uptake. I just couldn't get them to comprehend that I can say one thing about WMF. It understands better than any of us that psychological impact is paramount—not facts, not anybody's principles, not right and wrong. I'm not suggesting that we behave likewise. I'm suggesting only that WMF is unquestionably proud of itself for conconcting such a """"brilliant"""" scheme for harming others or even instilling the fear of harm. In my opinion, however, that's the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Much better would be to give the needy a helping hand as opposed to an elbow in the face. That's the end of this letter. If I was unable to convince you that I am making an appeal to the intelligence of the reader not to be fooled by WMF's demagoguery, then you should definitely consider contacting me with your supporting or refuting evidence, opinions, personal stories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next letter.

"User Kannambadi, please do not try to frighten and justify blocks on me.  Did the person who blocked me on two occasions (first of all I do know, it was you and your other friends who cannot tolerate a counter opinion, who prompted the irresponsible blocking on the previous occasions.... you are again giving a seemingly sage advice for first discussing before carrying out edits.... do you remember what you told the user (I forget his name, but he was from Maharashtra)?  You wrote: I borrow from Kamath, you go and get it from a good library. I have a good library near my home and town, where the book is available. Thus, you left it all on the person countering YOUR opinion to prove otherwise.... Why not do the same thing this time around?  

I have indeed borrowed from two books called Ancient India, one by K.A.N.Sastri and R.C.Roychowdhuri. These are two books of the same name by the above named two authors with Roychowdhuri borrowing extensively from Sastri.  I also think that the book by K.A.N.Sastri is dated 1959 while the one of Roychowdhury is either 1951 or 1961, probably it is 1961 edition.  Roychowdhuri's book is quite different from the edition of the same book available on the internet at books.google.com/.

Please also try preaching the same to the irresponsible user who blocked me in that he should also have practiced what you are preaching me.... that is first indulge in a discussion before taking action to block contributors like me. Did he do that? He simply barged into my page like a bull in the china shop and blindly commented that I have made personal commentary on the Chola page and hence he was blocking me.  This after I had painstakingly borrowed from noted epigraphist Huntzsh's summary of the rule of the Chola empire where he had sought to dispel the notions that they were devout Saivites by saying that during the rule of the second Chola king i.e. Aditya I itself, two temples i.e. the Siva Temple of Chidambaram and the one at Srirangam being a Vishnu temple and regarded the most important Siva and Vishnu temples, were both declared as Kuladhanam (family heritage sites) for the Chola kings (ordaining in a way that the kings of this dynasty one after another will look personally after the upkeep of traditions at both the temples and their well being). Indeed, I made the mistake of not quoting Prof. Huntzsh (again courtesy the site you love to deride calling it a POV website despite using it to support points on Chalukyas and Hoysalas) but on my very next visit on the same day, I found that the 'department of dirty tricks' had prompted Blinguen to block me for the second time. Does Blinguen have any knowledge at all of Indian history, most of all of the history of the Cholas, Hoysalas or Pandiyans and most of all of your beloved Chalukya Cholas?  Certainly I would have loved to engage him on a one to one debate on Indian history especially that of South India.  I also wrote to Taprobanus wanting to prosecute Blinguen and requested for his address.  

It is a shame that cowards contacted him it seems on the email or on phone to complain about me, but no one ever wrote about it in the open, no one contacted me and most of all no one ever wanted to discuss the matter. Rather, people who scarcely contributed to the Chola page like user Earth etc. started advocating this and that.  Mind you, user Earth himself was adviced by another admin when he complained about me that the contributions made by me were in good faith only, but it seems ultimately the dirty gang on wikipedia bent upon converting it into some sort of monkeypedia finally had their say.

What you basically always do is you want to write and not just that, you want whatever you write to be retained at all costs, but in the process, you forget counter opinions by other historians as well.  K.A.N.Sastri has written in his book (as opposed to what you wrote quoting Kamath that Satyasraya defeated crown prince Rajendra), that Rajendra Chola defeated Satyasraya (he wrote something like: next was the turn of Satyasraya who fled the battlefield near the fields of Hottur-??) and hid in the jungles of Kogali and Kadambalige.  I would say 'exactly' for you find among the limited number of inscriptions available of Satyasraya (courtesy: the site you always try to trash inscriptions.whatsindia.com/) which are indeed found at Kogali and Kadambalige and in fact in a couple of these inscriptions Satyasraya even is called as 'ruling from Kadambalige'. Kindly access this information in the same manner as I have done and exactly in the same manner as you expect others to do, i.e. access appropriate information from appropriate sources.   Even in this, I do not want to claim whatever I say is correct, indeed if Satyasraya is attributed by Kamath with victory over Rajendra then kindly also quote other sources where Rajendra claims victory over the Chalukyas including the most important Wo",0

The new 'undo' button next to each edit in the 'history' tab of an article, can be used to try and undo that specific edit, it's success is dependent on there not being any conflicting intermediate edits between that particular edit and the current version of the article.  One can also go back to a previous version, by going to the article's history, and editing an old revision of the page. If you do this, any changes made since that revision will be removed.

(Please note that there is no way for other Wikipedians to verify that this comment was indeed made by the named person. But I am going to assume that it was.)

The """"senior"""" is a direct quote from the cited source, the 2005 Wired article 
SmartWater CEO Phil Cleary, a retired senior detective, hit upon the idea after watching burglars he had apprehended walk free from court due to lack of evidence.
Usually Wired magazine is considered a reasonably reliable source. But since the fact in question is not very important in the context of this Wikipedia article, I am just going to remove it.

My answer: 
Jusus article has 100% images of Jesus which are accepted/used/associated about Jesus in 90% of Christianians.

Muhammad article 100% images of Muhammad which are accepted/used/associated about Muhammad in 0.1% of Muslims as well as nonmuslims in all the history. 

There is not even a single mosque having the image of Muhammad hanged and represented, which proves that the image in wikipedia article is purely a POV for few people who argue about the image that it is related to some 'unknown' painter and was used in a short span of history.

Use of the image having no source and no creator, is the violation of wikipedia images policy and not my personal opinion.

If there is an image which represents and is associated to Muhammad in mainstream Muslims/nonMuslims then use it. If there is no such image then it does NOT imply that you put some non-representing image or you put some image which is not associated to Muhammad by Mainstream Muslims/nonmuslims but by very few people in a short span of history.",0

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations. However, this instance is completely pointless.

Please remove this extraneous nonsense.""",0

 New 2012 study by Mark Regnerus, sociology professor at the University of Texas 

A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy """"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships"""" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.

Due to the findings, it is very controversial, and that is why my edit here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality_and_psychology&diff;=497579176&oldid;=497039907 and here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LGBT_parenting&diff;=497585303&oldid;=497583187 has been undone, simply because another user disagreed and claimed the study is: """"widely criticized and flawed."""" Criticized by whom? It is a new study, nobody had yet written an article debunking it. Flawed according to whom? Your personal opinion? That is not a reason to vandalise the article and undo my edit.

The study is published and available here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610

The fact that this is not allowed on the article prior a """"discussion"""" is unfair. What difference does it make? They are findings from a study; how could a """"talk"""" about it make any difference? Do we have to come to an """"agreement"""" to put this information into the article itself?

This is not objective and completely unprofessional, not to mention biased. This is nothing more than intentionally leaving a study out of the article because somebody disagrees with the findings.

There is no valid, honest, objective reason to remove this information from the article, yet I was forced to open a """"talk"""" about it because of no other reason than somebody not liking the results of the study. This is unacceptable, yet here I am anyway, opening a """"talk"""" about it. So, what is there to discuss? Your opinion disagreeing with the results?

This is untrue.  I have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons, since the reasons mentioned are not actually true.  It is impossible to """"exhibit a battleground attitude"""" because of many reasons, including the fact that one cannot """"exhibit"""" something unless one is a display engineer at a museum, and it would therefore be impossible to """"exhibit"""" anything let alone a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as a """"battleground attitude,"""" the fact that there is no such thing as an """"attitude"""" in regards to how a human being acts, and the fact that the word """"exhibit"""" is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user (antagonizing me).  Usage of words like """"exhibit"""" and """"attitude"""", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  

The second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.  I have specifically attempted to PREVENT other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner, as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations, for which I reported him but yet the people at the ALLEGED """"help desk"""" refused to tell me where to report him, and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently.  Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly """"myself making it difficult to communicate,"""" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to """"disable the private messaging system"""".))

There were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.

""""Refusal to abide by the site's guidelines"""" is impossible since 1) """"guidelines"""" and """"rules"""" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.

You have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was """"done in multiple venues,"""" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.                       """,0

Things I've learned at en.wikipedia
 When I made a change and I want that the edition appears, I am a user disruptive because I don't respect the previous edition. When I defend the previous edition, the concept """"previous edition"""" means nothing. Or the dates are ignored and I'm the disruptive again. The two solutions are good.

 Although it is not written anywhere, exist a rule that says that any offense expires in a few days. If you can not give notice of the offense (because you were blocked, ill or without computer for a mechanical failure...), bad luck for you. Here solutions, not justice. And that Pope Time erases the sins is a good solution.

 Open spaces for dialogue and discussion and pledge to respect the result is not a sign of wanting to do things right.

 Apparently appreciate the intention of a user is not feasible, but ignore two serious violations of the rules is perfectly acceptable.

Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs  
It should be noted that February the 11th, Catholic Church also celebrates Notre Dame de Lourdes a.k.a Our Lady of Lourdes (south-west of France). Another (non related ?) coincidence  François-Bernard Michel who co-presides the Lourdes Medical BureauComité Médical International de Lourdes (in french) http://fr.lourdes-france.org/approfondir/guerisons-et-miracles/composition-comite-medical-international-lourdes, presides also the French National Academy of Medicine for the year 2013. He is also member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, he presided twice, at Institut de France, chair XIII, created in 1998.

 Generally, Ukrainians all support pro-Western democracy and they are no worse than other Europeans, for example Romanians. Ukrainians are as smart and sophisticated, as, for example, Poles. Many good Ukrainians are interested in travel and work opportunities in such developed and very democratic countries as France, Germany or Portugal.

I think red tape accurately and succinctly communicates the situation you describe, especially given that in a prior version you yourself wrote
Attempts to rectify this situation working through official channels did not work
which it seems to me is the very essence of (extreme) red tape. If you like we can say instead official indifference or unresponsiveness, but I don't see how that better informs the reader.
I also don't see how your wording makes the point you mention re success in decrypting and the importance of that success. Obviously a request for more resources will try to convince the recipient that such will help the writers to better do what they've been tasked to do. To spell out that their desire was """"to achieve the productivity that was possible"""" would be completely superflous  of course that was the goal. And surely no reader needs to be told that better productivity / faster decrypting / etc. meant the entire difference between valuable intelligence and useless retrospective. Your wording doesn't mention any of that stuff anyway.
Further (as I've said before) I also don't see why it matters what specific type of resource was lacking  the important points are: (a) the codebreakers felt that they could not do the best job possible without more resources; (b) Churchill unhesitatingly granted them carte blanche, showing the importance he attached to their work and the breadth of his authority in making such decisions. What doesn't matter is just what it was that was lacking  typists? paperclips? light bulbs?
Some of these elements could be incorporated to enliven the narrative e.g. some kind of """"for want of a nail""""-type angle  """"Look, Prime Minister, you've gathered all these first-class minds here but we can't get anything done because we have to do our own bloody TYPING!""""  if sources lay something like that out.

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )""",0

So Jezz gets to personally attack, assume bad faith, and violate WP policy by removing chunks of material from my own comment in an article Talk page.   Gotcha.   I do not accept your decision as valid, fair, or equitably applied.  I only wrote on Jezz's talk page because he was violating WP policy and insulting me and undoing my comments on the article talk page, and ignoring and disrespecting all the work and good-faith presentations I made on the article talk page.   You agree iwth him removing chunks of my comment on the article talk page, though WP does not allow that?

 How to insert new data into a sortable table 

Sorting makes the lists more useful, but more marginally more difficult to add new data.  It's not difficult once you understand that sorting numerically isn't possible because of BC in some of the years and commas in the casualty figures.  All we are doing here is converting those numbers into an alphabetic format that the table can sort.

Sorting for casualties, zero padding is necessary if we are going to use comma separators
CCCC represents the casualty number
Use:{{formatnum:{{padleft:CCCC|7|0}}}} 
Example: {{formatnum:{{padleft:300000|7|0}}}} produces 0,300,000
In case of a range, like (5,000-10,000), only the first number needs to use the formatnum template to make it sortable.
The use of the tilde '~' destroys the sort order.  I don't think it's really necessary since almost all of these numbers are approximate anyway.

To make years sortable we have to insert invisible characters before the actual values.
To do this, we use  anything here is invisible
 YYYY represents the year
For years BC:
Use: !{{#expr: 9999 - YYYY}} YYYY BC
Example: 846 BC becomes !{{#expr: 9999 - 846}} 846 BC
Note the space just before the . It is necessary!
For years AD:
We pad left N number of zeros to make the year 4 digits
Use: #NYYYY
Example: 3 becomes #0003
Example: 34 becomes #0034
Example: 345 becomes #0345
Example: 1456 becomes #1456
Note there is no space before and after the . Also necessary!

It looks more complex than it really is, trust me ;)""",0

Quote from Peter Sugar, """"The Early History and the Establishment of the Ottomans in Europe"""": There the Hungarian-Wallachian alliance was still in effect, and Bayezid I now moved against Mircea. Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  """,0

  Look, I understand that Wikipedia doesn't try to add to knowledge, and only reports on what already exists. I brought up all of my little scenarios about being a preacher or author or internet essayist to prove a common point- it's not like an idea has to be written down to exist.
  I just wrote a lengthy counter argument but then realized that I was essentially restating what I had said before, and so the whole thing would be of no aid.
  Let me just say this- you think that my interpretations aren't commonsense, but I do- both make absolute perfect sense, but you're just sitting there right now like, """"uh, no."""" I mean, angel means messenger, so how is it impossible that some Biblical passages concerning angels aren't actually speaking about human messengers? Tell me. Prove me wrong. If angel means messenger then how can it perhaps not sometimes be referring to human messengers?

I think that my contributions were blocked mostly because you don't agree with me.

I know that if I were to write a book with my opinions in it and then quote it on Wikipedia saying, """"page 10 of John Smith's book says..."""" it would not be blocked, because it is 100% true that my book would have those contents.

Arbitration enforcement action appeal by WookieInHeat

Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found in this 2010 ArbCom motion. According to that motion, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

 Appealing user   –   

 Sanction being appealed  - Blocked for 48 hours for: """"Personal attacks or harassment: NPA and ARBPIA violation - accused editor of supporting terrorism"""" - Discussion of sanctions at WP:AE

 Administrator imposing the sanction  

 Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.

Statement by WookieInHeat

Georgewilliamherbert's reason for blocking me relied solely upon the idea that i personally attacked Nableezy by accusing him of """"supporting terrorism"""". from an absolutist POV, nowhere in any edit was the word """"terrorism"""" even mentioned. my observation that nableezy's political POV on wikipedia aligns with the political goals of hamas was by no means meant as a personal attack, nor to insinuate the more abstract idea of nableezy's support for terrorism. my primary intention was to highlight nableezy's possible WP:COI with the subject while he was pushing to have negative information about it removed. my main point here is that i find george's reasoning for my block to have been rather arbitrary and ambiguous.also, the duration of the blocks handed out seems somewhat irrational. nableezy, a user with a lengthy history of often thinly veiled and sometimes outright personal attacks not to mention numerous complaints about their civility, was given only a token block of three hours for a direct personal attack . whereas i have no significant or pertinent history of incivility and was blocked for 16 times that length (48 hours) for what some have misconstrued as a personal attack based on the wholly fabricated idea that i called someone a """"terrorism supporter"""". not to mention nableezy plainly knew that his blatant personal attack would result in a ban, where i went to some length to clarify that my comment was not a personal attack. also, i did not respond when nableezy attacked me directly, and i was the first user to drop the argument and bring the discussion back to the topic at hand .i really cannot stress enought the fact that i never accused nableezy of """"supporting terrorism"""", not only did i never directly say this, it was never even implied by my comments. thus it would seem my block was based entirely on a misconception of what was meant when i said """"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association hamas""""  implying this was actually instead intended to say """"nableezy displays his affinity for the palestinian cause, and by association terrorism"""". this is simply not the case, and frankly i am somewhat offended myself at george's insinuation that i would arbitrarily class",0

 see http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html exposing Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic.

I was not given any possibility of replying to the block request discussion, because he also did not link this anywhere on my page and on his page I saw a template (posted to him by a user of a different time he has done this) stating that doing so is required.  Basically, the user who reported me shows clearly in """"bad faith"""". The fact that I am being forced to defend on myself on Wikipedia for 12+ hours is not a valid reason for a block.  No """"personal attacks"""" were made, no """"refusal"""" to do anything was done as no """"orders"""" were given that could be """"refused"""" due to the fact the """"orders"""" did not even happen, and being a victim of others who are repeatedly attacking me and even deleting my replies from discussion pages before archiving, and defending myself from these continuous attacks, is NOT a valid reason for a block.  As for the articles which caused people to attack and harass me, nothing regarding these articles was ever properly done.  No messages asking to discuss it, no polls done to find out which information is correct, no editing done after my edits for the purpose of further improving the article, nothing constructive or reasonable whatsoever, just reverting the entire edit without discussion or reasonableness, lying about the reason for reverting, harassment, and making fraudulent claims against me such as """"adding information without sources"""", regardless of the fact that 1) I did not ADD any information to the article and 2) it is okay to add information that does not have  a source, and most new articles consist mainly, and some entirely, of such information.  Someone wrote something about """"friendly advice,"""" but not a SINGLE related comment was at all """"friendly,"""" and no advice was given whatsoever except for one which was both unhelpful and contained more untrue statements.  Even this administrator is purposefully making blatantly fraudulent statements, claiming that I """"ignored guidelines in regards to my signature"""", regardless of the fact that the one who changed Wikipedia's code to no longer link automatically is not me, nor did they notify me, nor could anyone think of a reasonable reason to do this, regardless of the fact that it has been less then 24 hours since anyone requested that I learn programming code and then re-code my signature to compensate for this flaw, that's right less then 24 hours let alone a reasonable time of 4 months or so (assuming the user has logged in for several hours every day during that time), and regardless of the fact that even in that minuscule amount of time my signature had already been re-coded before he ever did this block.  This shows that the administrator himself is specifically in bad faith by citing an alleged """"problem"""" that no longer even exists.  There is also a log of the LITERAL AND DIRECT EXACT OPPOSITE of the claim of the person who reported me (again, WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME TO REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MATTER), at the Help Desk page.  I advise that people looking at this do not read that conversation as evidence of replies and such, because several of my replies were deleted before the conversation was archived and therefore it is an invalid archive, BUT it does show the exact opposite of this claim in that I specifically complained about someone for doing that very thing because the conversation between MYSELF AND HIM should be done at only ONE place, and should also be done at one of the appropriate pages, rather then being harassive by using different places as this Administrator is claiming I have done when there is direct evidence that I've done the opposite.  So the main thing being that I am the victim of numerous people attacking me, they should not have attacked me but instead should have done any of the things I mentioned, or some other reasonable thing, rather then reverting edits and then attacking and harassing me.  I did not deserve any such harassment and attacks and do have the right to defend such things.  If I am treated fairly instead then there could be a discussion on the matter instead of repeated reverting without any discussion, then no such people would be """"reporting"""", but, since I did not do the things in the report other then correcting articles, and since the decent reply to correcting articles which someone else thinks are incorrect is not to attack them as was done to me, the block is wrong because things should be differently and because the people who were """"edit warring"""" on purpose were other people rather then myself.

Do you see someone shuffling from left to right and vice versa or someone pivoting on one foot. You of course know exactly what traverse means, but anyone who needs the term explained in plain English could be misled.

This is all rather moot I think, as I realise that I have become stuck in a pre-wiki way of doing things, in which descriptions had to be in the text, the ideal solution of course is to remove the description from the article completely and instead provide a wikilink to the traverse section of the gun laying article, where those who need it explained can find a far better explaination than a couple of words in brackets.

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

tsk tsk..

  

 Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi 

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?  

Can we also be enlightened under what rules of Wikipedia not understood by vandals, is this kind of editing and then awarding an article such as this riddled with holes is permissible?

""""And a couple more texts are required if you study quantum theory related to those subjects"""" Quantum theory started by a German Max Planck, but nobody knew its real mathematical background therefore it remained just a semi-science, until a Hungarian János Neumann made it. Lot of famous scientist of the era tried to made the mathematical background of the Q.theory but its proved to difficult for them. Neumann redefinied the definitions, he pointed out serials of former serious errors. He made Q. theory to a calculable science which made it a practicable science for industry. He invented the famous game theory and designed the world-famous ENIAC digital computer too.(ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer,[1][2] was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was a Turing-complete, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems.[3] ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. When ENIAC was announced in 1946 it was heralded in the press as a """"Giant Brain"""". It boasted speeds one thousand times faster than electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has since matched. This mathematical power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists.) Neumann was the main mathematican in Manhattan Project. Other famous Hungarian was Jenő Wigner often reffered as the father of quantum mechanics. Other famous Hungarian: Leó Szilárd his invention changed the basis of nuclear science:  he invented the nuclear chain reaction and invented the nuclear reactor (and he invented with Wigner the first nuclear power station) as well as the first Particle accelerator. Therefore the nuclear physics became a practicable/utilizable science for mankind. As the inventor nuclear chain reaction, he realised foremost the atomic-bomb, he made the basic """"Cutaway Drawing"""" of the first atomic bomb. He asked Albert Einstein to write letter to president Roosevelt for the realization of a concrete nuclear Bomb. In Manhattan project dosens of scientist and hundreds of engineers worked for the realization of Szilárd's idea: a working atomic bomb from 1939-1944. An other Hungarian Ede Teller invented the H-bomb. And it is just particle quantum / nuclear physics. It is just a branch of physics.  We had dosens of similar great scientists in other branchs of the physics and natural sciences.
The exaggeratedly anglocentric Rico have never heard about these scientists. The expert historians of natural sciences are always shocked about great number of Hungarian scientists, how is it possible for such a little country.

Sure. What do you mean? I am in the process of writing a little welcome and how to. John, if you recall the minor dispute about the Estonia links really caught me off guard and I was a bit thin-skinned in taking criticism for what I thought was my helpful addition of a couple of links. I learned from that and other experiences here that practically every article has two sides, and that you can't just go in and naiively think you're adding objective information, when that info most likely has already been debated. I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.) They were quick to jump to that conclusion, I thought, based only on a few bits of info gleaned from my posts. Anyway, I'm trying to make it clear that I do not do anything on Wikipedia because of what I do for a living. And I wanted to point out, with the """"About me: Who cares"""", that I do not participate here to draw attention to myself or to please my employer.  

 BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view.

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

A Wiki page entitled CrossFire Fusor, that was deleted in October 2010, as a result of this AfD debate:

now appears to have come back to life, in a new page here:

Another apparent bit of pseudoscience by Moacir L. Ferreira implanted on Wikipedia can be found here:

Thank you! I have updated the draft with my changes.   

I'll trust Anthony's judgement on this matter but normally it's reasonable to protect pages that are temporarily restored for DRV.   
I understand that pages restored for DRV are generally protected. However, because this was a speedy deletion, and because I had addressed the speedy deletion reason with a rewrite, I think it was a good application of unprotection.

US conservatives didn't """"adopt"""" the term in the early 90s; it would be more accurate to say that by the early 90s the excesses of """"political correctness"""" became more widely known and many people (not just """"US conservatives"""") began to ridicule it (particularly as manifest in the implemnetation of draconian speech codes on college campuses and the aggressive promotion of increasingly dubious and absurd assertions of what might be construed as """"offensive""""). The term has come to be used in mischevous ways at times by people to ridicule positions they disagree with (an example would be creationsts categorizing the teaching of evolution as """"political correctness""""). 

The article in short seems to reflect the perspective of someone of an """"activist left"""" sensibility that is more interested in addressing popular backlash against political correctness than in objectively describing it. It's really not as complicated as the article makes it out to be. In brief, politically correctness is simply a word for efforts to alter or prohibit innocuous language or other activities that are unreasonably or implausibly asserted to be offensive. Unfortunately efforts to honestly describe it seem to be a magnet for what might be called """"political correctness denialists"""" (the idea that there is no such thing as political correctness; it's all just right wing agitprop etc.).""",0
"'s vandalism/lies/distortion of facts/mis-use of lack of communication between wiki administrators/WP:POV pushing 

I am putting it here, kindly read the whole story alongwith the proofs.

It appears that Admin User:Abecedare has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon User: 32.177.111.155 simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia. Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors ( User: 32.177.111.155 and User: 209.183.55.115  ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well.

Why User Talk: 32.177.111.155's Block was unjustified

User Talk: 32.177.111.155’s edits do not constitute vandalism

He simply restored duly referenced text. 
 Proof 1
 Proof 2
 Proof 3

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 did not violate WP:3rr 

He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 can not be a called a sockpuppet

 It was mentioned that User: 209.183.55.115 is licensed to Concord, CA and User: 32.177.111.155 is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another. 
  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry?
If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book). User:Neutralhomer refused to accept following references only because he could not like them:

They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults.

I don't know if you're Wikignoming because you lack the time or resources to expand articles or if it's just something you prefer to do, but there's certainly other stuff that you can be profitably be doing. Ship article titles need to have the ship's name in italics or you could focus on improving their categorization, neither of which I tend to remember to do anything about. Adding convert templates to articles is certainly worthwhile, although I'd suggest you limit your preference for always abbreviating everything. For one thing, I like to show the hyphen form of a compound adjective like 15-inch gun, something that abbreviating eliminates. You could ensure that articles written in AmEnglish use American spelling of units and vice versa; just be sure not to change the type of English unless there are strong national connections like RN ships use BritEng or USN ships use AmEng. Articles on non-English speaking navies' ships have no national connection and can be written in either form; just be sure that it's consistent within the article.

Regrettably, I have to agree about the Gameplay section. It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow:
""""Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's """"cowboy father"""", the """"family dog"""", an """"inept thief"""", and """"abused monkey"""""""" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment.
""""Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and """"thing"""",[3] and opens to a """"pastoral forest village"""" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village.[2] With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot.[1] They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army.[4] Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like """"partying ghosts"""" and """"talking rope snakes"""".[5] Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear."""" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that.
The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until """"Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor."""" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound.
""""There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles"""" - First of all, this should start off with a """"However"""" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this.
"""" and lets the player see their magic """"PSI power"""" abilities"""" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon?
""""While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects."""" - By """"completely new"""" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.

If you're up to rewriting this, which I encourage - especially if you're shooting for FA - I'd recommend a structure like the following:
Paragraph 1: It's a top-down JRPG, there's an overworld, you explore towns with your team of characters, yada yada yada.
Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?).
Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.
Stuff like items and saving (can you save anywhere?) - work in wherever you want; I'm not picky.   21:47, 25 September 2014 (UTC",0

Apparently I will have to take this up on the talk page of the originator of this nonsense or a flock of meatpuppets will be visiting me again. 

Here is what you reverted (in case you didn't read it previously):

===April 2012===
 
Your recent editing history at Centrifugal force shows that you are currently engaged in an edit war. Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.
 
To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors. You can post a request for help at a relevant noticeboard or seek dispute resolution. In some cases, you may wish to request temporary page protection.

 Bot is deleting wikiproject banners 

see  where the bot deleted a wikiproject banner with the summary """"Notifying of move discussion""""  65.92.180.137  
This is interesting. The bot did just fine when it first posted the notice at 03:00, 6 March 2013.
Seven days later, after leaving the notice undisturbed for a week, at 00:14, 13 March 2013 it removed the project template and updated its timestamp.
That's not the only talk page banner it disturbed with that update. Also:
Talk:Malling, Moselle – at 00:15, 13 March 2013
Talk:Monastyrysche Raion – at 00:16, 13 March 2013
This seems to be some one-off glitch—I've not seen this bug before. It may be a side-effect of some other issue, and could be hard to track down.   
Whatever the bug is, it is causing a wholesale overwrite of the entire talk page, from what I can see, it deletes the entire talk page, and replaces it with the new notice.  65.92.180.137  
Excellent observation! It could be something more like this type of problem. I'll put it on my list to check the code to see if any edit checks can be made to prevent it.   

The Wikipedia:Requested moves/Current discussions update of 00:16, 13 March 2013 doesn't really give any clues, unless it's related to the """"Time could not be ascertained"""" bug. I should fix that one. –   
 I think I finally realize the cause of this (an API function's failure to retrieve the page content when asked), and will get right to implementing the solution, which is to not update the page at all rather than break it.   
, hopefully.   20:43, 13 December""",0

Edit war at HaEdah HaCharedis
Edit war with Meshulam. Please step in. I don't get his point, there is nothing POV in my edits. On the contrary, my edits turned a near-stub into a much bigger article, I cleaned up the introduction (gone are all those alternative spellings). I do not understand what his problem is. He also removed the JewsAgainstZionism link, since """"this is only one of thousands of positions they have"""".

 Comment from IP 

I was a Sophmore in High School when the 37th division was sent to the South Pacific theater of war. Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.

On another subject, the Name of Medal of Honor winner, John J. Petrarcal is new to me. There is a famous ballad about the only Medal of Honor Winner about whom I had ever read, and that Medal of Honor went to Pvt.Roger Young, 148 Infantry Division,37th Division  for bravery on the Island of New Georgia, in the Solomon Islands in May of 1942.

I in no way want to detract from John Petrarcal, but I wonder, are there possibly two heroes to recall?   Citations: Personal experience and 37th Division written History.

 Semantics of Private vs. Independent 
I think describing Canadian private schools as """"independent"""" is problematic. I think most would agree that there are specific connotations to each word that should be recognized. Calling something an independent school has positive connotations of independance, nobility, etc.. """"private"""" carries connotations of exclusion, elitism, and could be seen as a more negative desciption of these schools. I personally think private is the more appropriate term for schools existing outside of the public system requiring yearly tuition in excess of $20,000+.

 WikiProject Oregon 

About this editI'm sorry you thought being moved to """"inactive"""" status meant that you had to leave the project. Nothing could be further from the truth. In order to make the membership list easy to maintain, we happen to have created some artificial criteria for the active list and although you certainly contribute a lot to Wikipedia in general, at the time, I couldn't find any participation in Oregon-related articles. In the interests of ease of maintenance of the list (most people show no interest in such a thankless task and have no opinion about how it is managed), I never bothered to inform folks when they had been moved, but that was probably a mistake. Needless to say, you are a very active Oregon Wikipedian, especially in the area of the WikiWednesday group and the legislative stuff, and that certainly counts for a lot. I've taken the liberty of moving your name back into the active participants list, but feel free to change that if you're not comfortable. We've started a long-overdue discussion about the participants list on the WP:ORE talk page, and I'd really welcome your input.
 
It's unfortunate that we were being sort of cliqueish last time you participated there. Note that my efforts at clarifying who was who in that conversation got totally screwed up.

But when I did wish to clarify that AM was male and I was femaleand that was merely for your edification so you could avoid awkward grammarit came across as short and snappish, as I had otherwise said all there was to say about my opinion in the matter. And then I got busy and never clarified my comments further. I'm really sorry if you felt ganged-up on and I hope you will come back. Cheers! P.S. I hope to make it up to WikiWednesday again one of these days soonso many projects, so few vacations days...   """,0

Yes, there is.

If one clicks on the """"History"""" tab at the top of the article, one can see any comments or explanations that the editor has made when summarising their edit.

In this case I was the editor that changed the wording back to what had been the consensus for some months. My edit summary was: """"'British Isles' included in section heading, so no confusion (please see: British_Isles_naming_dispute)"""".

It's not just Irish Nationalists that are a wee bit (too?) sensitive about the term and in this case the sub-heading of """"British Isles"""" should dispel any lingering confusion - as does the internal linking or re-direction of """"The North East Atlantic Archipelago"""".

If, after reading the referenced article, you are still unclear as to the rationale for the use I can try and explain further, but I hope the article will explain the term.

User:76.110.22.186 left the following message on my talk page: 

I love how you just undid all my work on the Eddie Brock page without asking me to change or edit. Thanks so much for being considerate. Unsourced original reasearch? Its already sourced at the bottom of the page , do you really need me to resource it? 
It's all in Amazing Spider-Man and it's all characterization which is completely essential to the article whether you fail to realize that or not. So you removed it stating that it could be integrated into the publication section...IT WAS ALREADY INTEGRATED THERE BEFORE YOU REMOVED IT.

I’m sorry that you’re upset over the removal of the material you added, but part of editing on Wikipedia means that your edits may be mercilessly edited, and if the material you add is found to be in violation of policy, then editors required to remove it. They are not under any obligation to ask your permission to do so, and in general, the Wikipedia community is not going to rearrange the way they do things in order to suit the demands of a newcomer. Rather, it is your obligation to learn the ropes here.  Responding to my rather polite post above, in which I complimented your work, and provided links to the relevant policies in question, with the message you left on my talk page, which was rather rude in tone, and ended with an all-caps remark (which is considered the equivalent of yelling on the Net), is a violation of the Wikipedia's Civility Policy, and is not the best way to show the community that you’re willing to be a part of it.

For now, I’ll put aside your message to me, and try to explain a bit further the policies in question. 

Yes, Wikipedia’s Verifiability Policy does require that we source the material we add to articles, so that readers can verify the material. They cannot do this if we do not inform them of where the material comes from.

The sources in question have to be reliable. That means they must be considered credentialed experts in the area in question. For comics, examples would be sources such as Wizard magazine, Comics Buyer’s Guide, The Comics Journal, Newsarama, Comic Book Resources, books by analysts like Danny Fingeroth, and interviews on DVDs of movies adapted from comics, as well as any mainstream press stories you can find.

Websites whose content is user-generated, such as personal blogs, forums, message boards, fan sites, other wikis, The Internet Movie Database, The Comic Book Database, etc., are not reliable, because anyone can create a blog or submit material to those sites, which do not exercise editorial control over that material. Exceptions to this would be the personal websites of people would be considered reliable sources in the field in question, such as Mark Evanier, John Byrne, Peter David, etc. (See WP:USERG, which is part of WP:Identifying Reliable Sources.)

Similarly unacceptable is material derived from the editor’s own personal opinions, observations or analyses, which is called Original Research. Adding an analytical comment to an article about a film is fine if it's from a review you cite by Roger Ebert. Adding such a comment when the observation comes from the editor who adds it is not. Some editors point to the primary material in which the narrative is found, but the primary sources (such as an issue of Amazing Spider-Man) only contains the narrative itself; it does not contain any analysis of it. Material is not quoted or paraphrased directly from a source, but which constitutes an analysis or observation derived from it is called synthesis, which is a form of original research. The bottom line the need to ask, Who is the person making the observation? If it's the editor, it's simply not permitted.

The website you cited in your revert is not a reliable or verifiable source, not only because it is a fan site, but because it doesn’t even mention any of the material you added. It simply lists issues of the books. You can’t just point to books and say, “It's all in Amazing Spider-Man”. The original stories might be, but comments like """"The key difference between Brock's heroism and Peter Parker's mainly being..."""" are not.

As for the remaining issues:
As far as the issue of integration is concerned, the analysis by Mike Conroy does not deal with the issue of characterization, so I added it to the Lead, where such summary-type analyses can go. The material on Paul Jenkins’ run belongs in the Publication section, alo",0

I am not a legal expert, but trying to put too much detail in the legal section will be difficult since only actual court cases in each jurisdiction will decide whether bitcoin is illegal in that jurisdiction or not. For example: it is stated above: """"The claim that bitcoin is """"illegal"""" in Indonesia is based on the warning of the Bank Indonesia, which claimed that bitcoin is not a """"legal medium of exchange in Indonesia"""". Thus, bitcoin is legal as long as you do not use it as a medium of exchange. You can thus legally mine it and legally buy it outside Indonesia and hoard it in the country. It is legal, as long as you do not use it as a medium of exchange. Similarly, intricate and complicated legal arguments can most probably be made for all statements regarding the legality of bitcoin in each jurisdiction in the world. This article is clearly not the space to get bogged down in these legal matters. Perhaps this should be stated as a preamble to this section. Obviously referencing newspaper articles about the legality or not of bitcoin in a country may be encyclopedic, but may be far from correct in terms of the actual legal status in a jurisdiction. Most probably not many courtcases regarding this matter have been decided by now. The correct way would be to only allow references to courtcases deciding these legal matters in each jurisdiction.

Thank you for this.  I have reviewed the policies regarding content disputes.  I have issued a message to the user I have a content dispute with to see if we can come to a resolution.  I have specifically indicated to them that so long as they source Mazahery's opposition to the complaint that was filed against her, then it would make sense to post comments to that effect.  I have also explained to them that lawsuits are public, so if Mazahery did file an opposition and present evidence in her defense, then the user should have access.  If the matter escalates, what should we do?

"Mary Ambrose was not Robert Palmer's girlfriend at the time of his death, although they had been involved in a casual relationship. However, during the time period that Mary Ambrose was involved with Robert Palmer, she was involved with a number of men, even having two children, in 2001 and 2002, with men known to Robert Palmer. Mary Ambrose's son born in 2001 was fathered by Mick Carter, who was Robert Palmer's manager, until Palmer fired him in the second week of September. Unfortunately, since Mick Carter was the first person to discover that Robert Palmer had died, he took the opportunity to lie to the press on a number of points, including naming Mary Ambrose as Robert Palmer's girlfriend. Robert Palmer was no longer involved with Mary Ambrose before his death. His only contact with her at that point was trying to iron out a settlement agreement with Ambrose ensuring that she would not give interviews about him, or discuss him with the press. Mick Carter was not fond of Robert's true girlfriend, in fact he disliked her intently. Robert Palmer hadn't told many people about Mick Carter's firing, opting to complete his publicity appearances in Paris for Drive before doing so. Carter was fully aware of this, and took advantage of the situation. When it was discovered what he had done, and the surfeit of bogus and incorrect information that he had provided to the press worldwide, the information was invalidated due to his firing and credibility issues. Because of his close friendship with Mary Ambrose, he saw a money making opportunity for them in Robert Palmer's death. Carter even went so far as to stage a 'hoax' interview on Mary Ambrose's behalf, entitled Robert Palmer Was Addicted To My Love. The article appeared on the 28th of September, two days after the death of Palmer. The interview allegedly took place by phone, backed up by a signed release. When the interview was challenged by the family as being false, the interview was basically Robert Palmer emoting about Mary Ambrose, who his children knew he was no longer involved with in any vernacular at the time of his death, the article was revealed to be a hoax. At the time Robert Palmer was allegedly giving this interview by phone, he was in fact in attendance at a social function accompanied by three friends of his, who vouched he was with them the entire time the interview was allegedly taking place. As for the release, it was proven that Robert Palmer's signature was forged, and not a very good forgery at that. The article was to appear in three parts, but once the publishers realized that the article was a hoax, they cancelled the publication of the other two parts of the article and invalidated the one part that they had ran.",0

"The origins are very obscure. The Bedouin Arabs, who were the original followers of Mohammed and responsible for the first islamic conquests in Syria, Palestine, and Persia, were a nomadic people who lived in tents. In the cities they conquered they began by converting old buildings, and christian churches became mosques; in damascus a pagan temple transformed into a Christian church was incorporated into the Great Mosque (706-15). The earliest and one of the most beautiful of islamic buildings is the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem, built as a sanctuary (not as a mosque)[there's some debate about this] on a circular plan (685-705, but much altered later, especially in 1561 when the exterior was cased in Persian tiles and the interior lined with marble). The first minarets were converted church towers in Syria, and that built a Kairouan, Tunisia (724-7), is modelled on such a tower. True to their nomadic origins the Umayyad rulers preferred desert residences to town palaces. Several survive in ruins - Qasr al-Hair (728-9); Mshatta near Amman, Jodania; and Qasr at-Tuba in the Wadi Ghadorf near Amman. In plan these groups of buildings were derived from Roman frontier stations. Both religious and secular buildings of the period incorporate elements which were to become distinguishing features of islamic architecture: The horseshoe arch, tunnel vaults of stone and brick, rich surface decoration in carved stone, mosaic, and painting. During the Umayyad period the mosque took its permanent architectural for, dictated by liturgical needs - minarets from which the faithful could be called to prayer; a wide courtyard with a central fountain for ablutions, with surrounding colonnades to give protection from the sun; a large praying chamber, marked externally by a dome (as a sign of importance) and internally by the mihrab or niche indicating the direction of Mecca, towards which the faithful must turn in prayer. The last survivor of the Umayyad dynasty became the founder of the Emirates at Cordoba in Spain, where the early style of Islamic architecture was brought to perfection in the Great Mosque (786-990)
Under the Abassids who surplanted the Umayyads in 750, Persian influence began to dominate the Islamic world. The main achievements in architecture were the foundation of the new capital at Baghdad, built on a circular plan (762-7, now largely destroyed) and, slightly later, the smaller city of Raqqa, Syria of which little survives except its richly decorated gateways. It was at this period that Islamic architecture began to depart radically from Hellenistic and Byzantine conventions. An elaborate court etiquette, derived from persia and contrary to Bedouin ideas of informality, was introduced, and palaces were designed for the new caliphs on more formal and grandiose lines, e.g. the palaces of Ukhaidir and Samarra in Iraq. These large buildings were run up very quickly; stone was abandoned in favour of brick and there was much use of decorative stucco. The main C9 achievements were the great mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia (836); the mosque of Bu Fatata, Susa, Tunisia (850-1); the Great Mosque of Samarra, Iraq with its strange ziggurat-like minaret (c850) and the very well preserved mosque of Inb Tulun, Cairo (876-7). Buidling materials were usually rough but dressed with intricate geometrical or floral surface decorations in painted stucco, mosaic, glazed tiles, or shallow relief carving. Local traditions influenced the decorative styles in various regions (See Indian pakistan, persian and turkish architecture)
''In the original nucleus of the Islamic world the most notable later mosques are those a Tabriz, Persia (1204), Cairo (Mosque of Sultan Barquq 1384) and Isfahan Persia (1585). Most of the earlier religious builings, including the Masjid-el-aksa and the dome of the rock in jerusalem, were also altered and more richly decorated in these centuries. In southern spain a local style of great oppulence was developed; it's principle monuments are the Giralda tower, Seville (1159) and the Alhambra (1309-54)",0

Or epistemology. Or logic.  We can thank Dewey and the Pragmatists for that.  But I digress. 
While an autodidact (notice the second 'd') is defined as a self-taught person, it is not necessarily the case the reverse is true. 
But we are also talking about connotation and a quirk about English grammar. When you say a person """"is self-taught"""", because taught is in the past tense, it gives the impression of being in the past. It is also ambiguous, as people are likely to say/think/ask, """"self-taught in what?""""  But if you say a person is an autodidact, it maintains the present tense and does not suggest when the self-teaching occurred.  It also implies a general sense of being self-taught. For instance, I taught myself how to program computers. But I don't go around claiming I'm an autodidact. With Langdon, if you say he is """"self-taught"""" and mention his IQ and status as a bouncer, well, that hardly gives a meaningful impression. 
For that reason it's as I stated earlier  an approach to learning. Langan is generally self-taught (or something like that), but more critically, I think, his attitude seems to be """"why should I bother learning from someone who is my intellectual inferior"""". That's the impression I got from the video interview. 
Having said that, I assume someone else did call him an autodidact, right? Because if not, then the whole thing is OR.

"Why would anyone use a noise weighting curve to assess hearing damage? That would indeed be stupid, as there is no reason at all to suppose that there is any correlation between apparent loudness and damage.

"I think all Wikipedia Nobel Prize lists must be augmented by this crucial  information. This will also put in perspective the recent inflation of Nobel laureates in the sciences, which is easy to explain: most of the recent laureates had to share the prize while most of the early laureates got a full prize.  The lists of laureates by university or by country must take this into account as well. For example, Glauber (US), Hall (US) and Hänsch (Germany) shared the physics prize of 2005. But we cannot simply add 2.00 points to the US count and 1.0 to the German count. Instead we have to add 0.75 to the US count and 0.25 to the German count (Hänsch and Hall each got only 0.25 of the prize, Glauber got 0.5). Otherwise we'd violate the Nobel Prize conservation law:  The sum of the Nobel Prizes per year is constant; you may divide it among many laureates, but then the laureates necessarily become less outstanding on average.",0

 NPOV again 

First of all, I'm Brazilian and PRO Lula. I want a more neutral article. Not all the people in Brazil, I know, like him. But not all the people hate him. Every one knows what NPOV means, it would be rather a Multiple Point of view. So, criticism and good things must come together. Althou, Wikipedia cannot agree with bias, hate or fanatism.
Here is a list of some alterations I made and a bit of opinion:

 Biography: it is alright. It is a standart biography...
 Elections... """"In the second round of the 2002 election, (...) and became the president of Brazil."""" instead of """"to become the president-elect of Brazil"""". Just a bit of grammar.3
 The Government - Political Orientation: some time before, I transfered a piece of text about the radical-left-wing of PT from this article to PT's article. I DID NOT DELETED it. I just put it in a better place, because it is not a personal problem of Lula, but a problem for the party. Every one agree? The external links about it i tranfered to PT's article, too.
 The Government - Reforms and Important Laws. When I first wrote it I put each item as a section (I was pretending to write a piece of text for each one). It was oversized and so, following a sugestion, I changed it in a list. All right?
 Deleted: """"Unfortunately, there has been no control over the program on behalf of the government and """"Bolsa Família"""" has been transformed into mere populism."""" - It is not the common sense. It is a political point of view of an action of the government. Populism is a dangerous word that must be avoided.

 Problem with pakis. 

Well the real problem with pakis is that they are the coward individuals, they are the race of cowards, Why? Let me elucidate it, when muslims came to INDIA only those cowards change there religion(From Hinduism & sikhism mainly) who are afraid of them as they will beat them, whereas hindus & sikhs(those who choose not to change there religion due to fear) confronted them with power.Due to this reason pakis are not able to even talk confidently as there is always a complex in there mind about this.pakis are the opportunists always seeking ways to bleed INDIA (there Motherland too),But they are failed to realise this that we are the same people ,if we can fight with the might of englishmen then we can rip apart the pakis.Freedom is given by INDIAN nationalists to INDIA, when they saw this happening then they(jinnah etc.) form a plan(As the are opportunists) to divide INDIA as this will satify there need to have a grater share in power.Then jinnah himself said when he is about to die that """"pakistan is the biggest blunder of my life"""".Pakis are now killing poor balochs as balochs are resisting pakis attempt to exploit the land through various lollypops like gwadar port etc.But as a nation created by dividing the land they should now make up there mind as further 2 or 3 divisions of pak is inevitable.""""Pakis"""" your fate is written all over the wall - read it and accept it.""",0

""" the mother carries her kittens. It should also point out that the behaviour links to mating as well. During mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck, and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a 'ready' posture, when not in heat or even male cats, when grasped by the scruff. 62.49.6.17  
I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid. The ITIS webpage has no entry at all for Felis silvestris catus, not even to call it invalid. Felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature. I draw this from scholar.google.com: 
From 1982-1991, 0 uses of Felis silvestris catus, many uses of Felis silvestris f catus'' whatever that notation means.

His badgering continues on the entry talk page without apology or any shred of anything to substantiate his offensive comment. 

To have User:scray come along and say stuff like """" Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, name-calling (a personal attack) won't go well.""""  I did not call a name. I called a spade a spade and gave good evidence that I was calling it as it presented itself.

 I'd be happy to work on the lead (or for anyone else to have a go at it), and any suggestions for improvement are always welcome, but it seems absurd for an FA not to have an FA class rating from a related project.  Basically, you're saying your standards are different from community consensus as determined through the FAC (and, in this case, FAR) processes. The two ratings in the mathematics project's grading scheme that are not subjective are FA and GA.  In this case, rather than attempt to unilaterally downgrade the article I think a better approach might have been to raise the issues you see on the talk page (or simply fix them).  In the future if you're hesitant to """"sign"""" an FA or GA rating, then perhaps you should add the rating but not sign it.

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the """"data of consciousness"""" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding. There are Lonergan Centers at Boston College, University of Toronto, Seton Hall, and Loyola Marymount University devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology. I'm quite sure nearly every philosophy professor at any Jesuit schools would consider his work """"notable"""".

Also, what I mean by 'attacking' Italy-related articles is that many people seem to not want pages to change and there is constant edit-wars, reverting and deleting. Rather than deleting disputable info, I believe that it is better to improve it, rather than revertion. As I've only edited a few Italian articles, it could be only concerning those pages, but that's what I see in that.

Ok, let's just leave the intro as it is now. If you want sources for the info you deleted, I could go and find some.

 Well, I'll give you my opinion. I wrote the Intervals section, and I admit that I didn't write it well at all. It was one of my first Wiki contribs, and it sucked quite honestly. I would encourage someone to re-write it if they want to, or I will when I have time to mull it over and do it properly. However, as far as the specific point over whether it relates to the article: harmony cannot exist without intervals. When two distinct (by which I mean different) pitches are sounded, the interval between them is what creates harmony. Harmony and interval relationships are inseparable, because they're one and the same. So absolutely, a section explaining intervals is relevant. However, the way in which I went about explaining it in my contrib wasn't so great. Again, I would encourage a competent and learned musician to do a re-write, or wait and I'll do it.  

 I will say one other thing, which is that Wikipedia is a learning reference, and will serve its best use to the public if Average Joe can come along and glean complete information from non-confusing articles. My ideal is this: say a churchgoing person, one who has very limited musical knowledge, wants to learn how to sing the alto/tenor/bass/whatever line in hymns, so that he/she can feel more """"one with God"""" on Sunday mornings. I want for that person to be able to look at this article, and come away with a clear idea of how harmonies work, so that he/she can practice singing them. The oneand onlything which creates the alto, tenor, and bass lines are the fact that they're pitched at an interval to the melody (soprano) line. Again, intervals and harmonies are one and the same. For the large percentage of the population who struggles with learning things """"by ear"""", a comfortably firm understanding of interval relationships is (along with practice thereafter) the magic key to unlocking the ability to """"hear"""" (discern) harmonies. That's why I think it's important to keep the section in question, but to rewrite it.  """,0

Unless you think you're a lexicographer, relying on the dictionary immunizes yourself from charges of POV.
Now that it looks like some reform is gonna stick, I am much less unsatisfied than I was when I came upon the article back in June or whenever.  But it is clunky, designed by committee.  I had hoped that enough of you guys would understand the importance of defining time, on the outset, as these two different (and not really competing) definitions, first as a phenomenon (where I drew every word out of the dictionary references, including """"indefinite"""" and """"existence"""", etc.) and then as a measurement (what Steve Quinn likes to call the """"operational"""" definition).  And I had hoped that, because measurement is done both with clocks we build (to measure time in material reality) and with our conscious experience (which is debated among philosophers and lay people as to whether or not that is contained in material reality or is somehow different) that you guys (with the exceptions of SQ and JW) would see the wisdom of not jamming them together in a run-on sentence and see the wisdom of setting up the topic in all three major POVs: Time as phenomenon, Time as physical measurement, Time as experience right away in two lede sentences.  Everything else in the article will fall under one of those three; """"religion, philosophy, and science... business, industry, sports, the sciences, music, dance, and the live theater"""".  I am convinced that the professor would grade my lede definition higher than what is there now, and far better than what was there before.  Too bad.  But the status quo isn't better than what existed before and since I was unsuccessful (even though everything is solidly referenced) in convincing you, I'll let it go.  Unless SQ or JW try to crap up the lede again, then I'll be back, and the rest of us also should be vigilant.  Maybe someday, this will be a good article.

I agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated.  

In addition, pls stop edit warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, etc.  

And add to the list Matt Guerrier.  It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  

It has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnación and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  
Run batted in says: """"The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"""". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.
@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a """"|"""" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.
It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  (t / c) 

Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).

Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, """"RBI"""" is used for either singular """"Run Batted In"""" or plural """"Runs Batted In"""". """"RBIs"""" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.

Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  

Jackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with """"at bat""""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.  

 Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) .

 As for """"thorough treatment"""", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue.

 In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb.

DOUBLE STANDARDS & NOT BEING NEUTRAL

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia and """"WHOVILLE"""" since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”.

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.

"law vs conscience 

The Law has no authority over anyone because the law is a thing. A thing has no power, no rights and no authority. It can’t speak, hear or feel. The Law was instituted by those that are powerful and wealthy as a form of their own protection. They that formed the Law have also designed loopholes so that they may escape the penalty of that Law. They are the Lawless ones. The knowledge of Good and Evil produces a conscience in us. By having a conscience we all feel guilt. 
The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil produced a conscience in us. If you look at the story of Adam and Eve you will notice as soon as they ate off the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil that they became ashamed, worried, confused and guilty. When the Lord said, “If you eat of this tree you shall die,” You will die because of your guilt. Before that event took place we had no conscience much like unreasoning animals, no guilt. Look at the animals, they just exist not knowing good and evil. 
Before long humans started forming a legal system from this knowledge. This legal system is still forced on us today. It is known as government or civilizations. We belong to a civilized world. We must reject it. To gain access to the Tree of life we must eliminate the standard that we have created civilization with. The Law. The Law forces us to be guilty. It takes away peace in the world. The knowledge of good and evil and the fruit of it which is the Law, is standing in the way of the Tree of Life. It is an abominable thing. Our conscience must rule over us not the Law.",0

Noether's Theorem
Okay. Is there a simple way to derename a page?  

I don't know one - but then I'm hardly an expert on the technical side.

 

If no one has edited the redirect created by the move, the page can just be moved back as if there was no page already there, which is what I've done as the original move broke a number of redirects and didn't seem to follow naming conventions. . 11:40, May 2, 2004 (UTC)

Fatou, Julia and Mandelbrot sets
Charles, thanks for tidying up the page I created on Pierre Fatou and looking up his born/died dates. In a later edit you added a comment about Mandelbrot sets being the popular name for Julia Sets. They are actually quite different; I updated the article with a more detailed description of the relationship between the work Fatou did, Julia's work and how this relates to the later work by Mandelbrot. The Mandelbrot set actually classifies the Julia sets - points in the Mandelbrot set have a connected Julia set and points not in the Mandelbrot set don't. The extra research was quite interesting as Julia and Fatou were coming up with their ideas at the same time and their theories were so similar, they are now referred to as the 'Fatou-Julia Theorem'.

Coase Theorem

Go ahead and change it back to lowercase if you want, but it's definitely uppercase in an economics textbook I have. I personally seem to see more capitalized than uncapitalized theorems, and I think the convention at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (theorems) is flawed (I definitely see """"Pythagorean Theorem"""" more often than I see """"Pythagorean theorem""""), but I'm not going to go against everyone else on this. In any case, thanks for letting me know about this (it's much nicer to see people like you than people who just overwrite other people's changes without any attempt at all at discussion).  01:12, May 5, 2004 (UTC)

You made a major edit to a page that had already had a great deal of work done it - without discussion. Obviously, the old page wasn't perfect.

In other words, you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue, on a different page (EURO), in part by employment of your ham-handed authority to shut me down for a few days, which you did 6 months ago.

In part, this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue:  They were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority, they didn't find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know, DEBATE.

I wanted to be a touch more exact on some of the parts for Mugen’s character. He’s such an interesting character that even though he is almost purely made up out of the minds of the creators, he still has a few bits of actual historical pertinence to him.

The part I’m addressing now is the interesting way in which he comes back to life by meeting the “Shamans” as referred to in his character profile. In the Okinawan belief system, these shamans are called “futuki” and they are the only spirits from the other world who intercede into human affairs.

These beings are generally thought to be an individual's own direct ancestors (both male and female), and the same individual's future descendants (which makes it kind of interesting that Mugen has a center place in the ongoing line of them; maybe there is something to the theory that Spike is his descendant...). Anyway, the futuki are generally masked and wear feathered cloaks, and are indistinguishable from each other, at least in this world. During one of the many interesting flashback montage’s, we see not only the long line of them, but one watching Mugen from the road through the forest, and a couple of other spots, which suggests to me that he's someone they're keeping an eye on. It would make sense by traditional Okinawan beliefs but it is pure speculation on my part.

The feathered apparel particularly have always made me wonder about that tropical looking red bird that seems to observe Mugen so closely in that grove; maybe another spirit observer? And it might also be interesting to note that the underworld where he deals with the futuki, Nirai-kanai, is represented in Okinawan folklore as an island you can only reach by swimming underwater; if you try to sail there it'll always be on the horizon no matter how far you go. I think that's why everything there appears upside down, you have to """"sink to rise"""" there, so to speak; and Mugen """"falls back to the surface"""" when he leaves that place.

 Power Station Vandalism 

I am writing to question you of your suspected involvement in a vandalism attack on a local power station in Reading, England.

This is not the only occasion in which your Wikipedia account has been referenced.

The initial aim failed, they never were able to reach the roof; however, their banner was slung over a nearby house for all to see.

Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me.

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed.

This is your talk page so I will not put that other post back up as you have deemed it worthy to censor me on your private page.

Here's a thought. You probably never contemplated that your actions against NLP would one day back fire against you such that your own dream model (and consequence business) will brought down (at best) or reduced (at worst). As I have and am continuing to zealously write to and track down every organisation you have advanced this model to, it stands to reason that you will not be getting any contract renewed. I am operating covertly, so these organisations will be writing back to me, giving me a chance to create doubt (nothing evil, much of it will be what I said to you). 

Why do I reveal my strategy to you?

1. You will find out anyway from different government bodies.

2. There is no fun in not telling you. This whole effort on my part takes an incredible lot of time and I must have fun!

3. I will never do anything evil. Everything I advance is the truth, backed by logic not emotion, in the interests of academic fair play.

You see, you can Not criticise """"another model"""" whilst concurrently advancing a mystic model yourself. Therein lays the problem and fallacy you play with. I would have no problem in you criticising NLP over the years if you were not therefore advancing a equally mystic model ! But [1] Cynefin and [2] your rejection of everything Richard Dawkins (and therefore Darwin) makes you de facto a mystic in the widest terms! As for """"2"""" you believe the lack of """"any"""" evidence is proof positive of a """"significant and massive"""" proposition [that fails every test of existence using science] As for [1] you seriously believe that whereas Nobel Laureates have not figured out and are in argument about Complexity Science, that """"you"""" have figured it out in relation to human interaction and action ! Do you see how laughable this is ? Seriously - you are an intelligent man, you do understand """"cognitive bias"""" , don't you ? You have been sucked into confirmation bias, whilst failing the test of logic. How can """"you"""" know """"complexity science"""" when they do Not even know this well enough at the Santa Fe institute ? You would Never even get an audience there and if you did, they [academics] would tear you apart. Do you agree ?

I've just skimmed this drivel  I really don't have much time for it  and noticed comments by CLIFTONIAN. I need to apologize to this man. 

I got out of Pattani towards the end of Ramadam and spent a few days in Singapore. Ramadam this year in Pattani was tough (Google """"Pattani Bomb"""" to see what I mean, and perhaps look at the IMAGES, too). I got back to Pattani on Friday (the start of HARI RAYA) and had a few drinks. We all did. This was when I wrote my final comments. 

Yep  what I did was wrong. I had no right to disrupt CLIFTONIAN's review. Being slightly drunk is not an excuse.

Well all right, at least we are getting some debate on the subject.

Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a """"revolutionary design"""" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial """"flat turret"""" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped """"hexagonal turret"""" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.

As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  

Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.

DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text """"awful"""", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:

1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie """"Alexander Nevsky"""", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.

2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.

But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.

Word count is not a measure of informative content.  It's supposed to be a concise encyclopedic article about arborsculpture, now being referred to by consensus (this I assume) as tree shaping.  It's not a book. It's not supposed to be a how-to manual.  It's not """"battle of the sculptors and the finer fractional points of their methods,"""" nor is it a debate on whose artistic technique is more pure, nor whose book is more popular or true, nor who sells more mirrors.  I strove for neutrality, well aware of the ongoing editing issues among the (IMO) way-too-involved author/editor/artist/arborists who currently monitor this page.  For just a single sticky example, waxing on about one's own (or someone elses) worldwide acclaim is not only not encyclopedic, it's unseemly.  It is made immeasurably more so by adding copious and ever-more-poorly formatted references to the insisted acclaim.  Further, there are several sections I haven't yet hammered at, that need it.  Most particularly the protracted sections comparing arborsculpture to (and from this reader's perspective, defending it from encroachment by) each and every other horticultural art & practice.  These sorts of writing read tensely and uncomfortably, like an argument, detracting from the fascinating topic. There may indeed be too many images for the text.

"===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=

Dear Tiptoety,

I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.

This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. 

It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  

Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  

the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  

Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:

“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”
Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? 

The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u",0

I've seen the statement that """"JavaScript doesn't support private members"""" too often to be funny - even on this page before I edited that out. Stating in the article that JavaScript supports private members eliminates this misconception, but you need a code sample to prove your point. Since people can actually see with their own eyes how it works this adds to the credibility of the article. So you want to discuss closures? If you don't mention them, the article fails to mention one of the defining properties of JavaScript. If you do mention them, the shortest and cleanest way to explain the concept is through a code sample. As long as we structure the information in an appropriate way we need not necessarily be afraid that we've got too much of it.  """,0

"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).
 

 period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

As to """"The issue was put to a vote on TMB"""" allow me to resurrect an archived discussion: 
The founder discussion starts here with a poll in which 11 persons voted and 9 agreed that Irvine was the Originator of the movement (as opposed to Architect, author, creator, Father or inventor of the movement, which names all received 0 votes, or the Entrepreneur or Maker of the movement, which names received 1 vote each). Although the topic of the poll and subsequent messages is """"Founder"""" the term """"Founder"""" was not included as an option on the poll.

This message thread is 20 pages long  556 messages. So long in fact that a second thread called Founder part II was started. That thread is 1750+ messages long. More than a dozen is an understatement: 20 unique posters appear on the first two pages of part II. Even a cursory reading, however, shows that a consensus has not been reached. As late as yesterday this message appeared. It's pretty clear that the same faith-inspired contentiousness evidenced by Members who are editing this article is reflected on TMB as well even now. RSuser is disingenuous to assert that a consensus exists on TMB which should be reflected here even if it contradicts documented facts.

Would it be possible to suggest that religion (according to Cicero, from Latin  re- """"again"""" + legere """"read"""") is a human survival strategy which allows those within to co-operate in securing their future - sometimes at the expense of their neighbors' survival. 

Hence th prohibition about killing and the 'just war' philosophy. It is significant that the scriptural (i.e. written) Judaic origin of the world and the garden of Eden is closely linked to the time and place (Ur was around Basra in modern Iraq) where writing was invented. The peripatetic Jewish nation  invaded Palestine (land of the Philistines) after, and their holy writings record much of this.

d) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was never financially successful, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. They were dropped by Sire Records that same year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly execptional mother Charlotte Lesher. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced.

Please tell me does wikipedia allow ADMINS to hold a biased one sided opinion? When SIKH HISTORY admin have openly declared adherence to a strict orthodox viewpoint, you as MOD should really be enforcing wikipedias own rules on your own admin. You unblocking me is secondry to the blatent disregard for wikipedia rules on diet in sikhism. So its NOT MY truth that i hold, its wikikpedia rules that i hold, which YOU disregard. Now you have barred me, because you deem me argument on integrity an attack on ADMIN, when i have repeated over and over again, its an ISSUE of an article which is purely one sided. Now does wikipedia allow blatant disregard of rules from their own ADMIN? 

From the same scholar, same book, same ISBN NUMBER, one rejected and one accepted, the accepted statement fits in with the ADMINS own orthodox stance which he has openly declared on his Wikipedia page. 

1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are, 

“passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.",0

Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Ittō-ryū.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as """"judo"""" or """"kenjutsu"""") is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's """"official"""" name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Ittō-ryū should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included """"Kenjutsu"""" after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use """"Aikijujutsu"""" as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) """"Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu"""".

Regarding the hyphen in """"aiki-jujutsu"""", I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with """"aikijujutsu"""", because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes """"aikijujutsu"""" readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to """"aikijujutsu"""", if anyone feels strongly about it.  """,0

Dear Aucaman, I was a bystander during last few months watching your edits and other Kurdish wikipedians' edits  and associated discussions,  without interfereing. I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes. I voted and I take the responsibility for it. If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups. National heros, prophets, Gods etc are things that we should comment very carefully on them. Besides, you are by no means an expert on these issues. About your alleged ethnicity, it is not important whether you are Persian or Kurd, Iranian or Russian. You need to revise your views. If you were persian, you would need an even more extensive revision. This is only a suggestion and my personal viewpoint.

My argument is that your claim is soapboxing, something not supported in the sources.  There are no sources that say those other ideologies are """"just as diverse"""".  Besides, the issue isn't about diversity, it's about how related they are, whether all the ideologies have common roots from which they all evolved, or whether they have distinct unrelated sources.   The complete dearth of sources describing any one of those other ideological labels as being comprised of distinct ideologies with original unrelated sources is telling.  They are not """"just as diverse"""".  What is deficient about this argument?  It makes no reliance on all sources about libertarianism making this observation.  By the way, referring to the distinct ideologies as """"variants"""" does not preclude the possibility of them being distinct with separate/unrelated origins.No one is questioning the complexity of Conservatism et. al.

 Follow-up re new medal icons for medals tables 

Well, this has been finally implemented, and I think the new icons are a radical improvement over the previous color blocks.  The medals table of Nicole Haislett looks remarkably cleaner and more graphically refined, and we may now replace many of the artificially abbreviated place names and event descriptions that were previously employed to avoid line-wrapping within the medals tables.  A couple of points remain to be discussed and resolved:

  how do we handle the graphics for the """"disqualified"""" medal option?
  what do we do about the winner, runner-up and playoff options that were engrafted onto this template by an association football editor in 2011?

I'm bringing these issues here first, SFB, because you (a) are obviously not opposed to change, and (b) have a good eye for better graphics.  I would like to get on the same page with you before starting another template talk page discussion.

My suggestion for the """"disqualified"""" issue would be to fill square area surrounding the circular medal icon with a percentage screen of red, with a red diagonal bar drawn across the icon itself  that screams intuitive.  The disqualified option should also include a field for explanatory footnote text.  Another simpler alternative is to omit disqualified medals altogether.

As for the winner, runner-up and playoffs options for association football/soccer, I seriously question whether these should be included in a """"medals"""" table at all.  Having looked at several dozen footballer infoboxes that use these options, it also appears that many uses are for minor regional, national and subnational tournaments.  Frankly, I wonder if WP:FOOTY has even sanctioned many of these minor tournament outcomes for inclusion; most of them do not appear to be medal competitions, so the use of the gold, silver and bronze background colors is inaccurate.

"Introductory Paragraphs
The intro paragraphs are good, but they could be a lot better.  I think that right now there's too much of a technical sound to it, as opposed to something more educational and inviting to people trying to learn about the subject.  I'd just like you to compare/contrast with the following paragraph, which is how evolution is introduced in a Bio101 textbook:

(Fair use excerpts follows)
Evolution originated with Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species...He argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species.  Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution which he termed natural selection, the idea that organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals.  ..In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution.  But we can also use the termin evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of the biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.

An understanding of evolution informs every field of biology, and applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and conservation...Evolution integrates all of biology.
(above is for example purposes onlywe can't use this in the article.)

We can't use the above since it would be fair-use, but do you see what I mean about making the article more accessible?

Another thing I'd note about the above example is that it also makes Evolution sound more exciting.  Just because we are an encyclopedia doesn't mean we can't put the subject in the exciting, important context that it deserves.

We could use something closer to the above, and then dive into a description of how the Theory of Evolution (what you might call a description of the fact of evolution that's described above) has developed from Darwin's original theory to modern-day explanations (and at the same time state how the question of whether evolution occurs has been a relatively incontroversial fact amongst biologists for the better part of a century).",0

I forgot what note it is but it would have to be C2 for her range to be 5 octaves which it isnt. However they can stay since this category seems useless and not very well varified.

Another worthy editor, with whom I disagree about his recent editing of what I first wrote six months ago actually gives the best evidence that clarification of the word uphold is appropriate (if not in fact needed) in this article.

As you can read above, he states on this discussion page[] that no clarification of the word “uphold” is needed because it is such a simple word (he says “If people are smart enough to access Wikipedia, they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word. I'm willing to concede all of your other points, but I will continue to revert your changes if you insist on adding the word approved  twice, no less  to clarify the elementary word """"uphold"""" [emphasis added]). 

Yet, even this intelligent and well-expressed editor was confused as to the meaning. When he first edited (by removing “(approved)” as a clarification of the word “upheld”), he did so NOT because it was a commonly understood word that was incapable of being misunderstood, as he now says it is. No, his reason was the complete opposite. He changed it because, at that time, he misunderstood the meaning of the word. In his own explanation of the edit (on the revision history page [] for this article)[] he wrote his reason for removing the word “approved,” stating on December 23 the following “21:20, 23 December 2009  (upholding is different from approving [emphasis added]).”[]

He changed it because he thought the words had different meanings. He understands now, but has [briefly, no doubt, as can we all] forgotten that people, as did he, can misunderstand these terms. He is also correct that I did put that clarification twice. I did so because it seemed appropriate when I sought to present the information in a suitably short, yet accurate, fashion. However, it is rather obvious that even twice isn’t enough clarification for every time that every reader reads something. This is true for us all, even editors who take of their own time in an effort to improve Wikipedia articles.

The other editor says “If people are smart enough to access Wikipedia, they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word.” I disagree. Respectfully, even intelligent editors can, and this instance, did misunderstand what they thought was an incredibly common and elementary word such as “upheld.” Please understand that this is not a personal attack in any way, and that everyone’s opinion and thoughtful efforts at editing are valuable. It’s just that the circumstances are that the very person who now says that the clarification is so completely inappropriate here that he will continue to remove such clarification every time in the future that it is restored, is the same person who originally took out the explanation - not because it wasn’t needed, but rather, because he didn’t himself understand what the term meant. We are all human. We are all learning.

The other editor is hardly alone in being human. The reason that I could quickly find so many examples of clarification of the same term, coincidently done in the same manner, is that the term (upheld) is worth using (it has a precise meaning, especially to those in the legal field), but it i",0
"""Memorizing Melodic Sequences ==

Another neglected area is a method for memorizing unfamiliar sequences of notes. For example, a long guitar solo that a student is trying to transcribe. Interval training is fine but the ability to internalize and recognize a series of tones as """"music"""" is just as important. As one of the posters noted above, internalizing music through listening and ear training is neglected in most acedemic programs. What most teachers call natural talent might be easily learned if these principles where taught.

 Avoid Song Removal 

Anyone who feels the need to edit the page by removing a song from the list because it is not 'popular' enough, please consider that the value of the list is how well known it is to the student, not how popular it is overall, and what is not well known to you may be rather familiar to someone else.

If you still feel the need, please document the removal in the discussion pages.  That way, if someone legitimately disagrees with your decision, at least it's easier to find the deleted entry than in the history pages, and the reasoning behind the removal. 

  

I'd recommend, rather than feeling the need to remove a song, if there's nothing you recognize, find a song you think people would know that features the same interval. The songs you know will probably be different from those I know.

Hi  - Yes I do really believe there is a rational explanation for why these types of cults exist in the US but are unknown elsewhere. 
In what universe is it """"offensive"""" to state the simple objective fact that such cults are crackpot? Are you seriously proposing that David Koresh and his followers were perfectly rational and sane? What makes you think Jim Jones was no different from any mainstream Methodist/Presbyterian/Baptist/Lutheran minister?

 Add-in of old material or add to new page 

This edit was definately a great improvement, the only thing is it stripped out some information that I think was good. How about we add some of it back in or add some of it to start a new artcile Goddard Space Flight Center Facilities or List of facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center or something like that. Comments? Here is the material that was taken out on that edit:

West Campus
The West Campus contains buildings that support administration, research, design and construction of spacecraft, operation of spacecraft, information storage and archival, and data analysis. The buildings generally are two to three stories high, often brick, and simply detailed. Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:
The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. 
The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. 
The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. 
The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. 
The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.
The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.
The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed """"The SES"""") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. 
The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. 
The Spacecraft Fabrication Facility where Goddard technicians and engineers manufacture components used for spacecraft assembly. This includes the tools which the astronauts use in space as well as the spacecraft themselves.
The Building 29 Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility is a 7990 m² facility that contains one of the largest cleanrooms in the world. The High Bay Cleanroom is a , class 1,000 (M4.5), horizontal flow cleanroom measuring 30.5 x 38 x 27 meters (100'x125'x89'). Its five {{con",0

 Re. #1: I'm not sure what you mean by """"different ground"""". They differ in their POV: While Notable assassinations of the Sri Lankan Civil War is written according to WP:NPOV, Assassinations and murders attributed to the LTTE is functionally a WP:POV fork. (I say """"functionally"""" because it historically preceded the other article, so it hasn't been created with that intention. However, I feel that the decision to keep a POV version in addition to an NPOV version amounts functionally to the same as creating a POV fork.) That is certainly not a reason to keep the latter.

 Re. #2 & #3: I assume you're talking about WP:SIZE. There is absolutely no reason to be worried about that:
 WP:SIZE is not a policy, but a guideline, so it the statement """"itis agaisnt wikipedia policy"""" is simply wrong.
 The guideline says: """"Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 6,000 to 10,000 words"""". The article body currently has 935 words, so we're not even close by any stretch of the imagination. 
 Even if we were close, the guideline specifically says: No need for haste.
 Even if we were beyond the recommandation, there are many other ways to split articles. Splitting it by POV is not the way to do it. 

 In conclusion, I am not convinced by any of the arguments; I don't see any benefit for Wikipedia if we kept the """"... LTTE"""" article. 

 Since this is not an official mediation, and since the three opposing editors have not applied for WP:SLR membership, I have no mandate or obligation to represent them. Nevertheless, I want to regard their needs. The fact that we see some unconvincing arguments could indicate that there are other, unexpressed, needs which the """"... LTTE"""" article satisfies. If that is the case, then there could be more at stake than just a harmless redirect. If that is the case, then I recommend bringing it up on WP:AFD. —  """,0

 Current Speculation 

There has been discussion lately about the appropriateness of this section. I will be going out-of-town for the next 5 days, but in my absence I highly encourage the frequent editors of this section to realize the need (and act upon it) to permanently remove this section. Its existence violates:

  NPOV (nuetral point of view)

- No one can truly say how or even if the listed items will affect voters

Types of bias include:

Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism. 
Corporate bias, including advertising, coverage of political campaigns in such a way as to favor corporate interests, and the reporting of issues to favor the interests of the owners of the news media. 
Class bias, including bias favoring one social class and bias ignoring social or class divisions. 
Political bias, including bias in favor of or against a particular political party or candidate. 
Religious bias, including bias in which one religious viewpoint is given preference over others. 
Sensationalism, which is bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary. This includes the practice whereby exceptional news may be overemphasized, distorted or fabricated to boost commercial ratings. 
Geographical bias which may for example describe a dispute as it is conducted in one country without knowing that the dispute is framed differently elsewhere. 

The presence of this section is biased on several of the basses listed above

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article. 

This article is adversely some ones' political movement.

Please permanently honor my deletion of this section of the article.""",0

I'm indifferent. I have work to do on-wiki, but I also have plenty to do off-wiki.

Your assumption is a wrong one. I wasn't thinking I could convice that dude of my wording.

It's just a stupid error that the vast majority have mistakenly adopted for whatever unexplained reason.

Canadians are Americans.
Mexicans are Americans.
Brazilians are Americans.

However, can I, instead, replace """"American"""" with something like """"U.S. citizen"""" or """"person from the United States of America"""" or """"person from the U.S.A.""""? Maybe that would sound less of what some of those other editors were errantly claiming was """"awkward"""" (for whatever unexplained reason), but still be correct and generally acceptable, wouldn't it?

Macedonians
Hi Realek, sorry if I didn't awnser yesterday, but you seemed a bit angry with me, so I decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down. Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I'll try to awnser your points: 
Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed.
The first part was already there: """"Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia."""" As for the second part, """"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed"""", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were """"invented"""" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it.
Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group
I think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it's only stated that """"Greek Macedonians"""" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans.
Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia
I think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had been
There was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance.
Honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can't help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don't know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia.
In conclusion remember that I only edited Telex's text, without adding new statements.
In my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth's Macedonian Question or Poulton's Who are the Macedonians.
As for Telex, you should remember that it's a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it's a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long. Ciao ;-) """,0

Its been claimed that Mr Eide has legally changed his name to Xavier Von Erck, which appears to be substantiated by the final link in the refs. PJ-critical sites suggest the image of his drivers licence was digitally manipulated, and upon my own inspection, it certainly doesn't look unquestionable. You'd think the guy could take a better picture or scan, especially since the whole goal of posting it appears to be proving his name to people critical of his pseudonymity without any further doubt. Regardless, and to fit with conventions, it may still be appropriate to add a (born Philip John Eide) to this entry or a future entry for Xavier Von Erck.

Sorry to disagree again, but the article in question clearly puts the story forth as what each side says. (Narconon says drugs can be sweated out, doctors say no, etc.) How Dr. Touretzky took the story is not actually relevant, more on that at the end.
There are four basic """"sides"""" depicted in it, on one side Narconon and Scientology on the opposite Science and Ex-members/critics. The stuff on Touretzky's site is supported by the latter, and disputed by the former. To a neutral observer, like the Chronicle, it's a subject of controversy. (That's what ChrisO was saying.)
To explain why Dr. Touretzky's opinion of the story is irrelevant, I'll compare it to a reverse hypothetical situation; lets say Narconon felt that they had been quoted out of context. Both arguments are equally invalid since a paper isn't expected to publish what the subject wants published. (Actually, it's really similar to the lawsuit Barbara Schwarz filed against the Salt Lake City Tribune when they published her story and interview.)  

 On POV expressed in this and related articles on Wikipedia 

Incidentally, this article is an excellent example of the best case scenario of POV in a CoS/Hubbard article. It presents both sides arguments without additional comment by the paper, but unlike the Narconon/CoS claims, proof exists to back the assertions made by science. For example *Narco/tology's belief that all drugs have long longevity in fat, scrambling of 3D pictures, etc. compared to tests on human fat showing otherwise and the 3D picture theory to be unproven.
*Narconon and Scientology are for the purposes of the US Government separate entities and this abbreviation is not meant to imply otherwise. They do however share similar vocabulary and ideas, and when describing these I have chosen to abbreviate.  """,0

"I did not perceived you attempt to discussion, sorry. Actually the article is doing worst possible by the so named “finding of a number only” there estimations which are intentionally increased like the “Centre Against Expulsions” work. Unnecessary you need to point on somebody who is responsible it is enough offensive providing numbers which are subjective and biased. There are official more or less numbers of all nations population killed in WW II. You should start from this, until I know the Germany lost 8.7% of population in it 2 810 000 civilians. Thus it is impossible that the numbers can reach 3 millions during expulsion. Are you count also those who were collaborators of Nazi Germany? Well, …
I ask you to be reasonable. Do not put numbers which are just somebody biased “supposition”. Any way I found only one non-German estimation, which are Cold War effort most probably. Do you have UN or other independent sources regarding this numbers? Instead public “findings” which are very irritating you should look for objective source of information. Private multiplication of possibilities is offending. Do you know it? It is particularly such if you consider that other nations in fact lost much more and were not responsible for spark the hell of war.
In total proportion for one German in the WW II was kill ten people of other nations.
When somebody unleash beware dog who the culprit is? Dog or the person, and this is the case. I do not contradicts that after the WWII could occur lawlessness and lynches. Are you surprised of it? I am not, but you see if in competition during the 80’s the Soviets would invade Poland and Jaruzelski would support it in some way – we would blame Jaruzelski for our deaths in first place. The Soviets we world also, but first and above all Jaruzelski. He was the totalitarian and collaborator. Exactly the Germans should immediately and in first place blame Hitler and Nazi, though some love the Nazi ideology and activity.
Instead I see the article where numbers are juggled for God knows what. 
Thus I say to you the article look unbalanced and with bad faith. I just do not have time to discuss details as it is from the start bad. The tags are unimportant until you will point to Hitler and Nazi in first sentence as the primary culprits. You or others definitely opposed the introductions, so…?
The “recent” is not for philosophical deliberations. I took the word and sentence from the same article written long before I knew about it. Just I emphasize existing points – maybe deliberately hidden somewhere in the back and under carpet. Again, somebody dos not like the truth? Put “most recent” if you like. Do you?
You must be referring to Overmans and Ingo Haar, two historians. Does the total number two really justify a plural expression? Anyway, let's take a look at them.
I agree that total number of German deaths in Poland could be 1.1 milions. Twice there, 6 years of ocupations and guerrilla warfare, escape front od Soviet Army in winter 1944 and last the expulssion, which I can be shure was fewest deadly. But be specific with this numbers do not stick others. I very much beleave that in the post war phase the were revanges, but again are you surprised ?– evry 5th person in Poland was killed. Are you expecting after the “total war” against civilians evry of Polish citizen will be ideal christian and give you other chick to hit. If that was expected so it means the Nazi sin is all the more bigger.

Finell, I agree with your points about full disclosure, before the election. It's all a bit of bother, but it can only raise the prestige of ArbCom.

 About biased articles 

I'm not sure if it's approariate to point out an AfD discussion to you, when you haven't previously been involved (is it?), but here seems to be another pretty bad case of WP:SYNTH: Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Communist_genocide. Taking a look at the sources used in the article, I have found absolutely nothing to confirm that """"communist genocide"""" is a real term or concept, not to mention a notable concept enough for its own article. We could rename it to """"Genocide commited by communist governments"""", but even then it seems too much like an advocating POV article and original synthesis. All the material is surely already present in the different genocide articles, so there doesn't seem to be any need for this kind of article. It seems pretty shocking if this kind of article is allowed to stay.   """,0

 Good Article Progress... 

There are several great Disney character articles on Wikipedia, but very few of them are classified GA. I am really trying to transform Belle into a good article, like Ariel from The Little Mermaid...how am I doing so far? Thoughts? Suggestions? I know the article is no where near nomination status...I would just like a few guidelines.

Just a thought but other minor films that she appeared in could be merged down in one section with a few mentions about the films without going into huge detail about them. Something like she's appeared in spin-off films regarding the character, something like that you know? Doesn't need a subsection for each movie it makes the article clunky. All of her appearances don't have to be put into such great detail; like the Kingdom Hearts info goes too far into the it, just a short summary would suffice. And I'm sure that you're aware that the article needs more info on the character's cultural impact, stuff like that. The information on the development seems, okay same amount in the Ariel article so there's that. I'd suggest getting rid of the list of Broadway Actresses it's kind of an eye sore, just a thought. Or put it to prose Yum. 

Another thing I noticed while I was editing the page, there are a lot of references to IMDB (the whole production cast and stuff like that, you used IMDB) when there are a lot of other options. The film usually has documentaries on production where you can get that info; that's where I got a lot of info when writing the Ariel article, and the commentaries are useful too. What I'm saying is that there's a tone of info on this character out there (the Blu-Ray has a tone of extras and documentaries that could be of use). And if you don't own the dvds or whatever I'd assume YouTube could be of service. And when you're citing your sources remember to put the original date that the information was published and all the access date stuff too. But it's going to take a while Yum. 

Believe it or not, I have actually been trying to use sources other than IMDb. The majority of my character development information came from other online sources. As for film and production documentaries, I am still new on learning how to source those, but I will look into it. And I always thought the """"date"""" section in the source template was meant for the date that you found the information. Thanks for letting me know!   

 Belle's eye color 

First off, there are no evidence that Belle's eyes are brown, just like there are no evidence that Aurora's eyes are blue. The movies, the Disney Princess website, the franchise and merchandise, and official artwork all depict Belle with hazel eyes and Aurora with violet eyes. And saying that there's only one person in the entire world who believes Belle's eyes are hazel is ridiculous. Search the internet, the people who believe her eyes are hazel are way more than the people who believe her eyes are brown.

People who claim her eyes are brown have no evidence to back that up. An article with an interview with the voice actress is not a good evidence, it's just a bunch of words. What evidence does the voice actress herself have to back up what she's saying?! It can't be any of the movies, they tell a different story.

A quote from the actress - """"She was also the first brown-eyed princess, the rest had blue eyes. She had a quirkiness and an oddness about her so many girls identified with Belle because they feel there is a part of her that is like them.""""

There are THREE lies buried in that first sentence; 1) Snow White was the first brown-eyed princess, not someone else. 2) Not all of the previous Princesses have blue eyes; Snow White has brown eyes and Aurora has violet eyes - that's half (2 out of 4) of the Princesses that do not have blue eyes. And 3) Belle's eyes are not brown as the movies themselves and other stuff will show you.

There's nothing wrong with articles as long as they don't condradict anything, but Paige O'Hara's words contradicted not one, but THREE things about the Disney Princesses.",0

Merge of Emerald Ash borer """"Infestation"""" with Emerald Ash borer
Kingofaces43, the formation of a separate page was necessary at this time because many of the subject facts covered in second page regarding Human actions induced by EAB does not fit the first. Eventually both might be merged into a streamlined example such as one completed about Dutch Elm disease. I think you would agree one of the most prevalent items making up today event is the unbelievable amount of misinformation continually supplied to the public Consciousness about this subject, including unproven theory from the best of tree Experts. So my goal is to utilize scientific peer review and field studies, along with other proven facts to correctly educate. Including successes and failures along with details about control through treatment also. Or are we supposed to produce a unique wiki page covering facts of how scientists properly apply insecticides. Yes even some facts seperatly belong within their specific wiki pages, like possible extinction of American Fraxinus placed on Fraxinus page. Or each page for 43 individual arthropods co-extinction caused by loss of ash. Separate """"Infestation"""" page would have been central location where temporally collected items regarding main subject could be kept. Lets work together, thanks.   
Hi . First off, please remember to put new sections on a talk page at the bottom (this is done automatically by using New section). That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:

I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from. 

With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.

no content
an infobox can be  contentthe one on Keenan Davis  just needs rewriting in sentences. Please check WP:CSD for the actual criteria for speedy deletion. '''''' ( talk ) 

Generally, a biography should have content about biographical information on the subject (not just player stats). Statistical information, such as date and place of birth, information on historical significance (N/A here), pictures, and information on accomplishments is usually accepted as the content of a biography on Wikipedia. What we have here are some of Keenan Davis' NFL stats. The page should be written from his childhood/early years up to how he got into the NFL and what he did to get there (such as being in minor leagues), like any normal biography.

I understand your point on how infoboxes can be content, but in this situation what we have is a biography with just NFL stats. How can we consider that a biography?

"SBharris, I have just looked at both of your links. In both cases, contrary to what you say above, the derivation requires that the term  only applies in the limit. In the former paper (arXive) it occurs at equation (13). In the latter paper (J price) this is clearly stated in the last sentence of the wording beside fig. 5 on page 14 of the pdf file.

This means that the  term must be exclusively a tangential term. Hence the other v term in the Coriolis force must be a radial term. In other words, these transformation equations only apply to co-rotating radial motion such as would occur if an object were to be constrained to move in a radial groove on a rotating turntable.

As regards circular motion, it appears that both you and Brews are unfamiliar with planetary orbital theory. A circular motion occurs when the inward gravity force (centripetal force) always exactly cancels with the outward centrifugal force.

You both insist that a circular motion involves a net inward centripetal force. If that were so, the radius would shrink and we wouldn't have a circular motion.

You are basing your beliefs in this regard upon the restricted high school derivation of centripetal force in circular motion. The force needed to rotate the velocity vector inwards shows up to be the standard expression for centripetal force. However, if we examine the exact same vector diagram for a straight line motion measured relative to the same origin, we will obtain the exact same expression, only radially outwards. The centripetal force in circular motion is therefore merely cancelling with the centrifugal force. This fact is totally overlooked in high school physics courses.

You must never lose track of the physical meaning behind the maths symbols which you use. These transformation equations cannot be applied to a particle which is stationary in the inertial frame. The entire derivation of those equations is based on the actual components of its actual acceleration. One component leads to the Coriolis force and the other component leads to the centrifugal force. If there is no actual acceleration, then these two components will both be either zero, or equal and opposite. There will be no net inward centripetal force no matter what frame of reference we view it from.

As regards the merry-go-round example, it actually undermines your point and bolsters the very point that I have been trying to make. The quote The radial Coriolis force associated with azimuthal motion is much like an increase or slackening of the centrifugal force tends to confirm my view that the so-called radial Coriolis force is in fact a centrifugal force and that in meteorology it would invoke Archimedes' principle and invoke a torque on a cyclone, due to differential centrifugal force on the east-west wind at one side, and the west-east wind at the other side.",0

 Please reconsider taking a break 

It's not just because of Sapphic's loss of temper that I'm suggesting a break, although it certainly plays a part.  I really think more progress would be made (in arriving at a community decision supported — and enforced — by ArbCom, as well as in getting the injunction lifted) if the named parties all removed themselves from the situation.

As for my comments about your son, I did NOT mean to imply that his trying out to be a SEAL was important to you and nobody else.  If I'd meant that, I'd have written it that way.  I don't like sarcasm or veiled insults, and prefer the more direct variety.  If I'm not writing mean things to you, then you can be sure I'm not thinking mean thoughts about you when I write whatever I do write.  I think in at least that one aspect of things, we have pretty similar views, and I definitely respect you for being able to shrug off insults.

I'm not posting anything to any of the dates-related pages for at least a week, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to convince Sapphic to do the same, and hopefully Locke Cole will follow suit.  You can choose to keep posting, but I don't think you're actually helping your cause by doing so at this point, and you may in fact be hurting it.

Hello, I see that you're a new Wikipedia editor.  Please click on this link:  Wikipedia:Verifiability and read the Wikipedia policy regarding verifiability.  It may sound strange, but Wikipedia requires that all information in articles (especially biography articles of living persons) be sourced to published, reliable sources that other people can reference to verify the information in the articles.  Saying that some information you add to an article is based on 'privileged' knowledge is really not allowed on Wikipedia, because what you are saying is that you know something that nobody else could know or verify.

 Intersection of Profession, Religion and Gender on Wikipedia 

Hi BHG, I'm posting this to you because I noticed you participated in an old series of CfD discussions and are familiar with it.

In the process of reviewing the situation involving the various articles on Islamic scholarship Islamic mathematics, Islamic science, Islamic metaphysics etc.  which have been subject to extensive edit-warring and outright deletion or stubbing in the case of some articles by two groups of editors broadly labeled Islamophiles and anti-Revisionists  a third group of people who might be termed Irrelevantists as they were unfamiliar with the subject and considered it non-notable due to religious content (which the anti-revisionist history buffs do not; they merely are vehemently against anything in the article that smacked of promotion) referred folks to the old discussions that led to the deletion of the """"Professionals by religion"""" Category, e.g. CfD:Astronomers by religion and CfD:Mathematicians by religion.

The vast consensus of those two discussions were that religion was utterly irrelevant to the personal or professional life of those professionals and even asked """"when would it end?"""" Much cracks were had about how religion was once relevant to scientists' lives but is now a historical curiosity. However the discussion boiled down to it being a non-intersecting and """"frankly absurd"""" means of categorizing people.

What I find interesting is that the same policies could be provided for Category:Women by occupation and yet no one has ever proposed deletion of that entire (huge) category tree, and in fact insisted on the exact opposite arguments, despite the fact that some women actively do object to being labeled as a """"Woman scientist"""", whereas no astronomer has ever objected to being labeled religious despite the disingenuous claim made in the above CfD. 

(Caveat: The only deletion ever proposed for the gender categories that I can see is that """"Women"""" is non-grammatical, which I disagree with  it sounds better than """"Female"""" and is commonly used even in cases where it is a neologism, such as """"women earth scientists"""" - grammatical but ridiculous)  the latter is a prime case of what I'm talking about. If it had been """"Muslim earth scientists"""" or another religion, it would have been deleted """"with extreme prejudice"""" and some vitriol by """"science vs. religion"""" types. But the rationale used would have been that it was non-intersecting and an article couldn't be written about it, which seems to be being selectively applied by Brightists on this site. (Some of these categories, an article could be written but that doesn't mean a category should exist, as one person on the """"Female"""" CfD noted. Especially since the women-in-science movement is very divided about whether women professionals should be categorized as such.) 

Full disclosure: a close family member is both a woman scientist and the past president of a graduate women in science professional organization, so no bias here.   """,0

I take some exception to what you're saying, Xander, though I agree with it in bulk. While there is artistic licence for an heraldic artist to interpret the blazon broadly, I am not at all familiar with any convention allowing for adding embellishments. Can you please provide a reference for same? I am completely unaware of any convention which allows an heraldic artist to add elements that are not described in the blazon. The arms are the blazon, period, and nothing more or less. Beyond My Ken, perhaps a better way to explain this to you... you think the representation of the arms is what matters, yes? That is not in fact the case. Blazons are much more like recipes; Mrs Fields has a single recipe for e.g. their chocolate chip cookie. That is the important thing. Anyone, possessing the recipe, could make a reasonable facsimile thereof. So there's that.
However, this is all fairly abstruse heraldic knowledge which not a lot of people know, which gives us the problem you are having; you feel that presenting a given cookie as a Mrs Fields cookie is inappropriate unless it was actually made by Mrs Fields. In one sense, you're right, but you're only right out of totally understandable ignorance of how heraldry works. 
All that being said, it is true that there are 'official' coats of arms inasmuch as they are the ones approved for use by the holder of the arms. For example, the representation of the Arms of Canada currently in use has been personally approved by The Queen and is thus 'official' for government use.  
And with all of that being said: the reference in question does not support the adornments added to the image. It supports only the blazon, and any depiction which follows only the blazon is both heraldically correct and properly sourced. →  ₪

 Official Notice 

I am posting this here, per WP:ADMINABUSE, as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question. I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me. However, as a matter of principle, I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right, even though it would be much easier to just drop this, and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success. I realize that to err is human. I'm not looking for your head on a platter. I'm not even looking for an apology. I too, am human, and far from perfect. In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I """"should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus"""" on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations """"should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion."""" My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me. I thank you for your time, and await your response.   """,0

Never trust spell-checkers, it's better to guess, and your's was better than that of the Japanese gentleman who, prey to a phonological difficulty in pronouncing 'l', wrote 'interrectual', which is, judging by the historical record, an occupational hazard of that class. It's a medicinal necessity for me to pick on people, as it stops me from picking my nose, which can lead to major haemorrhaging (sp.?)at my age, and I dislike the idea of an obituary writing that down as the cause of my death.  

sorry nishidani I removed your bit on league of nation mandate as it is already mentioned further up the article..  
No need to apologize. We all make errors, and I more than most. I can never get any work done, trying to reason on talk pages. I see now Shiruberstein, an editor I like, is taking me to task for never having writing any article of quality, but only edit-warred (? a strange interpretation of a 3 year attempt to reason through fundamental problems to get some lineaments of consensus) so I guess I must rethink everything here. It really is a waste of time. Cheers

Don't use the word 'Israelophiles' within my hearing. There are a lot of people who love that country, within and beyond, and yet are as deeply distressed by its military and political history as they are of their own. (Many virulent critics of America are infused with a deep patriotism, idem elsewhere). Always distinguish, cultivate an ear for nuance, particularly in what you say or think, otherwise you needlessly offend decent people. (Asto the rest, of course)  

I'm sorry if the word offends...I don't know of any other word that can be used to describe someone who is in love with Israel...Its use is the same as Anglophile or francophile...I have come to the conclusion that nationalism is a destructive force with very few redeeming qualities....  
You're right in logical terms, since it has analogies with the terms with which you compared it. But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country ('Anglo'/'Franco'/'Sino'/'Russo'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts. There's an informal rule that ethnic disyllable are neutral, a pejorative connotations elicit monosyllables ('spik, wog, yid, chink, gook, hun','nip'/'jap', 'frog' etc., though exceptions exist, 'Polack') and this plays round the other terms, to nuance them in various ways. Language is a minefield, and what to one ear sounds okay, to others may resonate differently.
To illustrate on a different level, Wiki as I said is full of incoherencies over pages, and hidden traps, and most efforts, as the present one on 'Judea and Samaria' to get clarity and conceptual coherence into the encyclopedia fail because most people are tone-deaf to these things. One I noted long ago was that in articles like that on Avraham Stern,Lehi, orGush Enumin you'll often note native Israeli editors insisting on the word 'underground' to describe them, these ultra-Zionist terrorist movements, and, I don't think this word is used of comparable Arab movements i",0

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistru",0

""""African descent""""?
If a model's race must be stipulated (although I don't see why it should be, since black plus-size models do very well in the industry, and are not particularly seen less often than Caucasian plus-size models), wouldn't it be better to say that a model is """"black"""" rather than """"of African descent""""? A good faith suggestion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.215.23.237   

 It is relevant to denote her race in terms of the cosmetics work with Cover Girl; I strongly disagree that black models are 'not particularly seen less often than caucasian models' in this style of model work or any other, especially in an international context.  Although they may do 'as well' relatively, the amount of work is markedly less than that for caucasian models outside of the U.S.  Tesfay was born in Canada of Eritrean descent so the common descriptor """"African American"""" is erroneous.  To make it simple, 'black' it is.   

Link Spam
Not sure where to look on Wiki for the answer to this, so I'll ask here: when does a web link become web spam?  When the link breaks, or merely when someone notices that links have been added to an article?  For an article needing to find more sources, recent removals of all weblinks seems a bit overzealous to me.   

CALENDARS
The whole calendar paragraph is problematic now, I think; too big for the article relative to its significance. It's not possible to rank these along with ANTM, print magazines, etc., any more than online magazines, because they don't have anything like the same kind of public reach, and the naming of specific calendars in the first place invites spam. Since 2007, the year of the named calendars, is (nearly) over, and they haven't become annual publications, I think the paragraph should be cut back to refer to the launch of several calendars in general, without naming specifics, otherwise there's the impossible requirement of defining exactly what is or is not a notable calendar.  Also, the sentence about fostering a healthier industry attitude is too generic and applies to many projects involving plus-size models, not just these calendars. You'd need to repeat the same sentence in nearly every item in the article if it appears here. I recommend something like, """"2007 was the launch year for several grassroots calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, spurring similar projects in the following year.""""
Perhaps to be named, a calendar would have to merit its own Wiki entry, and undergo an AfD discussion.   
 I do not understand why you are trying to compare TV shows with consumer products and it is disingenuous of you to want to.  MODE no longer exists, should that be expunged from the article too?  I agree to a certain point about modifying the mention of calendars, however there are good media references available for the Fenomenal Calendar and this article sorely needs every good source link it can get.  The originators of a market niche are worth noting IMO; the rest are just jumping on the bandwagon (in terms of seeking self-promotion, not in production quality or financial returns) and certainly none of them yet are at the aesthetic level of Fenomenal, no matter what opinion one may hold on the theme of the styling, size of the models, or comparisons between unrelated other print products, such as MODE Magazine for example.  Further, I do not believe it necessary for a single mention to undergo AfD or else every model named to their own paragraph on this article should do the same.  I would think that a Fenomenal weblink is appropriate because the homepage remains visible online.  This calendar does set the standard for commercially-available calendar products; in the absence of Elena Miro's calendar remaining online for people to see, which in any case was never available for purchase and should only be considered a promotional item - anything other in comparison is apples and turnips.

 Suggestion: """"2007 was the launch year for several [link=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homegrown homegrown] calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, including the well-received (media reflink) Fenomenal Calendar (weblink).  These calendars have opened up a new market for the models to be seen outside of clothing advertising-only contexts, and also enabled them to capture the interest of people outside of the usual plus-size clothing consumer demographic.NEWL",0

"""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  

I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.

But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

Nits and Appreciation from Robert Steele

1)  Second ranking civilian:  at the time there were about 25 civilians in Marine Corps intelligence.  The top person was John Guenther, an SES-6 who had been there forever.  I was the second, as a GM-14.  All others were GS-09 to GS-13.  It is an accurate fact.

2)  On the Drug War film, I did not volunteer.  The film producer got in touch with me because of my Amazon reviews, eg. LOST HISTORY on contras, drugs, and CIA, and asked if I could come to Los Angeles for filming.  I agreed provided he would pay my expenses, which he did, and I volunteered my time.

3)  The COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE book is my first book to be published that does not have my name on the cover.  I am turning now toward nurturing and aggregating others and although I have three chapters in this book, recommend it be listed.

If anyone wants to engage in dialog leading to improvements of this page (for example, my three most recent seminal articles on OSINT are at www.oss.net/OSINT-S, www.oss.net/OSINT-O, and at www.oss.net/HILL where my article on """"The Open Source Program: Missing in Action"""" is being read by virtually everyone either planning to attend or deciding not to attend the DNI OSINT conference

""":I won't reiterate what the professor has stated above, but there is a """"Middle-Earth"""" franchise, or at the very least there is a """"Lord of the Rings"""" franchise"""" to which all Lord of the Rings adaptations belong. You cannot just go out and make a Lord of the Rings film without the required licensing, since all LOTR films are made from the same intellectual property. The Peter Jackson series is not a franchise, it is one instance of an independently produced series in a franchise that includes multiple adaptations across multiple media. Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information. As for the information being out of date, there is usually a short lag between Sunday-Monday as the data is released and then update in the chart.

Proposed addition of two See Also and two references

If there is no objection, I propose to add two See Also:

Community Open Source Program Office, Open Source Investment Strategy (late 1990's)
Report to the Director of Central Intelligence, the Challenge of Global Coverage (July 1997)

The first was written by Joe Markowitz, the second by Boyd Sutton.  Both are stored at www.oss.net with
persistent URLs, so hopefully we are over the """"self-promotion"""" bit.

If there is no objection, I propose to add three links in references, all to actual documents:

General Al Gray, Commandant of the Marine Corps, """"Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's,"""" American Intelligence Journal (Winter 1988-1989).  This was the first-ever public call for changing the focus on intelligence from the Soviet Union to revolution, crime, and terrorism; and also the first-ever public call by a Service or Agency head to shift emphasis from secret to open sources.  
Joint Military Intelligence Training Center, Open Source Intelligence Handbook (June 1996)
Special Operations Forces Open Source Intelligence Handbook (Strawman)

All of these are visible with links via www.oss.net/BASIC.  If BASIC can be locked in and protected, perhaps there is no need for the added references, but I suspect my work, which has now survived three days, will be vandalized eventually, so I defer to the group on what is best.

Also, talk pages should generally not be archived if they are less than 75K in size.  Please go back through your list and change all of them to use  instead of . I'll also note that setting up archiving on talk pages like this usually only occurs once a discussion is started on the talk page to see if there is any objection, if there is consensus or no comments, or if the page is above the 250K threshold.

While it is acceptable to use only OneClickArchiver on a user's talk page if that is what they wish and the size of their page doesn't get out of hand, bots should archive all other talk pages.

Objectivity
I read a few things about this guy. I do not care for his political ideals. I'm just wondering, should a guy with political affiliations write articles?
How will he be objective? Why not just get another guy to write the articles?

Is Wikipedia only going to allow people with the """"right"""" politics (i.e. liberal) to write articles?

That's not true at all!  There's a lot of diversity of accepted views here.  Wikipedia is a place where there's great harmony and cooperation among neo-cons, Isreali-Likkudists, and conspiracy-bashing pseudo-leftists like Chip Berlet -)

 Neutrality? 

""""There are also allegations that the attention and sympathy especially from the Australian public and media may be related to xenophobic sentiment and a unfair mistrust of Asian legal systems. Also, many think there was no motive for Corby to transport marijuana from Brisbane to Bali where the value is far less, and where it is readily available on the street not far from her prison (and even within it), i.e. it would be like smuggling ice to Eskimos.""""

This seems POV to me.  (Of course, in the interests of full disclosure I believe that she is guilty).

I added some referencing to a Sydney Morning Herald article where it was alleged that Australian marijuana (in particular hydroponically grown marijuana) sold quite well in Bali for a few reasons:
 Indonesian marijuana is quite poor in quality - rich tourists generally prefer the Australian stuff.
 Due to the lack of entrapment laws in Indonesia, tourists can often be caught by Balinese police stings - and so prefer to buy their marijuana off other whites, who are less likely to be members of the Indonesian police.

I can understand the text on the (turns out to be non-lethal) white powder being sent to the embassy being removed.  I believe that even though a link hasn't been established between the two events that this incident will have a bearing on the case, and especially its portrayal (spelling?) in Indonesia, but I can see why the lack of a clear connection between the two events has led to its removal.

That said, I cannot understand why the text on """"smuggling ice to Eskimos"""" is allowed to remain whereas the text from the Sydney Morning Herald, a respected (within Australia at least) news source is not.  If the view that there would be no point smuggling marijuana to Indonesia is allowed to remain, why not the view that there would be a point, especially if that view is put forward by a major Australian newspaper?  The article seems POV and biased in favour of Corby to me.

 Position 

It's always been my opinion that the infobox was supposed to offer an overview of a baseball playe's career; detail is left for the article. Babe Ruth's infobox lists him as a """"Right fileder / Left fielder / Pitcher."""" I find that silly. In my opinion it should say, """"Pitcher / Outfielder."""" Number one, it's more correct cronologically, and number two, do we really need to split up the outfield positions on an infobox? I could understand putting """"Left fielder"""" for someone like Barry Bonds or Ted Williams or someone else who spent his entire career at one outfield position, but when he's played more than one outfield position, splitting it up like that is a little bit too much information and just makes the infobox look cumbersome.

"I deeply apologize for overlooking your last two messages of Jan 3 until today.  I'm still new at this and I simply didn't see them, although I certainly should have.

Anyway, your pictures of the Richards building are great!  Some of them, such as the full-height shots of the western service tower and the two towers flanking the main entrance, aren't available anywhere else as far as I know. The porch photos certainly help to illustrate the Vierendeel trusses that support each floor.  This collection of photos will benefit anyone who is studying what is generally considered to be Kahn's breakthrough work.  If you don't mind, I might make minor changes to some of the descriptions.  In particular, you correctly identified the two types of shafts in the photo taken from the garden on the south side, so I would remove the question marks from that description.

If you ever get a chance to visit the Olivetti-Underwood Factory building near Harrisburg, that would be great, especially since that article doesn't have any photos at all.  I suspect, however, that the building will be difficult to photograph.  The standard books on Kahn's work usually include a shot of one of its 72 mushroom-shaped (more-or-less) structural units while it was under construction, one of the entire building taken at an angle from an airplane, and one of the old entrance that was apparently at the northeast corner.  The old entrance seems to have been closed, so from the ground on the outside, options today seem to be limited.  

It still might be possible, however, to take a photo that gives viewers a feel for the size and shape of one of those 72 mushroom units, which would be very helpful.  When I follow the link in that article to the aerial photo of the building, I see that those units might be most visible and accessible from the west side, so perhaps a meaningful photo could be taken of the mushroom unit in the northwest corner of the building.  You would want to emphasize the west side of that mushroom unit, which has an indentation separating it from the next unit to the south, which should help to visualize its shape.  The north side of that mushroom has a triangular protrusion between it and the next mushroom to the east, which I suspect would obscure its shape.  Frankly, I'm not sure how well this will work from the ground, but it is worth a try.  Depending on the light, it might work better to try a similar photo of the mushroom unit on the northeast side of the building, where I think the old entrance used to be, again de-emphasizing the protruding triangle on the east side if possible.

Also, perhaps there is a visitor's area in the entrance lobby where photos of the internal structure of that mushroom unit are permitted?

Good luck, and thanks again.",0

"""Colonialism==
The section on Colonialism is very inadequate.  No sources are cited. I recommend that the following be added:

To speak of the """"scramble for Africa"""" is to begin a debate centuries old. In the words of Robert Collins, """"The explanations [for the colonization of Africa] are nearly as unsatisfactory as they are numerous.  The misconceptions are as enduring as they are erroneous.  To scholar and student alike, the search for understanding this dynamic period, which resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and dramatically altered the future of a vast continent, is the Problem of the Partition of Africa.""""Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7

By 1870, many European nations were interested in the African interior, and began moving up the rivers.  Generally, except for a few cases, foreign powers could not move beyond """"small coastal enclaves."""" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301  But from the years of 1880-1900, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: Liberia, an independent state partly settled by African Americans; and Orthodox Christian Ethiopia (known to Europeans as """"Abyssinia""""). Colonial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.

The scramble came from the rising of a new world from old Europe.  Until this point, Britain had been the undisputed leader in the industrial realm.  They could produce more manufactured goods than any other country, and at the lowest price.  Britain promoted the idea of """"free trade"""" in Africa, the idea that no European countries would interfere with one another while freely trading in Africa.  Britain had no worries until the 1860's when """"France, Germany, and the United States had caught up with Britain in terms of industrial technology and manufacturing."""" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301 

As a result of this industrialization of the world, there was a shortage of markets to sell to.  many European countries, as a result, looked to Africa as a potential client. Some believed when diamonds were discovered in 1869 they """"provided the incentive and capital for a large influx of Europeans.""""Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7  The creation of the Suez Canal """"not only made the East African coast more accessible but also became the great pivot in British imperial strategy.""""ibid., 7 Above all else, we must look at this imperial world pragmatically and not ideologically. Until this point, """"military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe.  Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage."""" John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800, second edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 7

But a new world, as noted above, had begun.  Because of new competition in the trading industries of Europe and the Americas, Britain now had rivals for trade in Africa.  Even smaller countries sometimes wanted to get involved looking for quick cash and to find ways to sustain their countries.  Within the hubris of the European nations was the ideal of """"national prestige,"""" an idea that holding African colonies would increase the power of a nation.Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 303 New technology as well in the form of the """"repeater rifle"""" and the """"maxim-gun"""" gave Europeans new advantages over Africa. There had been trade of guns with Africa before this era, but as Hilaire Belloc put it:

Whatever happens we have got

The Maxim gun; and they have not.Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301     

But the main question that we must decide is how the partition of Africa began. What was the primary catalyst for """"the scramble?""""

"""Revisiting neutrality on the Clinton entry==
I edited some content about the Richard Mellon Scape adversarial relationship with Clinton that dogged his career for 8 years and even after he left office. Many of the controversies raised during Clinton's term were a DIRECT result of the Scape Arkansas Project and to see any reference to Richard Mellon Scape's part in Clinton's troubles just """"disappear"""" seems like a very """"right-wing-view"""" sanitization of the Wikipedia. 
As the, arguably, most important adversary of Clinton for a lengthy portion of Clinton's political career, to obliterate any mention of this relationship comes close to censorship.
R.M. Scape is one of two very large and looming forces at work in American politics in the early 21st century, the other being George Soros on the left. Their fingerprints, from behind the curtain, certainly draw analogies to the Wizard(s) of Oz.
Please note that I did not vote for Clinton either time, being somewhat more conservative, but I have noticed an apparent right shifted bias developing in areas that touch upon politically related items in the Wikipedia lately - and """"it ain't good"""" as they say. 

This slow erosion of complete disclosure concerning what is stylized as """"right wing leaning"""" viewpoints and the retention of those things which critisize """"left wing leaning"""" viewpoints is subtle but steady - not just here, but across many places on the Wikipedia. While they make me smile sometimes, my inclination toward keeping Wikipedia neutral reins in my mirth.

I would encourage the group to rethink the neutrality of Wikipedia & work very hard to balance the influences on both sides to prevent any more of this """"shading"""" of the Wikipedia.

I know it is very hard to remain absolutely objective but it is imperative that we do so in order to remain a respected source. To remain COMPLETELY factual without opinionated bias, it seems to me Wikipedia should error on the side of INclusion rather than EXclusion.

 novaseminary pov pushing,and section blanking.  So everyone is aware of his pov editing, I have copied some of his history here.  I ask other editors not to restore his versions as they are pov and section blanking.
Here is a little histoy on novaseminry. More can easily be found. I include it here to show the type of editor he is.
 
Request topic ban of User:Novaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait (stuntman)
 
User:Novaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP deleted twice before. Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP's notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP's subject over several editor's objections.
 
But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
 This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 
Unfortunately, it's more than a content issue. It's a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior. So per WP:DDE, ANI """"may be the best first step."""" 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone. Drmies (talk) 
Fact is, unless admins enforce it, don't count on it. Otherwise I wouldn't have had to come here. I've suggested several times that Novaseminary just take a Wikibreak from the article. He refused. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 

 
I found this at WP:RFPP and have spent more time than I'm willing to admit looking through it all. 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive, but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminary's bizarre obsession with this person. I'm going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel 
 You know what? I'll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I'll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV. Thanks. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 
I've never violated a single guideline or policy at this article. The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i've come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i've done i've discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) 
I would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk) 
Our IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same. From your comments above that the IP's edits are the only reason you've even been editing the page recently, this should be an acceptable resolution for you too. Right? – Steel  Yes. Novaseminary?

Rankings
At the beginning of October, substantial material was added which is mostly critical of the University's recent performance and advertising. With a few tweaks, this material has mostly been accepted on Wikipedia. However, the section on rankings has since then been subject to a slow edit war between the original anon and another. I reproduce the fuller version of the section below for discussion:
In 2010 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand. Its individual global subject rankings were: 212th in Arts & Humanities, 110th in Engineering & IT, 242nd in Natural Sciences, and 152nd in Social Sciences. In 2011 the University of Canterbury slipped from 189th to 212th in these rankings.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5569146/NZ-universities-lose-ground University loses ground. As the 2011 results were released, the University of Canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the VIce Chancellor Dr Rod Carr claims that it ranks among the top 2% of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was assessed.http://www.bsec.canterbury.ac.nz/ Uni in top 2%. Further, the University has promoted itself as being the first university in New Zealand to have been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5708043/Canterbury-University-gets-top-marks Canterbury University gets top marks. Unlike the QS World University rankings, QS Stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee; the programme is designed to give """"...those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students, to stand out and to be recognised for their excellence.http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/qs-stars/ QS Stars.""""
The second anon wishes to truncate the paragraph after the second sentence, ie from """"In 2011"""" onwards. No reason has been given for this. I have suggested that this third sentence remain, since it is purely factual and referenced, but I am less willing to defend the rest of the paragraph which appears to be combining a number of sources to make an argument or inference not directly supported by the sources directly. My proposal is clearly not satisfactory to either of the anons. I welcome their explanations here, and input from other parties.-gadfium """,0

"Addition of history 

As can be seen, I have added a new history section for the Bank of Liverpool - previously there were just a few lines of intro. I have taken it up to 1918, when the Bank acquired Martins Bank and became the Bank of Liverpool and Martins. There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.

I propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928, when the name was shortened to Martins, and possibly beyond.

How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article. One solution would be to have Martins pre-1918 history as a self-contained article with the Bank of Liverpool article continuing up to 1969.",0

I would really like to begin such an article! I believe it can be created and it could be a great article. There are many people who don´t practice a religion, yet have opinions about the morality of homosexual acts, for instance. In my high school, whenever we had a debate about homosexuality and someone was against or in favor of the acceptance of homosexuality, the arguments used were never religious, and yet a discussion about the morality of homosexuality would happen. Maybe those commmon arguments could be in this article. Like the common view that it is not natural to be gay and therefore it is wrong. And the common answer to this which states that we all do things which are not """"natural"""" every day, like driving a car and using condoms. Or the other answer which would see it as being natural. The same-sex marriage article has some of those moral views independent of a religion.  """,0

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

"""I disagree with you. Maudoodi was a big cause of the 1953 violent Anti-Ahmadiyya riots and this certainly makes him militant if not outright terrorist.

@ you will do just fine; and Shabaz was """"made"""" to retire as far as my personal opinion is concerned(his is by far the dirtiest dysysop I have witnessed ever). However Dougweller is quite an expert so his input will be valuable. Now to matter at hand. The current version of the article has three basic problems which I will list below. We can discuss them together or separately as you wish. (Code 16 apparently agrees with my other edits, even though he does not wish to state it, I would also like to state that  is quite right, I misunderstood prophetic as being concerned with prophecy at first but I am certain now that it means pertaining to the prophet)
 It has been proven here that Israr Khan is just a non notable run of the mill professor at some Malaysian university who writes self published books. Consensus has already been reached between me and Code16 that he is an unreliable source for content, as is clear from the discussion I linked. So I would like to contest his views being added here, or anywhere else for that matter. 
 Hallaq has been given a new section all by himself without any rationale. He is a western scholar so he should be included with other western scholars and given due weight. To be frank his weight should be LESS than other western scholars, as he is not a scholar of hadith per se. He is a scholar of law/jurisprudence, and as law is based on hadith he is also knowledgeable in hadith. But he cannot compare with other scholars whose main interest was hadith.  
 I would like to contest the creation of """"authenticity"""" subsection. My  argument is that this section is highly misleading. It leads one to assume that other scholars are against hadith for other reason, whereas in reality almost all scholars(both western and eastern) criticize hadith because they consider it as """"inauthentic"""". So this section should not be created at all. Regards   """,0

Other Asian References  This Matsuda tour also went to Indonesia and I can find almost indecipherable references on what looks like Indonesian google and wikipedia. But while researching the topic, I discovered why his appearance in the 1990 Disney movie Newsies was so notable.  He is chinese and his appearance in the movie became a milestone in that he was an Asian playing in a non-stereotyped role. As an early role model for Asian actors, I can see that there ia a hollywood social group called """"Team Yellow"""" and they seem to all be friends and have dinners once a year. But beyond discussion on social sites, I fear I cannot find news material on this topic. A further Asian reference, that also involves his modelling career, is that he is the model used in Photographer David LaChappelle's current exposition on Chinese Pop Culture and Bruce Lee which opened in Hong Kong just last month. There is a video on his site of David LaCapelle making these works, and the David LaChapelle site on the Hong Kong Show has the pieces available for online viewing. However, I don't think links to the video and a viewing of the show pieces is enough and would have to find news articles about the show in Hong Kong journals.

P.S.:You said in your comment """"we are just a little bit richer"""", it can´t apply to Serbia, because it´s way much poorer than in the 80´s. Yugoslav Serbia was way better. There was freedom to travel (to Yugoslav citizens wasn´t even required visas for majority of western countries) and had, limited throu, private property or companies. We had the EURO in 1976, Olympic winter games in 1984, the non-alignement was a very interesting initiative... Younger people (even in Serbia too) doesn´t know much of that. Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic, going skiing was usual, travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps, to Italy or Spain in summer, was """"normal"""" to many Belgraders. I see you been to South Serbia (Niš and Leskovac), but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer (double, or even more). About the separatism, it was a huge error (for Serbia) not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period. All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia (call me nationalist, but that is a fact). Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldn´t be a """"big"""" orthodox Kingdom of Serbia. Neither Vatican, Austria, Germany or Turkey, neither France and UK (with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia) wanted that, so a """"neutral"""" Yugoslavia was imposed. About the Serbian-Bulgarian problem, it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see, so it had to be compensated with lands, part of current Macedonia, that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria. I know and recognise that. You have the maps on the page (Kingdom of Serbia) where you see that the Serbo-Bulgarian border was moved east, so that Albaian state was created. All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia. We could talk centuries about it, wright?   """,0

Wikipedia Regrets The Errors

[Suggested Text]:

From June to September of 2007, several false and misleading critical statements appeared at the National Civilian Community Corps (also known as AmeriCorps NCCC) page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civilian_Community_Corps), in violation of Wikipedia standards.  This is the false text as it appeared:

National Civilian Community Corps

""""...Criticisms
The NCCC program has met with sharp criticisms from some fiscal conservatives who accused it of being a """"boondoggle"""".[4] Most notably, Libertarian pundit and commentator James Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud""""[5], in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain: The Explosion and Abuse of Government Power in the Clinton-Gore Years."""" Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it """"a fraud"""".
^ http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188385,00.html ^ http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm""""

Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information.

The following has been called to our attention:

1.  The statement that read """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud,"""" cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard: http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement.  No mention of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor of the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" appears in that article, nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a 'waste and fraud.""""  We regret the error.

2. The same sentence went on to state the following:  """"...Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents, calling it a """"waste and fraud"""", in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book """"Feeling Your Pain ...""""

Upon investigation, this statement turns out to be untrue.  Bovard's book (published in hardcover by St. Martin's press) does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book """"Feeling Your Pain.  In fact, neither """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" nor the """"National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index.  (The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program, AmeriCorps, but does not mention the program known as """"AmeriCorps NCCC'"""" or the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""".

(The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes, referring to a speech by then-president Clinton, praising, not criticizing, the NCCC.)

In sum, the book """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not dedicate """"an entire chapter of criticisms"""" of AmeriCorps NCCC, contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website.  We regret the error.

3.  Also untrue was the sentence """"Robert Sweet, the former director of the National Institute of Education, labeled it [i.e., AmeriCorps NCCC] """"a fraud"""".  This sentence was misleading and false.  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence, the AmeriCorps NCCC.

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1000americorps.htm.  No mention of either the """"National Civilian Community Corps"""" nor of """"AmeriCorps NCCC"""" appears in that article.  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr. Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a """"fraud.""""  We regret the error.

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did.

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued re-emergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry.

Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page, to be a team player, etc., would be better received by this editor if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site  - not to mention, it might restore some of Wikipedia's credibility on this subject.   Given the nature of the NCCC - a substantial and serious component of U.S. disaster relief and mitigation capacity - and its recent near-demise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia, the statement above is not written as amusement.

"Hi, Osorin. I deleted the article, because it didn't assert why the web service is notable. There is a bunch of things I can link you to where you can read more, for example mainly WP:A7 an WP:WEB, but also pay attention to WP:N, and if you are somehow related to the company that supplies the service, WP:COI. The best way to demonstrate notability, is by showing there exist independent reliable sources, that provide significant coverage on the subject. Every part of that phrase matters, so the sources have to be independent of the subject, they have to be reliable sources according to Wikipedia standards (the main part of that is: there has to be editorial review of the sources, see WP:RS), and they have to be about Teamness itself, not just mention it.

I find it amazing how you can write so much, and yet, say so little. That massive essay above is just the same stuff you've been saying for ages and everyone here has already rejected it (Apart from about the document Kolzene presented, I agree that that can certainly be used for the article). Again you're going on about this Urbanates thing, you said we should replace the Urbanates section with some undefined notion of """"Urban Planning"""", but you don't seem to get the fact that Urban Planning and Urbanates are exactly the same thing in Technocracy. A Technate wouldn't go on building old style cites, it would be build Urbanates, therefore any Urban Planning will be the planning of Urbanates. You say """"I would suggest Hibernian that you or someone make a file of the Wilton Ivey piece, and use that in reference to Urban Planning."""", but that is essentially what is already there, the Urbanates article was mostly written in reference to the ideas Wilton Ivey, etc. If you want a longer section about what a Technate might do with cities before it replaces them with Urbanates (which would likely take decades to build), then be my guest if you know some specifics about it. However, so far you have added absolutely nothing to that section, you have only deleted material from it, so I'm not very optimistic about what you could contribute (especially taking into account your incredibly biased opinions on the issue). And I will confirm again, your edits will be reverted without mercy when the protection is ended, so there is no point trying to convince anyone here to keep them.  """,0

 Outback gothic 

With this edit, an editor recently reinstated some text about Australian horror films.

Second, the theme of outback gothic has been dissembled for no reason because it listed a couple of less famous films.""""

"""I believe a number of statements from this supplement to WP:OR are relevant to this discussion:
Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.
Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only """"cervical cap"""").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.
Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so """"cervical cap"""" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.

I am not attached to the title of """"cervical cap"""" for this article.  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Lea's Shield into this article, but, like David and Una, I am open to looking for a new name.  Anon, are you willing to consider a merge with a name change?  If so, we can discuss alternatives to """"cervical barrier"""", which you have objected to. Talk     C

Quran qoute should be deleted
In the section Position on use of armed strength to achieve aims
This Quran qoute should be deleted:

The Qur'an states, """"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not do aggression, for Allah loves not the aggressors. Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers."""" (Al-Baqarah 190-193)[85]

The qoute is from a non Hezbollah-affiliated website and thus it is irrelevant to Hezbollah's stance on the use of armed strength. Hezbollah may also use this surah to legitimize the use of armed strength, but one would have to cite directly to a Hezbollah source to prove so. You can probably find some usuable qoutes in Naem Qassem's book Hizbullah: The story from within published in 2006 or from Hezbollah website.

"Now even the discussion attempts to further contextualize and diminish the Red Army's crimes!  The Red Army's crimes remain crimes - there is always a context and a reason for any crime committed by anyone.  What Wehrmacht or SS soldiers did or did not do in no way justifies or sufficiently contextualizes-away rapes committed against women aged 8 (and lower) to 80+. Unfortunately that is what this article in its present form attempts to do. On top of that, this article about rape gives no voice to the raped and only offers voices of the perpetrators that dismiss the accusations.  It's rather perverse, misogynistic, and revisionist.  A more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic would be to give a straight-forward account of the wide-spread rapes/violence by the Red Army, including accounts from various Nazi|women/victims.  After that, background/context should be given to help understand why this happened, but never in a way that implies that crimes do not remain crimes.  In addition, a section on Soviet/Russian ways of interpreting/handling on the violence/rapes would be informative as well.  In its current form, this article does Wikipedia a disservice and is yet another example of a biased and amateurish account of history that cements Wikipedia's reputation as an unreliable source of information.  It is only by tackling these types of issues effectively that the Wikipedia community can prove it can be a viable source of information.  

Re:  profoundly a-historical suggestion.

Contextualizing the supposed crimes, as claimed by Udibi, is not the same thing as diminishing those acts of punishment inflicted on the Nazis for murdering 20,000,000 people.  I find his reference to SS Paramilitary as soldiers to be deeply disturbing, a-historical, ill-informed, and suspicious, as SS Paramilitaries were not soldiers and were not even part of the military.  While Nazi acts of genocide do not in themselves justify rape, they make it very understandable why people who assisted in the worst mass murder in history were punished by the surviving victims.  Related, the Nazis were very popular and had massive support from the population, who in turn offered no resistance to the Nazi regime; he who keeps silent consents; these women were therefore active supporters of the Holocaust.  It would not have been difficult for them to fight against the Nazis in some way, and they should not receive sympathy for not doing so and allowing 20,000,000 people to be murdered.  I really see no problem of revisionism here.  I recommend that other editors be very wary of this proposal to create a self proclaimed more appropriate, balanced, and meaningful way to tackle this topic as it may lead us to perpetuating the moral equivalency arguments of covert Holocaust deniers.

I think we also need to consider whether this is not just a case of hundreds of thousands of German women getting lucky with their liberators (a view shared by many Germans, described in The Fall of Berlin 1945) and then telling local Nazi leaders or Werewolf members that they were raped, in a regime where they could not openly have any sort of relationship with Russians.

Content issues

There are emerging guidelines within the Indigenous peoples WikiProject that I have begun to apply across the board for BC First Nations.  The main one is that there are different types of articles, even when their content and location/people may seem to overlap (I'll sign each section/paragraph so comments on specific points can be made easily: 
""""Ethno & Culture"""" articles
Not as loose as it sounds, despite having to describe it like this: """"ethno/history/culture/peoples""""
which this article, as titled, would fit into.  These articles get Category:First Nations in British Columbia, with """"First Nation"""" here meant in an ethnic sense, not in a governmental-org one.  Ideally these will always be simply named, without """"Nation"""" appended, as with Secwepemc and Nuu-chah-nulth - or Stó:lō  (variable forms like Nuu-chah-nulth-aht can be redirects, although that term can include the Pacheedaht which normally wouldn't want to be called Nuu-chah-nulth). 
Government articles
bands/First Nations, tribal councils, treaty groups) which have government-related content, ranging from chiefs and councillors, affiliations, treaty issues, modern demographics, economic and social issues, and so on  These articles get Category:First Nations governments in British Columbia.  In the case of the Stó:lō the main government article is going to be (created in a few minutes...): Stó:lō Nation, and will list all its subgovernments; """"Indian Band"""" and """"First Nation"""", sometimes just """"Nation"""" are all interchangeable, although some bands seem to have a preference (at different times, given by variable content on various website sources); whatever is picked.  Non-Indian Act-based governments can be and should described under different titles, either in the ethno type or in the history type (see below) 
language articles
'nuff said, but can be titled either in native language (St'at'imcets) or in the form Shuswap language; Wiki guidelines, it should be stressed, prefer the latter (use English, which is the language of the encyclopedia...).  Some ethno and gov articles will have more than one language listed in their cats; some languages span more than one gov group, or in the case of the Sto:lo and Chehalis, two different ones.  Cats for this are specialized in the linguistics hierarchy (examples later), but they should generally all take the relevant nation-category if there is one Category:Secwepemc, Category:Stó:lō, Category:Syilx etc. 
Community/Reserve articles
Communities, reserves/IRs, towns that have significant native presence also; there is a difference, note, between the physical object of a reserve, and the band government that runs it; the descrption of the reserve is here, that of the government; even though this will not just overlap with the government articles but also the ethno/peoples ones; just interlink everything and it will sort of make sense; it's just a question of what was being searched for; the Scw'exmx and Spaxomin bands are all listed under Nicola Tribal Association, for instance; but the latter article is about the association, not about the communities; similarly, Shackan and Nooaitch are communities as well as reserves, but articles about them should focus on the community's particular history, not on overall Scw'exmx culture.  In the case of the Sto:lo, there is another issue of """"where to fit the Chehalis"""" as they are in the same cultural/language area, but they are not Sto:lo by organization or by their own appellation.  Or the Tsleil-wau-tuth who are culturally Skxwxu7mesh but are part of the Sto:lo Nation (or were, last time I looked); so there's some confusing bits here and there.
""""Mythology"""" articles
User:OldManRivers has pointed out the """"mythology"""" articles and the cats that go with them; awkward wording/titling but in the absence of anything more workable, that's all there is for now.
History/Biography articles
there is another sort-of category for specific history articles, e.g. Chilcotin War, Fraser Canyon War and various bio articles (Simon Gunanoot, Slumach, Klattasine etc.) where Category:First Nations history would be appropriate as well as either Category:First Nations leaders or Category:First Nations persons; there's also different cats like Category:Conflicts in Canada which may apply, or Category:Wars involving indigenous peopels in North America, which was specifically titled to allow inter-native wars as well as wars between native peoples and non-natives; and without the """"Native American"""" wording that that category at one time had",0
"""
Thanks for the support Grundle. No worries. I need to get some stuff done anyway. The claims of """"personal attack"""" and """"harassment"""" are bunk of course. But 2/0 has, unfortuntely (past experiences suggests he's a decent fellow) been quite active along with Jehochman in carrying out a reign of censorship against those with opinions they don't share. This abusive behavior is damaging to the encyclopedia and is anti-intellectualism of the worst kind, but not much different the Climategate nonsense we've seen. Dishonest, misleading, misinformation campaigns like these are very harmful to the pragmatic solutions to protect the environment, so it's pretty disheartening that somemthing I'm involved in, Wikipedia, is being abused to this extent. The dishonest manipulation of sources, the smearing, and the bullying cabalism are very discouraging. But the world is not a perfect place. I smiled at a few of the discussions on your page. Your good cheer, good faith and patience is an inspiration.

"cajuns, acadians
Cajuns, acadians, louisianans, they're so many different names for different americans of french descent because their culture is so rich and somewhat so different but so close at the same time. I'm an acadian but more importantly I'm a french american so I really don't see why there should be a difference. 

If you say there should be two different list, it doesn't make sense. The people on the french-american list should be in one of wiki-invented list of cajuns or acadians. I understand there are some more recent french-americans who are only 1 or 2 generations-old americans but this distinction isn't made for italian-americans, german-americans. I'm surprised to see Albert Einstein a fairly recent immigrant in American history next to Katherine Heigl, a 10 to 12 generations american. \\

"(UTC)
For the sake of anyone reading this in the future, expected value is actually fairly easy to determine.  A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = Expected Value.  On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053.  For 10,000 spins at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated.  

To determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1).  (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet.  If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.  As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout.  For example a street is three numbers so 36/3 - 1 = 11 therefore a street pays 11/1.    08:24, 17 February 2012",0

""""I understand the Fez Whatley is a character on a radio show, but your comments made it sound like they had introduced Jonah as Todd's son.""""

No, I specifically didn't say that, because that wouldn't be a direct quote. Listen to the show, and you will hear what I'm referring to. For him to make the statement you're looking for, he'd have to come entirely out of character which, even upon a heart attack, did not happen.

""""Don't insult my intelligence and act like I think Batman is real.""""

Looking back,I would have replied in the same way. Your spoke as if the character was an actual person, whether you actually believe that or not.

""""Even though Todd plays Fez on the radio, any article mentioning Jonah's father would probably say that he hosts a radio show.""""

I see precious little about his father at all, and made sure to look for some that would counter what was said on air before making any changes. Like I said before, if there was no information at all, I doubt I'd have changed anything. It was the information I saw that conflicted with what was said that I thought needed correction.

""""What was said on the show that made you be so confident that Todd was Jonah's father that you ran to Wikipedia to make sure it was on here?""""

Again, since you seemed to have missed it above, I didn't """"run"""" here to add the information. I only ran across this page in searching for what else Jonah had been in. The """"software"""" comment was what I found odd. The discussion between Ron and Fez, mostly at Ron Bennington's prodding, is full of references and allusions to Todd being his father. Since you listened to the show yourself, you should know exactly what I'm speaking of. The fact you don't even acknowledge this, has me wondering about your motives.

The only reasons I can think of for anyone to rebut what I've said, considering that I'm only relating what was said, is that Jonah's family prefer this not to be public, which I'd respect, or that people are just trying to support the character of Fez as a person.

This is actually a quite controversial case, though I admit that the label Belgian is a little misleading, """"Trappist Quadrupel"""" is not so bad. Stan Heironymous, in his very well researched book on Belgian Brewing """"Brew Like A Monk"""", writes about La Trappe, which was briefly a trappist brewery in the Netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a Dutch Brewing company. According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad """"specialized"""" belgian ales.

 I really find your argument unconvincing, since the style guidelines make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competitions with a beer that is not appropriately labeled as something else, which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all. Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great.

 Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.
 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )""",0

"WP:WEB

I don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture

Some articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.

As for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:

 Wikipedia:Verifiability
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view
 Wikipedia:No original research

The following guidelines:

 Wikipedia:Cite sources
 Wikipedia:Reliable sources

And the following tests:

 Wikipedia:Search engine test

Basically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information. WP:WEB is basically the condensed version of several other policies and guidelines aimed specficially towards websites.",0

What a curious block. I restored the original sources about those figures because somebody recently replaced them with sources that do not even talk about those figures.

Update re: """"public domain"""" in the United States
Some parting comments re: the two images; for those still seeking to document the licenses that reference """"public domain"""" in Poland and/or in the United States, one might want to take a look at the """"Photo credits"""" in the PBS (U.S. public television) documentary Website for its series Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State (2005); about a week ago I edited the article on the BBC program to include the source citations for the PBS broadcast of the same program (with diff. title).
(cont.) Today, while searching """"images of Auschwitz prisoners public domain"""" out of residual curiosity re: this matter, I located one photo credit referring to """"public domain"""" in the U.S.-published Website for the BBC program shown on PBS: it is a photo credit for """"Auschwitz prisoners"""" (not Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum/Wilhelm Brasse photographs, but photographs taken contemporaneously at Auschwitz in period from 1940 to 1945, depicting prisoners outside on the grounds of the camp at a barbed wire fence, e.g.: see Credits, scroll down to """"Auschwitz prisoners"""", and go to page 1 (hyperlinked) to see the photographs.  If PBS is citing """"public domain"""" in the United States, this might be a helpful precedent to cite re: Auschwitz photographs (taken by Polish photographers w/o copyright credits being given?).  Just a thought.
(cont.) I do not expect to be editing Wikipedia much if at all in the near future, so I thought I'd leave others with this possible publication precedent in the U.S. for citing U.S. (and possiblly worldwide) """"public domain"""" re: photographs of Auschwitz prisoners; though I am not sure it applies in the UK or European Union too; that would not matter if it applies in the U.S.
(cont.) The so-called duplicate photograph (3 poses) of Kwoka in the Wik. Commons file of same name is not exactly the same; it would be a good idea to rename the Wikipedia version as asked in the template to reduce possibility of deletion; the one in Wik. Commons still has the Museum captions in it and by virtue of that is possibly not in the public domain.  The cropped one w/o the Museum captions has a stronger argument for """"public domain"""" in the U.S.  (The one that is more clearly a photograph of the Museum-captioned photograph has a weaker argument as such, though I am not sure of that.  See the various discussions of the two images linked via the templates.) It is important to correct the conflict/problem pointed out via the templates of the duplicate names for images that have conflicting licenses/fair use rationales in Wik. and Wik. Commons.  If the images are determined by the reviews to be public domain in the U.S., they do not need fair-use rationales; they can be files in Wikipedia Commons (w/o Museum captions/the cropped version currently in this article) and not duplications w/ same name in Wikipedia (??).

 False & Un-substantiated Attacks on Arthur Freed 

Dear Wikipedia:

I am writing to request that the biography of my grandfather, Arthur Freed, be edited by removing the false, outrageous and unsubstantated allegations made first by Shirley Temple in her autobiography and then repeated by Aljean Harmatz in her book on the making of Wizard of Oz about my grnadfather conducting a lewd act in the presence of Shirley Temple at the time of his casting Qizard of Oz.

These allegations were made only first 50 years after they allegedly happened when Shirley Tempole wrote her autobiography and vented her anger over my grandfather giving the relatively unknown Judy Garland the part of Dorothy over very well known Shirley Temple.

There has never been a shred of evidence incdluing third party statements to substantiate these untrue and hurtful to our family outrageous charges.

Further, I see some idot has written on wikipedia about some previous editing of these false statements referring to my grandfather as a child abuser.

Wikipedia  as one of the Internet's most respected sources of information  should respect the foundation of American jurisprudence  """"innocent until proven guilty""""  and remove this ridiculous and painful statement.

If you wish to discuss this further with me, please contact me directly.

I would appreciate both the courtesy of a reply and to see that Wikipedia will correct this terrible injustice to my grandfather and our family by remocing totally unsubstantited false allegations.

The above statements about the essences of Nichiren Buddhism are which sects did what is a partial explanation; it is clear that it was composed respectfully by someone sympathetic to a particular sect, SGI.  SGI has a powerful voice around and world and has historically represented Nichiren Buddhism to important world leaders who sought it's understanding.  There are at least 2 other schools of Nichiren Buddhism: Nichiren Shu and Nichiren ShoShu.  These sects warn of SGI (but do not prohibit) it's practice; many feel that SGI inherently contains certain personality-cult rituals, and too frequently worship President Ikeda (the current leader of SGI) along with Nichiren and Shakyamuni Buddha.  Nichiren himself has said that he was not a Buddha, but an incarnation of Jogyo Bodhisattva.  The path of the Lotus Sutra is the path of the Bodhisattva  one who delays their own enlightenment until all other sentient beings in the universe have been saved from suffering.  Schools like Nichiren Shu do not believe that the priest should not be worshiped, nor the president, only the Dharma, the Wonderful Flower of the Lotus Teaching.  Several western nations have placed SGI on their respective """"Cult watch"""" lists, and in extreme cases family members have written letters to their governments for assistance in getting their relative de-brainwashed.

 Trinity 

Hi, Mark! I'm not committed to any particular wording. My concern is to find language that reflects the fact that there are more than a handful of exegetes that maintain that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament. They would admit, of course, that the term """"Trinity"""" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as """"The Angel of the Lord"""" and the """"Word of Yahweh"""" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, """"some"""" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way.

Zoe, thank you for the kindness of your reply. I can't help wondering if your answer is to the point, however, since my question was about the use of  in articles and the reference you cite is about the talk pages. Moreover, it seems not to discuss comments. DreamGuy cites the use of comments in Wica (see his edit summary). I might add Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. These examples suggest to me that some use of comments may be appropriate in articles. The Katrina article was edited frequently by many distinct editors. I don't think comments would have been retained without support for their use. 
I wonder if you might be willing to reply to my query regarding the comment wording (and caps use) that I proposed in my previous message?
May I say that I don't agree with the reversion by DreamGuy of your deletion of my comments? My preference is to resolve this matter through discussion and dialogue. Best wishes,  (talk)

As a gesture of good faith, I'm going to put the wording I proposed above into the article in place of my original wording. I think my original might be considered shouting because of use of caps. Zoe and DreamGuy, please show restraint and don't revert my wording for now. Once we've agreed on a final version, one of us can edit the article to suit. Zoe, is there an editor whose judgement you trust that might be willing to take a look at this dispute and comment? Thank you both,  (talk) 

 In fiction and In music consensus 

The consensus (painfully) reached here is that the In fiction and In music sections should contain short representative lists of the most notable instances of chimera in fiction and music (see the article edit history and the arbitration on the article discussion page). These sections should not include every instance since the lists would become so long as to have little or no value and would give the impression that such uses are more important than mythical or scientific uses. Wikipedea is not mere collections of internal links. See what not to put on disambiguation pages, as well.

Consequently, before adding to this section, please take the following steps:
be sure that the article that you are linking mentions chimera. We should not be sending readers that are looking for information about chimera to articles that do not mention the term. 
verify that your addition is at least as notable as the examples already listed and that chimera plays a major, not just a tangential role in the work. 
consider replacing an existing less-notable entry. 
justify your edit on this page.

Finally, if you disagree with my opinion of the consensus, leave your comments here. Please don't edit the article to make your point.  (talk) 

Page move request
To move the page to its classical Latin spelling Chimaera. It is of course a classical creature / concept, which has nothing to do with the US, so why should it be at a recent US variant spelling? -  
I think this is a reasonable argument. On the other hand, the majority modern usage is with the Chimera spelling, I think.  Google finds 3,230,000 (Chimera) v. 1,010,000 (Chimaera). If Google is an indication of use frequency among Internet users, a majority of readers will be searching for Chimera. That is a weak argument; redirects are relatively cheap, or so I think.  (talk) 
Gee, why should it use a recent US spelling? Well, there's Wikipedia:Use English policy, Wikipedia:Naming conventions policy that say we use the most common version, and a conspicuous lack of any policy that says Wikipedia:Use archaic Latin. We spell it the way it's spelled in the real world, it's a little thing called Wikipedia:Use common sense.

"'the press is free and will print what the hell they want.' the first proposition is dubious. What presses 'set fit to print' is often a calculated judgement on, what the owners prefer, what advertisers on them won't object to, and what the readership that buys the paper would prefer to read. As one sees at critical moments, in The Times of London, or The New York Times, reportage can be devastatingly skewed. This goes for the mainstream press. The second proposition has nothing to do with either comprehensiveness or accuracy of reportage, but rather 'who cares. I like it, I want the readership to think this way'. The Murdoch press is a prime, and notorious example. It's old book, but written by Walter Lippmann, Public Opinion 1921 (freely downloadable), but is trenchantly eloquent on ther 'pseudo-environment' in which we are constrained to live by exposure to media.

This is what a great humane, liberal newspaper man could write about what really occurs in media. At the time, that was a centrist adminission of how much bullshit is flogged to a gullible public to 'manufacture consent' at whatever price to the facts. His position is held today by Noam Chomsky, whom Lippmann's heirs regard as a dangerous man.

Impumozhi and his knowledge (or lack of) about rajputs
 

Incident 1: Impumozhi accuses rajputs of fabricating history on Hada page

Read this page for a little entertainment  in particular, the last three sentences, setting out the historical repurcussions of that hilarious (and probably fictitious) incident. Is this fit for an encyclopedia? Leave aside veracity, just the choice of words? Yet nobody dare change one comma or fullstop in that page: it is """"owned"""" by that presiding deity of obduracy, the learned protagonist of every page with a remote """"rajput"""" connection.

 Impumozhi's lack of knowledge exposed

His claim about Hada's character  being funny and un-encyclopaedic is actually taken from James Tod's Annals and Antiquities page 384 and 385 Vol-II: 
On the death of the queen Joda Bae, Akbar commanded a court mourning; and that all might testify a participation in their master's affliction, an ordinance was issued that all the Rajput chiefs, as well as the Moslem leaders, should shave the moustache and the beard. To secure compliance, the royal barbers had the execution of the mandate. But when they came to  quarters of the Hadas, in order to remove these tokens of manhood, they were repulsed with buffets and contumely. Then enemies of Rao Bhoj Hada aggravated the crime of this resistance and insinuated to the royal ear that the outrage upon the barbers was accompanied with expressions insulting to memory of the departed princess, who it will be remembered was a rajputani of Marwar.  Akbar, forgetting his vassal's gallant services, commanded that Rao Bhoj should be pinioned and forcibly deprived of his moustache. He might as well have commanded the operation on a tiger. The Hadas flew to there arms, the camp was thrown into tumult, and would have soon presented a wide scene of blood-shed, had not the emperor, seasonably repenting of his folly repaired to the Boondi quarters in person. He expressed his admiration (he might have said his fear) of Hada valour, alighted from his elephant to expostulate with the Rao...

If James Tod thinks this incident is worthy of being mentioned in his book, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, what is wrong in this incident being mentioned on Wikipedia?

 

Incident 2. Deleted the name of famous rajput lady, Maharani Gayatri Devi, from rajputani page, saying she is not a rajput.

His response: .

Impumozhi, on rajputani page deleted the name of Maharani Gayatri Devi . 
Then he was asked why he did so: .

His response was countered on his talk page:  and till date he has not responded. The reason he did not respond is because his lack of knowledge on the topic was thoroughly exposed.

 

Incident 3: Impumozhi tries to get the page of a famous rajput king deleted, but is thwarted.

In another incident he put a tag of db-nonsense on the article Hammir Dev Chauhan  . 
He was asked on the talk page of this article on why he put the CSD tag: . No reasons given till date. Another user, , had to remove this db-nonsense tag: . Here again Impumozhi had no idea about the subject matter but just because a rajput had created this article he put the db-nonsense tag.",0

I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the """"two species"""" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life. At least this way, people will find the article if they need to. Oh, and thanks for rescuing the conservation status of the Steppe Field Mouse.

Dear Sir:  
Wikipedia's rules for """"protecting"""" a page do not make a provision for using the tool on an editor's talk page, especially when the """"protect"""" is used as an added punishment.  One must wonder at the complete lack of moral fiber displayed when an administrator improperly utilizes a """"protect"""" on an editor's talk page, after repeat after, said editor had been blocked from further editing.  This violation of wikipedia's rules was further compounded by the administrator's failure to withdraw the """"protection"""" for nearly 24 hours after the block itself was removed.  In an attempt to cover up this """"error"""" the same administrator added the comments that he was removing the block, when in fact, he was actually removing the """"protection.""""  This gives rise to the notion that administrators who violate wikipedia rules are immune to sanction by their peers.  This safe harbor must give the vengeful administrator the feeling of  great power.  Sad, true, and very funny.

 Current Stock Capacity 

At the moment  the capacity of the 2009 tube stock on the Victoria line is 1164, more than the sub-surface S stock, which is more than a little dubious. The numbers in that column were taken from the old TfL web pages; I've just linked to archives for each one. This is why it says at the bottom of the table """"Capacity is based on four passengers a square metre.""""

I have a lot of sympathies for Mergism, but in this case, it's a bit tricky. A Structurist solution might be better here. I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with """"Main article: ..."""" just under the heading of each section. What I don't like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.

Although the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, """"preimage of the neutral element"""" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the """"General Case"""" section. (The """"Mal'cev algebra"""" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. 

Null space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.

Hmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.

"""JWs ==

Regarding the Jehovah's Witnesses material in general, part of the problem is getting independent reliable sources. We really can't treat sources published by the JWs as equal to independent publishers. For this sort of thing, I think the best ways to proceed would be to file a request for comment as per WP:RFC, maybe contacting any editors dealing with religion or Christianity articles in general, possibly on the talk pages of the relevant projects, or maybe leaving a message on the ethnic and religious conflicts noticeboard at WP:ECCN. And, as a small point, saying """"BlackCab, formerly LTSally"""", probably won't mean anything to anyone unless you indicate specifically why you consider that detail important. Otherwise, it might be more likely to raise questions as to why you think it important more than anything else.

"Mr. 68.164.117.79 I don't mean to be frank but your title does assert that SO is a de factor a country when only a handful number of countries recognizes it as such, The majority of the world still see it as a part of Georgia after all it was and is a civilwar. On top of that South Ossetians & Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation. This is also the problem logically, to call it as such, is to recognize the regional sovereignty of that area therefore confirming that the region exist but many speak of it which confirms it's existence now that the region is confirmed to exist what is this region part of? It is for the most part still the Georgian region its more to do with logic then POV. My friend Mr 68.164.117.79 I'm trying front with you whatsoever but that statement SO War doesn't make sense to me. However I think that the solution is probably like Pubkjre said in regards to the Vietnam article but this needs to stop any title can seem that it has a POV and can have great arguments to support it even though the title has good intentions so to debate it any further wouldn't do good, every informational data base has a bias its just a question of how much.Furthermore I'm going to also defend the google searches because it a good way to see how many individuals speak of in reference to, I am not saying that because everyone calls it as such then it should be so, but the easier it is to find the better as illogical as that sounds.In Summation I second Pubkjre we should have a Etymology page that way it will be clear on who is using what name and why.",0

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  

I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  

IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  

1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981

Panjab castes by Sir Denzil Ibbetson (1916) (http://www.archive.org/stream/panjabcastes00ibbe#page/n7/mode/2up) 
On Page 269, he states: """"Similarly, if the Ramdasias do not follow the occupation of Chamars, it is no reason to separate them from that castes. So if a Ramdasia is Julaha, that is a weaver, and if he is 'Bazzaz' that is a draper, his caste remains unchanged. If a Chamar, a leather-worker becomes a Sikh and receives 'pahul' to-day, he at once joins the Ramdasias. The Ramdasias do receive the daughters in marriage of ordinary Chamars, but give them 'pahul' before associating with them"""".........""""The the Ramdasi is still a Chamar"""". 
On page 300: 
""""The Sikh Chamar or Ramdasia. — It will be seen from Table VIII A that in the north and centre of the Eastern Plains a very considerable number of Chamiirs have embraced the Sikh religion. These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much 
higher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar. They are apparently as true Hindus as any Chamars can be, and are wrongly called Sikhs by confusion with the Ranidasias"""".

 One Buzzfeed article has suggested that this accolade has since been surpassed by Desperate Housewives. However, this claim has not appeared in any other mainstream publication and it has not been discussed by cast or crew of either series. While several of the main cast members of Desperate Housewives are female, two male actors, James Denton and Ricardo Antonio Chavira, have appeared in every episode of the series. In the title credits, the mixed-gender cast is credited together; in the first season, the series is billed as 'Starring Terri Hatcher', [et al], Steven Culp, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, [...] and James Denton'. By contrast, only female cast members, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, have appeared in every episode of Charmed and have been credited as main cast members in every series. The introductory credits bill the series as 'Starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano' (for seasons 1-3) or as 'Starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as """"Piper""""' (seasons 4-8), followed by supporting and guest actors. While several published monographs, including the Handbook to Life in America by Rodney P. Carlisle (Rutgers University) and the Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, have analysed Charmed as 'the longest-running show in history featuring female leads', no reference to this accolade in relation to Desperate Housewives has ever appeared in print. Aaron Spelling, Brad Kern, and the cast members, Milano, McGowan, and Combs, have all publicly recognized and discussed the accolade.

A source says """"civil violation"""".  Terjen keeps changing it to """"civil infraction"""" and it's not at all clear if """"civil violation"""" is the same thing as """"civil infraction"""" - it's safer to stick to the original wording of the source.
""""this civil offense should not be construed to diminish or qualify any other penalties to which an illegal alien may be subject"""" was added with a reference to the Immigration and Naturalization Act section 274D where residing in the US is identified as a civil offense, it also adds, """"Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish or qualify any penalties to which an alien may be subject for activities proscribed by section 243(a) or any other section of this Act"""".

Terjen continues to put the statement that residing in the US is a civil offense at the top of the paragraph.

"Relaunch 86

This was to judge by appearances. As theoretical physicist Robert Grumbold puts it, “It took two decades of IT to reveal what the Cantab editors were really up to, but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. Basically if each letter of a Cantab article is plotted as a point in an n-dimensional space, then you find that the piece on the piece on Benjamin Zephaniah, written in early 1988, actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψ-space. And the City Issue of Summer 1988 is decades, if not centuries ahead of its time. The uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist self-aggrandizement in the hallowed Cantab tradition. “In fact”, says Grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a 13-dimensional machine which time-locks a 9-dimensional black hole. We can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. But where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? Was it in the paste-up room cupboard? Had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in 1985/86? Is it true that at 1.41 am on 23 May, 1988, a packet of chocolate Hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? Why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? And why did so few people go into the nearby Indian restaurant and so many come out? Who or what was the Chief Editor, who subsequently disappeared in South America? Did (he) come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? And why does supernatural sleuth Mike Dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago, years after he’d left Cambridge? What is his dark secret? Had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? This is evidently one mystery too many, even for him….

I have opted to retire forever from this project and join the more credible project of Citizendium, where my new Associate of Science degree in Human Development might actually be useful to me as an editor in the areas of psychology and human development and counseling theories. I am shamed and appalled by the policies enacted on this wiki and its BRUTAL suppression of dissenting opinions. And I am sickened by your grabs for power and glory by re-writing history and claiming sole credit for Wikipedia, when the truth is otherwise. Dr. Larry Sanger's claim to co-foundership here is more credible than your claims of sole credit, and no not because he's the doctorate holder and you're not. I believe him because he reads more to me in my judgment more authentic about his feelings and he's more a straight shooter than you.

Re this block, I'm interested in the sequence of events. (I am not an administrator, so I don't know necessarily where to look, and I'm not sure what to look for either.) I followed this drama for a day. I was one of several people who warned the user that a block was likely forthcoming, which happened. The block was appealed several times until an admin unblocked (too soon, in my view but again, I'm not an admin). So shortly after the unblock, you identified the user as a sockpuppet.

Can you shed a little light on the sequence of events after the unblock, or that were occurring elsewhere while the block/unblock was going on? (I'll watch your page or you can email me from mine.)

Johnson, who intended to symbolically sign the bill into law during the Fourth of July week, then put his signature on the law just hours after it was passed by the House of Representatives on July 2.  The Voting Rights Act was also passed due to pressure from the Selma to Montgomery marches.  In secrecy, Johnson and King had organized the marches so that they would go beyond extending voting rights and advance War on Poverty legislation.

 Bosniaks 
Please google haplogroup I1b, and see if it reflects Bosniaks texts related to genetics, such as highlights that Bosniaks are firstly of Slavic genetic heritage.

 Question 

I'm working on an article about the Old Stone House in one of my sandboxes. I stopped by the house a few days ago and picked up a brochure for research. Some of the info is not accessible online (or else I'm just not finding it) and I'm wondering how I reference a brochure. It was made by the National Park Service, so it's definitely a RS. Also, I laughed when I read your comment and I responded. Thanks.  yada yada

The question is did Korean call continue to call these Korean women """"comfort women""""?

The paper is perfectly clear about about. Yes. Try reading it all. It documents many sources for decades after WWII. National newspapers.

Have you seen The Women Outside: Korean Women and the U.S. Military. Directors J.T. Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?

Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who """"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley"""".

Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

It says. """"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

  TABA 'polemic' is an aggressive debate, attack on or refutation of the opinions or principles of another. How on Earth is my contribution therefore a polemic?
Surely your own statement is more akin to a polemic?

You state that I 'hate English' for instance, which is a studied insult and a lie...but then if you intend to be aggressive I suppose that this is only to be expected.

You write;' """"English Medium"""" on the other hand means what any of the zillion pages that a Google search on that term tells you that it means'. 

Surely the point of my article is to explain what it means, something that had been lacking up until now in Wikipedia?

If you have problems with my so called polemic, then surely you can 'amend it' or 'add to it', instead of erasing it? 

Are you in favour of free expresion and the dissemination of knowledge or censorship and dictatorship?

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t 
I don't know what you are talking about. We were discussing whether or not the Soviets or Chinese would react if South Vietnam sent its forces to invade North Vietnam.  24 July 2005
""""I dont know what you are talking about."""" Well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|t 
Well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 July 2005
I'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.  
Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war. It's an honour to meet celebrities like you, Trey and Parker Stone. I appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the Vietnam War page. - .
well others watching this page are quite capable of RVing Marxist language and POV it seems.  
And would RVing 'capitalist language and POV' be ok with you? -|t 
I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia!

I hope that I don't seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy for the following reason: Your username appears to represent an organization that you are promoting. First, you shouldn't write articles about yourself, or your organization. Second, usernames must correspond to individuals (for legal license reasons), so having a username for your group would be against our policies.. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

There are several options available to you:
 We can talk about it, here. 
 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.
 Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

If we can't resolve this on our own, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.      """,0

I mean really, they are a new editor that appeared to be editing on good faith, adding information that was included in an already used source. Their edit summary didn't show any hostility, so you should not retaliate with any. Odds are, they haven't even looked at their talk page, so your comment won't be read anyways. If the act of reverting dubious additions from new users is stressing you out, maybe this is a problem you should see about solving, instead of acting like it is a personal attack on you. Plus, Antoshi already warned them on their talkpage, and they have not added anything since, showing that maybe they have listened to the advice. Your threat was completely unnecessary. Maybe explaining to them that the information has already been added, but rejected, and why would be a better option. 
WP:AGF and WP:BITE are very important. Like I said in the dispute resolution page, I don't mean to make any enemies. I think you are an amazing editor that does a lot for the project on many aspects.

Regarding your suggestion as to how the """"Disappearance"""" topic should go, the statement you provided should be listed under a heading """"Theories"""" and not """"Disappearance"""".  The editor for this page needs to be removed.  She has forcefuly edited out sourced documentation to promote the TIGHAR theory only.  The TIGHAR organization has dubed innocent amercians out of 15 million dollars to investigate a theory which so far has revealed no evidence at all.  Any evidence they promote could be found on any deserted island, anywhere.  However they choose to try and promote it as """"POSSIBLE"""" evidence as to the disposition of Earhart and Noonan.  It's terrible how our society as a people allow such conduct to be promoted as science.  Ric Gillespie needs to get a job and stop scamming people.  Regarding Gwen Gale, myself having changed the Disappearance to a more reasonable quote, she flat out said it was vandalism and had me banned. It happened very quickly without any conversation bewteen the two of us.  She is nothing more than a Nazi and a Communist.

[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1

Karamu High School
Hi Gadfium, thank you for starting the page on Karamu HS but a lot of the informaion is now out of date and the Karamu HS BOT will now administer information for the site.  Thanks  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.19.90   
You are welcome to edit the article, but you cannot control it. Please add only information which can be sourced. You also cannot copy information directly from the internet, unless that information is under a suitable open content licence, usually CC-BY-SA. For the section you have copied from the school website to be acceptable, you will have to place such a licence statement on that page. Otherwise, you are violating the school's copyright. There are alternatives, such as proving that you represent the school and have the right to relicence the material, which would have to go to someone higher in Wikipedia than me. It's much simpler to place a licence notice on the school website. You can also rewrite the material in your own words so no copyright violation occurs.

I suggest you always edit using an account, since your IP address may change and that makes it more difficult to establish that the edits are coming from the same person. You should also use an account representing a single person, not the whole BoT. See WP:ORGNAME.

Finally, you have a conflict of interest on the article. This doesn't prevent you from making purely factual edits, but you should not attempt to promote the school by, for example, using peacock phrases. It gets tricky if there is material critical of the school - in that case you should add comments on the talk page rather than edit the material directly. I accepted the removal of the section on the """"ERO crisis"""", which was unsourced and out of date, although quite interesting. That was not critical of your school, but I think it would have been more appropriate for you to have suggested its removal on the talk page rather than doing so yourself.-gadfium 

Thanks for the message.  Not sure where we go to from here or what is your motivation for this Wiki.  Are you a past pupil?  The BOT are confused why you are seeking to edit the Wiki when the school and the BOT are the legal owners of the school and its information.  Quite happy to stick within the guidelines of Wikipedia but who is making the judgement calls on what is relevant content eg """"generally regarded by residents as less conservative"""" where is the evidence i.e. facts to substantiate this claim?  Who decides Karamu's Alumni?  All information on our website has been written with BOT delegated authority and is the proprty of the BOT so no problems there.  Will follow up on other suggestions regarding edit accounts etc when I have more knowledge as still a first time user and know very little apart from the wiki page for KHS is simply not an accurate information page for KHS in 2010 and the BOT are not happy as democratically elected trustees of the school to have this continue.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 222.153.15.181   
I am not a former student at the school. I edit Wikipedia on many subjects, mostly to do with New Zealand. I am concerned that articles be accurate but I also make sure that no copyright is violated when material is added to articles.

You are probably correct that the BoT owns the school. It probably also owns the copyright on the school website. It clearly does not own all information about the school, and it does not own any Wikipedia article. We cannot allow anyone on the internet to copy material from the school's website to Wikipedia simply because they claim to represent the BoT, unless we have proof that they actually do so. To put any material on Wikipedia is to licence it under Wikipedia's Terms of Use, which is under a CC-BY-SA licence. I am not allowing the material to be added to Wikipedia verbatim without such proof, because I am protecting the school's copyright. The simplest method of providing proof that the material on the school website can be copied to Wikipedia - and any other publisher which wishes to redistribute Wikipedia's content - is to add a copyright notice to the page in question saying that the contents are released",0

"Anti-Punk Ignorant 

The above user who commented that a user who removed info regarding the punk rock article is absolutely misguided. That user is me. I never once posted that alternative rock did not come from Punk. I suggest that you get your facts straight. What I said was, grunge is not punk. I have been a hard core punk and a neo-punk since 1979. Since the early '90's, I've been involved in trying to revive punk during the grunge period of the 90's decade (while separating ir from influences of grunge). 

I will be blunt and unapologetic again... Punk IS NOT grunge. Never has been and never will be. Obviously from your answer, you do not know anything about punk, its fashion, history, or its influences. Punk is a genre in and of itself. It didn't spring from anything known at the time it was born; it obviously didn't come from disco and it certainly was not influenced by hippy music. I should know, since I have almost 30 years experience as a punk, have conversed with the inner circle of the punk greats, and even made recommendations to them in the early 80's. 

This anti-punk clown therefore clearly does not know what he is talking about. He doesn't know anything even remotely relating to punk. He accused me of stating that punk did not come from alternative music. To correct you, I stated that punk IS NOT grunge. Don't make this same mistake again because it demonstates your low level of knowledge in this area and hugely dents your credibility. This shows that you do not like punk for some personal reason which wiki and I find very disturbing. Calm down. You are not correct in your statements.",0

Hi - two or more stub types which you created have been nominated for deletion or renaming at Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion. The stub types (templates or categories), which were not proposed at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, do not meet the standard requirements for a stub type, either through being incorrectly named, ambiguously scoped, or through failure to meet standards relating to the current stub hierarchy or likely size, as explained at Wikipedia:Stub. Please feel free to make any comments at WP:SFD regarding these stub types, and in future, please consider proposing new stub types first!

It is worth noting that stub templates are virtually never created for independentist regions until such time that they are recognised internationally by a significant number of countries, as these stub types tend to become the targets of potential edit-warring (something which has far more far-reaching effects on templates than it has on articles). Thus, for example, there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus, since it is only recognised by one country. If Abkhazia and South Ossetia become recognised by more than just one country, then feel free to propose the creation of stub types for them. Until then, it is generally accepted practice with stub sorting for them not to have separate stub types. ...wha? """,0

 Gabrielle LeDoux 

I really did have more to say about Sharon Cissna.  It's probably nothing more than a series of moot points, seeing as how her campaign has gained approximately zero traction.  If she's even shown her face here in Fairbanks, I'm sure I would have heard about it, and yet I haven't.

 Just saw your post a minute ago. I haven't had any time to look at Wikipedia in a while. You're quite correct. I defer to your more extensive fund of information on AK politics. I'm not sure why Sharon wasted her filing fee. There has been zero campaign, reflected in the lack of traction. Phone messages left for her after her announcement and e-mail both went unanswered. I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter. Actually, I'm thinking he's actually more like that bag lady from FBX who ran Senate, was it, about 20 years ago.  Sylvia something? If Alaska were Nevada, """"None of the above"""" could sweep the primaries and general elections. You live in Fairbanks? I had no idea. I thought you were a Washington State radio person or a punk rock band -). Given her name recognition, I expect she might win the primary if the party doesn't put out a mailer for Matt.   

Now, on to Gabrielle LeDoux.  Once again, big gaping holes which require addressing.  First, Kurt LeDoux ran for Kodiak's Senate seat in 1982 as a Democrat, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Bob Mulcahy.  Gabrielle LeDoux was herself a Democrat for many years, including originally filing as such in 2004 before switching to the Republicans at the last minute.  

 I didn't realize she had switched. I haven't paid much attention to Kodiak since Zharoff left office. I do remember that LeDoux hugely outraised Ogg, with most of her money coming from lawyers and labor from Anchorage. Can't remember if she had a general election opponent. She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  

Second, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.  Contrast the Petersen-LeDoux race with the first race in the new district in 2002, when media accounts specifically pointed out the deep roots that both Tom Anderson and Owen Carey had in East Anchorage.  

 Thanks for all your input. Please feel free to change or add.  I doh't have any ownership in Sharon's page.   

 """"Carpetbagger"""" is a term that originally meant moving from a Northern state to run in the Deep South, after the Civil War, didn't it?  Moving a few miles in Anchorage would seem to be a bit of a stretch, to warrant that label.  Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?) Not nearly as big a to-do as Tuckerman's first massive gerrymandering attempt in 1992.   """,0

"I have randomly sampled many articles in the [[[Featured Articles]] page, which are some of the best articles Wiki has to offer (wow, some are good!). (N.B., I don't see PETA listed.) I found that many articles have criticism sections. Many have controversy sections. Many have Trivia sections. The articles provide all the info the reader requires in a well-laid out format. Look at this one: Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for example; I could care less about what the article says (as with PETA, to be sure) - but I care deeply that it says it all and it says it right. The crtisicsm/controversy sections do not seem to be attracting undue attention in those articles.

Yes, I understand that the technical proposal is to rename the article, but I also appreciate that names matter.  It's also worth noting that this is the longest rename discussion I've ever seen at WP.  Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks the name of this article matters more than usual.  

I may be missing some very notable exceptions, as I have not been involved in the dispute until now, but I see no unbiased editors.  I see editors who either support the concept of men's rights or feminists.  That is to say, without belaboring the topic, I see two diametrically opposed ways of viewing the world.  One way says men of every society in every corner of the world developed abusive and patriarchal social structures that oppressed women.  The other way says that gender roles evolved by men and women working together in accordance with biological imperatives like survival.  That these gender roles limited, benefited and oppressed both sexes in different ways by forcing them to conform to the roles that society dictated.  Feminist patriarchy theory has a fundamental need to attach male malice in the way gender relations evolved and inculcate guilt in modern-day males for the supposed sins of their male predecessors.  Tangential rant aside, if we can appreciate that there are two opposing sides here we can achieve a much better and balanced article.  But, instead, what we have on one side are a bunch of feminist editors, armed with all the sources that 30 of feminist dominated academia can churn out disingenuously feigning to be unbiased, disinterested editors who are merely trying to apply WP policy to produce the best article possible.  On the other side, we have the men's rights activists.  """"Men's Rights"""" are, essentially, what men's rights activists say they are.  If the article, """"men's rights,"""" doesn't have at least 50% of its content from sources that point to """"men rights activists"""" (a term that I see used pretty pejoratively on the """"Men's Rights"""" talk page) then the article is hopelessly biased.  All feminist sources regarding men's rights are, essentially, sources that respond to the arguments and/or actions of men's rights activists (male or female.)  To base more than 50% of the article on the feminist response to the article's topic is a poor way to write an article.  Such an article can easily occur here if we try to stick to the best WP:RS without including both sides (because we have failed to acknowledge that there are, in fact, two sides here,) as we will end up with an article that amounts to """"Men's Rights according to Feminists.""""  The reason for which being that the men's rights activist source may be from some small publisher or self-published but the women's studies text will be published from Oxford Press.  """,0

"""A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

Conversely, some of these articles were started by long-standing contributors and you should respect their experience about what is and what isn't a valid encyclopedia article. I think it would be best for you to either stop doing newpage patrol or seek counsel from someone who has been doing it for a while. While I appreciate you trying to help, the fact is that wrong speedy deletion tagging is quite damaging (for the reasons explained above) and time consuming for admins who often have to go back and explain the mistake to new users.

Fusion-Mutiny

The Fusion and Mutiny played more games than are listed on this page.  Their rivalry lasted from 1998-2001.   

 Rowdies vs Miami Toros? 

Any thought to expanding this rivalry to include its pre-history, the 1975 and 1976 NASL Seasons when the Rowdies played against the Miami Toros, who would become the the Strikers? If we are including MLS matches, this notion would also seem logical to me. Cheers to all! -  

Original research
I know there's been a lot of earnest work here, but the premise appears to be entirely original research. It combines information and scores for every team from the two metropolitan areas, whether there was any real connection or not. The original Tampa Bay Rowdies were not related to the Tampa Bay Mutiny or the modern Tampa Bay Rowdies/FC Tampa Bay. The original Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami Toros were not related to the second Fort Lauderdale Strikers, the Miami Fusion, or the third Fort Lauderdale Strikers/Miami FC. And of course several of those were named for or played in Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. I doubt that any source outside of Wikipedia has ever pulled them all together like this. Most of the sources used here are either self-published blogs, or they just give information on individual teams or games; they don't make a claim about an overall rivalry lasting since the 1970s. Unfortunately, this article may need a total reshifting in focus to keep it. t/c 

Allow me to address your areas of concern about this page:

THE EARLY YEARS: 1975–1993: Perhaps you did NOT read the newspaper accounts cited in this page of the very first meeting between the original clubs in 1975? Four minutes into the match and the players began to brawl! Yup, no rivalry, that. The Toros moved to Ft. Lauderdale in 1977, so from 1975–83, it was always the same two teams playing. The original Rowdies lasted until 1993 and all of the subsequent Striker teams in that era had numerous NASL-era Strikers playing for them. That is part of what carried the rivalry on during those lean ASL/APSL years. The other cited references span the years right up to the two franchises that play under the names Rowdies and Strikers in the NASL of today. Many were published by the local media in the two markets, some were done by the MLS and some by the new NASL. Are these not varied and reliable enough for your tastes? Or are you suggesting that every single article on the rivalry topic over the past 38 years needs to be cited to prove a rivalry existed and continues to exist? 

BLOGS AS A SOURCE: A quick count of the sourcing shows 37 of the 91 cited sources are from blogs, etc. Even by the broadest of definitions (i.e. 50% + 1), this is not """"most of the sources"""" as you state. It would be more accurate to say many of those blog citations are used only to verify final scores or attendance figures. Again are you suggesting that every np article on every match be unearthed to confirm the scores? Until the USSF sees fit to publish the recap of every sanctioned match in US history online, resources will remain a hodge-podge. Nearly all of the narrative of the page in question is supported by information published by reliable media outlets. Closer examination will further show that even some of the blog sourced material happens to be previously published np photos and/or articles that were scanned and posted in the blogs.

MLS era: In the MLS years, the Mutiny had several former Rowdies working in their front office staff, one of whom, by the way now happen to work for the current Rowdies. Both they and the Fusion had former NASL-era Rowdies and Strikers as their head coaches at one time or another. The Miami Ultras were originally the Fusion's supporters. They now follow the Strikers. The connections were always there. As a matter of fact, inclusion of the Mutiny/Fusion era",0

Hi Rob, my guess would be editors who sympathize with the British position.  Collins is something of a hero to the British and the Protestant right wingers in Ireland (and are remnants of the former Protestant ruling class) since he signed the treaty to end the Irish War of Independence that created the Irish Free State.  Sinn Fein and the IRA, the left wingers and Catholic, were against it and viewed Collins as a traitor.  The Civil War resulted.  The IRA assassinated him.  The treaty allowed the British to still subjugate the Irish.  Lloyd George and Winston Churchill were ecstatic.  Eamon de Valera and Sinn Fein were not.  They wanted a Republic and to be rid of the British entirely.  The British and the Irish Protestants are still big Collins' fans.

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous.

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

"""== Early Chicago computer club ==
Hi, thanks for all your efforts!!!

Not sure if you wanted me to answer via your talk page. 

AFAICR (made that up - As Far As I Can Remember) the Chicago computer club I was involved with was C.A.C.H.E., the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists Exchange. 

I believe there was a meeting approx Apr '75, begun by Robert Swartz, who was lucky enough to be able to affort a """"Digital Systems"""" original 8080 """"box"""" - and the CP/M operating system.  

(Digital Systems was right up the road from Gary Kildall (the CP/M guy)so they got together.  - One making a rugged box and the other the OS for it). 

The """"hobby"""" as I see it really took off with the MITS Altair on the cover of the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. 

[Back to Chicago Club] SO one day reading Pop'tronics, I noticed a piece saying there had been a computer club in the Chicago area, naming the people who attended, and saying when the next one was.    As I recall it was Lloyd Smith (now my best friend) formerly of Dyer IN, and Bill Burther, Valparaiso IN (R.I.P.).  

SO we rode together to that possibly 2nd, or perhaps 3rd meeting (? Sept 1975) and I was hooked. 

MY involvement with the club was to be an """"active participant"""" in that for ex. I was sec'y for many years, wrote programs to maintain the mailing list, help with the newsletter, often whipping up a small newsletter myself when no one else helped (this was one of the events that led to the invention of the BBS).  I brought my system in to show, back when maybe one in 10 actually HAD a system. 

My home system consisted of an Altair 8080, to which I had added a Selectric Typewriter and Dynastor FLYING HEAD disk drive (a whopping 256K, yes, KAY).   I had to (1) teach myself digital electronics; and (2) design and create the board to interface to these uniquely-mine peripherals (Ex: Type a char on the selectric (terminal) and watch what came in - on an oscilloscope) THEN program the altair to """"produce outputs that matched that timing"""", learning that  gasp IBM put the parity bit at the opposite end of the word than most of the rest of the world!)

My machine also  once """"video"""" became available (I skipped the """"TV Typewriter"""" phase), a 16 x 64 display called a Processor Technology Video Display Module.  (and no coincidence, the BBS Randy Suess and I invented and I programmed, had a 16 x 64 size message limit at first). 

THEN my world opened to assembler programming (not hand assembling or some other hack) when Processor Technology came out with a paper tape-distributed editor and 8080 assembler.  (I seem to recall it having 4 things, but don't recall now.)

I modified the PT Asm to run on cassette tapes (The """"Tarbell"""" having become a standard) and called the combination of things the """"CACHE Cassette Operating System"""" (CCOS) and several people in the club started writing assembler programs.  

SO anyway, the club had a huge variety of machines represented - from the """"boards"""" - Kim-1, ?? Trying to remember if the Apple-1 was a """"board"""" - I think so and the little Sinclair """"pocket calculator"""" sized ones from TI or with a TI chip.  

When the Radio Shack computers came along, many of us pioneers thought """"this is the end of the hobby"""".  What we meant was, for example (maybe an extreme example) - I could design and make my own boards, AND write the BIOS routines to run them, etc, and THAT was more the fun - so someone buying a """"built"""" machine seemed kind of sad.  However, this is the march of time, and I'm sure the """"Hams"""" (amateur radio enthusiasts) felt a bit the same way as more and more products came along making it easier and easier to """"talk over the air""""..   I eventually - and somewhat delinquently - adopted the PC, but by then had pretty much """"burned out"""" programming as a hobby, and did not make a LOT of contributions in that area. 

____ END _____ of my thoughts on the club, is this what you were looking for?  

Just to """"come to a better close""""  the fact I'd done my own HW meant incompatability, so I invented MODEM.ASM (named  and it stuck  Xmodem by Keith Peterson) to be able to """"beep"""" things back and forth with friends; 

Then the BBS came about as ME thinking a dial-in system to gather articles for a newsletter, but Randy Suess suggested a club project would be """"by committee"""" so just the two of us - him HW and me SW - did it, independently of the club.  — Preceding unsignedcomment added by  (talk • contribs)

Yesterday I noted a slanderous reference, linking the Canadian Red Ensign to Neo-Facists groups.  I did not appreciate the reference, not one little bit.  I posted some information in that regard.  Specifically a web-site link to the Great Canadian Flag Debate.   The Canadian Government uncharacteristically saw fit to keep an accurate archive, detailing those important events.

At any rate, you decided to remove my """"contribution"""".  However you decided to leave the """"disputed"""" reference linking the Canadian Red Ensign to the Neo-Facists groups.  I was not pleased that you choose to remove my """"contribution"""", and then decided that the Neo-Facist comment could stay.

I decided then, if my comments were to go, then the Neo-Facist comments were to go as well.  I thus have deleted them.

I don't usually get involved in things such as this, but Heraldy and Vexillology are two of my dearest passions.  So, my comments are gone fine, but why was the Neo-Facist comment left by you?

 Real truth Kargil WAR 
""""kargil war had two phases""""

Kargil war on the ground (phase one):
Pakistan gave stick to Indian forces and showed them the gutter. President Musharraf was the hero of this war. Indian lost thousands of elite soldiers without achieving anything. There were minimal Pakistani casualties and Pakistan gained control over huge areas (most peaks in the area) with Indian forces in Kashmir vulnerable. 

Kargil war on the table (phase two):
India complained to USA, Nawaz was called by Clinton and Nawaz (God knows for what reason) surrendered and thus agreed to withdraw from all areas Pakistan gained (hence in effect making a victorious war into a lost war). Actually, Nawaz declared to Clinton that all occupying Kashmir on Indian side were not Pakistani soldiers (thus denying them status as Pakistani soldier), regardless, Nawaz also agreed that he will use his influence on them to make them retreat. During this retreat (or withdrawal), Pakistan lost number of men that volunteered in this war.

Result:
Pakistan won the war on the ground (phase one) and lost the war on the table (Phase two).

 Harassment by user  

I have been constantly harassed and offended by the user , and I would like to know what measures can be taken against this kind of behaviours. I am involved in an ongoing discussion over the article Copacabana with this user, but it seems that his actions have extrapolated as of recently, and he embarked in a crazy campaign of difamation and verbal abuse in several pages, including my own:
'Defamatory and slanderous accusation made by Rsazevedo against Hu12
'Rsazevedo offended and ridiculed me
'Defamatory and slanderous accusation made by Rsazevedo against Hu12
'Defamatory and slanderous accusation made by Rsazevedo against Hu12
'Defamatory and slanderous accusation made by Rsazevedo against Hu12

I appreciate any help in solving this problem, which is quite annoying to me. I am shocked and saddened to discover such childish behaviour in Wikipedia.",0
"Medium Pimpin & Live Prayer 

Hi Merope,

I guess my article about Medium Pimpin is NN so I will give up.

I would like to ask you about the article on Live Prayer however. Yesterday I added a section about a number of prank calls to the show which had been made by TOTSE members. It seems this is quite controversial and there was a lot of vandalism in the article after I added this section.

Now the section has been removed. Why was it removed? There was nothing wrong with it, it cited references.

Is Wikipedia influenced by vandalism? If enough outraged forum users vandalize Wikipedia will we hide the truth? Surely isn't right.

I'd add the section again, but I can't because this is a new account and I lost the password to my old account.

Could you perhaps add it for me? (^_^)",0

It has been suggested that not all evil is due to a privation; malaria, for example, is due to not a lacking, but an excess (in this case, of disease).[6]

I agree with Lisa that the first sentence should make a positive statement that describes what Judaism's view is, not vaguely describe what the view is like.  Lets look at the topic sentences of some recent versions.
Judaism's view of Jesus is a very peripheral one. fails completely. Not describing Judaism's view at all.  The second sentence Jews have traditionally seen Jesus as one of a number of false messiahs who have appeared throughout history. is worth considering, but think it is not informative enough. 
Judaism's view of Jesus is largely defined by the Jewish principles of faith, rejecting any view of Jesus as divine """"Christ"""", or """"son of God"""". falls short, being too hesitant.  perhaps simply.Judaism reject any view of Jesus as divine """"Christ"""", or """"son of God"""".
Judaism has no special or particular view of Jesus, with very few texts in Judaism directly referring to or taking note of Jesus, and disputes all Christian interpretations of canonical Jewish scripture that allegedly make reference to him. does a decent jobs but the lack of text reference and disputing Christian interpretation are not really the most important things for an intro.

"Article upgrade assistance request (Pre-translation stage) 

Seasons Greetings,

This is in reference to a relatively new umbrella article on en-wikipedia named Ceremonial pole. Ceremonial pole is a human tradition since ancient times; either existed in past at some point of time, or still exists in some cultures across global continents from north to south & from east to west. Ceremonial poles  are used to symbolize a variety of concepts in several different world cultures. 

Through article Ceremonial pole we intend to take encyclopedic note of cultural aspects and festive celebrations around Ceremonial pole as an umbrella article and want to have historical, mythological, anthropological aspects, reverence or worships wherever concerned as a small part.

While Ceremonial poles have a long past and strong presence but usually less discussed subject. Even before we seek translation of this article in global languages, we need to have more encyclopedic information/input  about Ceremonial poles from all global cultures and languages. And we seek your assistance in the same.

Since other contributors to the article are insisting for reliable sources and Standard native english; If your contributions  get deleted (for some reason like linguistics or may be your information is reliable but unfortunately dosent match expectations of other editors)  , please do list the same on Talk:Ceremonial pole page so that other wikipedians may help improve by interlanguage collaborations, and/or some other language wikipedias may be interested in giving more importance to reliablity of information over other factors on their respective wikipedia.  

This particular request is being made to you since your user name is listed in Wikipedia:Translators available list.

Thanking you with warm regards",0

I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called """"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,"""" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax"""", or """"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation."""" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the """"""""Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident"""" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk """,0

"Well, the only thing is that I can only make any sort of promises for myself; I can't guarantee that some other editor won't come along and strip the unsourced stuff out again anyway. The problem is that there've been quite a few major incidents on here in the past few years, with the consequence that we've had to really tighten up our content rules — we have to be a lot stricter now about what we can and can't include than we could get away with in 2005, because we're under a lot more pressure and scrutiny than we were back then. So we have to be a lot more careful now than we did five or six years ago — and unfortunately, sometimes that does also mean we have to delete stuff we previously could have kept. Truthfully, being actively involved around here is as much of a pain in the arse for us as it is for you — we're not trying to be mean or anything, but keeping things under control around here is practically a full-time job on a good day.

It is unacetable to label something held as sacred to half the world (Jew+Christian+Muslim), This is not Censorship but common sense. The instability of This article since i think an acceptable middle ground would run something like

""""Creation according to Genesis refers to the text found in the opening two chapters of the book of Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew Bible. This text has been identified as a creation myth by scholars,[1] and has religious significance for Christians and Jews."""""""" (AFA Prof suggest two months ago)   
 OPPOSE """"Creation according to Genesis"""" implies reality, it is inaccurate and in disharmony with other articles about other creation myths. This article is not religious propaganda. We have already discussed this at great length and we will not have a small minority of editors force their ideology down everybody's throats.  .
 According to Genesis is just what it is. if people want to take Genesis and take it as literal fact that is their prerogative.   

''

 Cush, I think you're shying at shadows - does anyone think """"Creation according to the Rig Veda"""" would imply acceptance of the Vedas as history or fact?   
 Support - It's high time this POV-pushing sham of a title was put out of its misery and restored with something more sensible and less partisan. The current title was only chosen for the sake of its offensiveness value. I think the few editors who insisted on this title have already received all the mileage reward they're ever going to get, hope they enjoyed it.   

 OPPOSE Why does Christian-judeo religious belief deserve special treatment? The genesis creation myth clearly meets the definition on the Myth page of wikipedia as a """"sacred myth"""". We haven't gone around changing Greek Mythology to something like """"Heros and gods according to ancient Greeks"""". Christian Mythology refers to this as one of a body of myths. Myth: """"academic use of the term generally does not pass judgment on its truth or falsity"""". Myth: """"a myth is a religious narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to",0

 Advice 
We cannot display copyright material, even temporarily. The blanking template on the article gives you a link to a temporary page where you can draft a new article. Please note that:
Minor rewording is not enough to avoid a breach of copyright - see Wikipedia:Copy-paste
You will need to establish notability, a requirement to have a Wikipedia article, which is not a matter of opinion but must be demonstrated by showing """"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject."""" Significant means more than just listing-type mentions; reliable excludes Myspace, Facebook, blogs, places where anyone can post anything; independent excludes the subject's own website, affiliated ones and anything based on press releases.

As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a """" hog and pig"""" in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: """"As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue"""". I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.

YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is """"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body"""" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)

"""==Passion Killing in Namibia==
Introduction

In the Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary, passion is defined as a very powerful feeling, for example of sexual attraction, love, hate, anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder. In this context Passion Killing is combined.Passion Killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger, love, hate or other emotions.

In the past passion killing in Namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend. Recently, a large number of continuous Passion killing cases have been reported. So far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women, breakups and infidelities being 2 of the main reasons amongst many.In this article I’m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society, who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence.

The causes
The question on everyone’s lips is, “why are men killing women?”

 Amongst many causes, the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support, for things such as accommodation, tuition fees in a case of a student, food, clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case, men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits, the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women.The Namibian, 2012Namibian

 Another major cause that leads to Passion killing in our society is infidelity from women. When a woman cheats and the men finds out, the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing.

 A possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women.Causes

Who is at fault?
As I have observed, both men and women are to be blamed in different cases.

Firstly, certain men are at fault are because they don’t seem to understand the real meaning of love. """"The country should cry out for help. True love is patient, love is kind - it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.. Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, 2012 

Even if love is not involved, as it is in some cases, one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property.In other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it, In the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing. 

Women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost. But little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life. 

Women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons, be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface, then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties. 
Either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing.

Recommendations
Recommendations 
The solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this Nation. Knowing the diversity of people, it’s hard to figure out what would impact certain people.  Never –the –less, the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on. Informante
A number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty. But I believe one cannot fix another evil with evil.""""So what is the exact answer to the problem, should we bring back the death penalty? Will it stop the passion killings?",0

You  are under the influence of a severe WP:COI attack. Remember a COI could be spotted not only by defending but also by attacking a particular project/idea (like you are doing here).
You have erased (I think it was you even when that edition it is not signed) the independent links that support the inclusion of SERVA in this page. You have erased links to articles written by many different people from many different languages, you have erased the kind of link you couldn't provide for supporting the projects that you are SPONSORING here.
My proposed changes are based in facts that you cannot take (and dare to erase); You are PROMOTING projects here; you do not provide independent sources, then I do not have to convince you. You are definitely biased here.

I want to report  for erasing the research material I have included when supporting one of the projects ERASED by him in this page.

1)  systematiclly refuses to provide the bases for supporting COBBLER inclusion. He does not have/know how to articulate the support for the mentioned project. I encourage talk to finally provide to the WP community the supporting material for the inclusion of this project here. He is the one that systematically forces the inclusion of this project; it has to be him who knows and proves to the community the value of the mentioned project. My guideline based argument for removing COBBLER is that that project it is not representative of the PXE state of art.

I want to report  as a biased editor whose behavior could be very well understood under the terms of WP:COI.

2) You cannot say ditto; the guideline based argument for removing EL TORITO  was clearly stated before; you are definitely not WP:LISTENing here. EL TORITO has nothing to do with PXE.

3) Again a magnificent display of WP:COI; your COI. You are trying to twist things putting the blame on me but that will not change facts: There is no independent material available for supporting the inclusion of ERPXE. Peroid. Again it is YOU who scream COI here while supporting one of your projects. Bring the material and I'll shut up. If not it isn't me the one that has to shut up here.

4) your WP:COI is amazing; you cannot take defeat; and no matter what I write you want to promote the projects that you want while banning SERVA. If I bring links you erase the links, if I bring facts and arguments you call me """"dead horse"""". You do not care about WP you just care about not bending your arm. You have no clue about PXE but you pretend to rule how the PXE page is written based on your guts feelings and personal taste. SERVA was included here for long time and it was you who take it down.I think you were just too far.""",0

There are significant differences between being a lay person / lay leader / lay preacher / lay pastor, and being a 'pastor' within the Baptist church. The article should reflect the difference accurately by describing Mr Stanton as being amongst the laity.

The article does not claim novelty, since the German movement was initiated in 1950. I think that the main value is to consider that the human action in forest should only be to help nature do more quickly the process it would make slowly by itself; and as a result the idea that to manage a forest as an ecosystem has sense also from the economical point of view, as it reduces operating costs. Needless to say that the article is open to incorporate any additional information, particularly concerning US practice and experience, and help balance it.

"""What are you arguing about? Did you read? Symantec, McAfee and a few more are of course security experts, and they did show concerns about the security about Windows Vista, as stated in the article. If you spend some time to search, you can also find more security experts who are complaining about the new security features in Windows Vista. There are more negatives about the new security features in Windows Vista and is available in many articles on the net. Google is your friend.

After all the whole passage is a lot of fragment and the article is poorly written. It is no difference to some copy and paste work (after some content filtering of course!) without any organization, making it very messy and hard to read. They should learn how to write an article properly. You can easily find a better article than this mess elsewhere.

I tried to see if I can rewrite the article so it makes some senses. Start your article with an introduction (abstract) so as to give a concise overview. Improve the structure and flow of arguments.  Of course I get stopped out before I can finish it, and be warned that you will be banned soon if you continue. It is how it works as a collaborative editing nature of Wikipedia - someone who can revert without explanation and edit without discussion, but others must get approval from him before they can edit. The draconian style is really how Wikipedia works.

Perhaps one of the worst thing in the article is that  insisted the quoting style above must be perceived. If all quotes needed to be done in this way, he should quote all. However  selectively quote two only in this way. First this makes the page unnecessarily bloated. Second, why do you want to stick out two quotes only? Third, by sticking out two only, this can draw readers' attention, and pretend that it is an authoritative or more trustworthy statement (so readers may discard or pay less attentions to other statements).

"Translation

Being exposed to the two traditions, I am unable to decide which one covers best the definition.How we define freedom itself depends upon various factors - culture, education, environment and individuals own understanding on where the voluntary freedom ends and the legal begins.However, let us see how the French definition reads into English.I admit, this falls beyond my area of specialisation and could possibly be literal in places

Freedom is the sense of acting according to one's own will without being restrained by the power of anyone else.It is defined 

negatively as  the absence from submission,servitude,constraint exercised by someone else.

positively as: the autonomy and spontaniety of a rational being;the voluntary human behaviours are based on freedom and qualified as Free

This notion is seen as an abstract and normative value of the human actions and at the same time like a solid reality.These two perspectives are interwoven in many ways and could lead to errors of categorisation.There are, therefore, numerous confusions that can arise with respect to the term Freedom.So,it is necessary to distinguish the different sense of this word.

The Freedom could be taken as an attribute of the Human Being, of his will and be the condition of natural and positive rights, but also his duties;the effective realisation of the voluntary acts has a dimension that could not be possible without the later.These two ideas of Human existence are not necessarily compatible.For example, the existence of Legal Freedoms can be felt, while its reality (existence in our acts) and its essence (its conception that we have) poses problems.  

The first point could be addressed in a Socio-Political research; the second point constitutes its metaphysical base and particularly the Philosophical understanding of Freedom.This article is divided into two parts to facilitate this understanding.The first part covers the Philosophical aspects - treating the metaphysical notions of Freedom and the second part - the Sociological aspects.However one should keep in mind that the two aspects are interrelated.

Speedy deletion of Dj elijah
 A tag has been placed on Dj elijah requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"""

You've made three mistakes:
 
Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

Grizzlygus1 - I believe criticism sections are almost always going to be inappropriate in Wikipedia. Just about everyone has somebody who disagrees with them about something. Some, like outspoken atheists, will have more than many from conservative religious parts of society who disagree. That's a given. We cannot possibly list all the criticism, so what's the point of listing any? We should just describe what's significant about someone (i.e. why they have an article here) and let others decide on the merits of their actions and views. The same goes for people significant for their strong religious views. List those views, and let it stand. Going any further will inevitably create the debate of """"how much further?""""

 User:Slrubenstein and other's falsifying and defamatory edits 

User:Slrubenstein who obviously does not like the word 'theory' (and didn't like the article from the beginning) has repeatedly edited the article adding falsifying terms like 'proposal' instead. Nowhere does Carotta """"propose"""" or """"claim"""" anything. Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out. He has not answered the questions raised by someone above concerning his problems with this article either.

Now this excellent User:Slrubenstein has even gone so far as to """"protect"""" (i.e. block, prevent editing) the article altogether. I think everyone involved in this or just reading here should seriously ask themselves whether User:Slrubenstein who canvassed against the article, voted for stong delete and most emphatically defamed the author as """"crackpot"""" (this might be actionable), is the right person to further work on this article let alone be an admin in control of it.

User:Rbreen who also voted for strong delete and who has already been convicted of lying and destorting scholarly statements above, now thinks he is the appropriate authority to judge on Carotta's undeniable and never before denied classical scholarship. He obviously knows better than reputable scholars like Piñero, Canfora, Kavoukopoulos, Simon and others. Here's your typical Wikipedia editor.

Nothing new can be said of User:Iblardi either. He helps wherever he can to degrade the article and defame its subject.

User:EALacey is not even capable (or is he not willing?) to correctly translate the word """"Wissenschaftsparodie"""" into English. The correct translation is """"science parody"""". Another typical WP editor, it seems.

I don't even want to talk about User:carl.bunderson. Some quotes from the Gospel come to mind...

"Jotamar, I think that your arguments have become very poor after I showed what kind of scholars are members of the RACV. The true Scotsman paradox is based on the fact that no one can define what a true Scotsman is, but it is very clear what a scholar is and in which fields a scholar is specialised, so I don't see in which way the true Scotsman paradox can apply here. If you are speaking of, say, biology, you can give the opinion of experts in biology, but I don't imagine anyone giving the opinion of a Nobel prize in economy for a discussion on biology. When someone refers to the opinion of scholars when talking of a certain topic, it is very clear that scholars specialised in that topic are referred to, so in an article on a language as this one, I find a real nonsense to mention the opinion of scholars in fields totally unrelated to linguistics. I would make the change I did at the beginning: just to delete the statement saying that a minority of scholars support the RACV theses. This is an article about a language and the opinion of scholars with no relation to linguistics shouldn't be considered here, so if we stick to linguists, there is NO scholar who supports the RACV theses.",0

The focus of the animation is the CMYK model, which is a mathematical abstraction, and not the device dependency of any particular print process. I consider it helpful in the same way as the animations at the articles RGB color space and YCbCr are in explaining a 3-D volume that can be difficult to visualize from a static drawing.
 We cannot show subtractive ink colors accurately but that does not mean the article cannot have diagrams. The colors I used are the same as here and here i.e. 125 colors uniformly filling the displayable range and mapped to the CMK space. Note: this is not perfect, there is no gamma correction and linearity is assumed. If anyone likes to propose a different colour law in terms of 24-bit RGB shades, I can see about putting them in the animation.
 Just noticing that it is a spinning object tells the viewer it is something in 3-D. It helps to notice that the cube rotates about its diagonal which is the K axis. Then one understands the geometry.
 The goal is to give a qualitative visualization of how ink densities are coordinated like dimensions of a space. a) In principle three inks can define the whole gamut which is therefore a cube. The article explains that black ink is added to """"save money on ink"""" and to address the inadequacy of affordable CMK inks in very dark tones.

I think it is a forlorn expectation that any Wikipedia diagram can provide colorimetrically accurate color swatches. It is correct to show that the CMK trio of subtractive inks work, to a good first approximation, as orthogonal variables that define a color space.

jacobolus has ideas for further geometric diagrams of the printing process that should be helpful if they are based on reliable sources. May we hear more?   """,0

re German Pigeon Club Links
G'day Mate, I guess what I'm trying to say by wanting them footnoted is that """"External links should not normally be used in the body of an article"""" as per that style guideline. Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text.

"i don't see where any of the book references have anything to do with yugos. i guess the books may have yugo references in them, but if they do, that should be so stated, exactly, or else the refernces to books is POV and unverified. and who is this conscensous on the porsche thing? who forms the conscensous. if i and other people with no real knowledge about programming start an article, and wipe out any corrections, as your editors have do here, do they get to form the conscensous? and if you, who are an expert on the subject edit it, and they roll it back, is that okay with you? you can not have website claiming to be fact. yet that is compiled by people with a Npov, with an axe to gring, or who repeat rumors, affecting peoples lives and livlehoods. this is what wiki editors did to John Seigenthaler. i am sure you a familiar with that. i used to live in san antonio, and being an anglo, i have a point of view on racism in SA. should i pubish an article, or edit an article on sa? i could prove that it is a problem. but i wouldn't do that, because i am not a expert on race relations, or have a degree in sociology, so i don't have a right to pubish that as fact as wiki publishes articles about people and things. you can not just let a bunch of people publish what ever they think in a public forum where some people are going to take it as truth because you call your self an encylopedia. and wiki articles are blindly republished as truth in othe online content. so it is not my legal threats that matter. it will be resolved on a much higher level that mine. this whole thing is why bill gates doesn't make windows open source. wouldn't that make your job so much fun, when anyone can change the operating system at any second?",0

 Račak incident 

Hi Noah30, thank you for your note on my talk page. However, I was only reverting vandalism. I did not intend to become involved in the debate on this article. Regards,  

Hello again, you're not disturbing me. You've laid out your case on the talk page today. I would suggest waiting a week and see if a discussion develops. Regards,  
For Christ's sake, {{wikify}} means to format the text as for any wikipedia article, boldening the title, adding headers, copyediting, etc. What is your point adding it to Racak incident article?!? Please have some rest and leave my talk page alone. If you actually want to learn how to properly archive yours, check the help pages. talk 

You have hated me since day one but the fact is that I do not understand why; how can you hate someone you have never seen. First you called me sock puppet, and now remove everything I do. Abuse of adminstrator authority. Calm down  

Hi Noah, I do not know exactly what your problem is but I assume you have troubles assuming good faith. Around five months ago, I thought you could be a sockpuppet of Hipi Zhdripi, given your similar edit patterns and command of English. I was wrong and apologised to you at the time. This does not however excuse you making horrible accussations against me or insulting me in the way you have done on my talk page. If I were indeed """"abusing my administrator privileges"""" that have been trusted to me by wikipedia community, I would have actually blocked you myself. It is not my intention to block you or have you blocked. It is for this reason I have reminded you of the ArbCom ruling and so on. If you want to carry on with disruption of the like of marking a properly formated article with a wikify tag to prove a point, it is up to you. Regards, talk 

Hi again, I have asked univolved editors at the neutrality project to have a look at the articles, including the titles. Hope this helps. talk 

 Massacre vs. Incident
I will be reverting the title of the Podujevo article to Podujevo massacre. Generally massacre is used for """"individual events of deliberate and direct mass killing, especially of noncombatant civilians or other innocents without any reasonable means of defense"""". As Racak is still unclear, this is why this is called """"incident"""". Regarding Podujevo, I can not find anyone disputing the civilian nature of the victims, therefore I think that it is better to keep the original title. Regards, talk 
I have copyedited and wikified the Podujevo massacre article. Hope you are happy with the result. Please note that I think you made a mistake regarding Goran Stoparic, as he was not involved in the killings. He actually testified against the two Scorpions according to the CBC article. Regards, talk 
I also edited Gornje Obrinje massacre. Please note that the text needs to read """"allegedly commited by Serbian forces"""" as no court case has been brought. talk

I also support to move to the philosophy page. I would comment further, but Yworo has said pretty much everything. The statistics are wrong due to the redirect forcing users to go to the operating system first; and the operating system (along with everything else on the disambig. page were named after the philosophy. While the OS may be the primary topic for north american and european users, you cannot say the same thing for the people of asia or africa or anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, Yworo is correct. Wikipedia's guidelines aren't written in stone. Read WP:BURO and WP:BATTLE. In Canada, the Supreme Court ruled in one case that the laws of Canada (or any nation) aren't black-and-white, but rather a series a guidelines for which to abide by, leaving room for interpretation and circumstance.

Isn't it what you ususally say each and every time? specially when dévoilé? and isn't it also what you do together with imposing a title when I write a thing who is too true too close to what you can't accept?

"Edit history merge possibly required 

Hey, I noticed you moved the Iran assassination article to a more appropriate name (although depending on how allegations play out perhaps the investigation is broader and the media will provide a convenient shorthand)... but i just wanted to make sure that any history from the prior page would be appropriately merged into the history of the new page, to comply with licensing terms. In other words. Articles A and B were created and B was merged into A, and then A was renamed to B, which means that all of the contributions need to be registered in the edit history to comply with copyright requirements.

I've got no opinion right now on the name... I was surprised how long it took to create the first article actually, I almost did it myself... but I think that in some time there may be an obvious confluence of a few investigations so they can be comfortably grouped under one heading.

Traditionally, Canada's Aboriginal peoples hold that they have resided on their lands since the beginning of time, while archaeological studies support a human presence in the northern Yukon from 26,500 years ago, and in southern Ontario from 9,500 years ago. The first Europeans to arrive were the Vikings, who settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around 1000 AD, after which there was no further trans-Atlantic contact until John Cabot explored Canada's east coast for England in 1497, followed by French explorer Jacques Cartier in 1534. In the early 17th century, Samuel de Champlain founded the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal and Quebec City, from which the French colonists extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and the present-day Maritimes, while French fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. Concurrently, the English established fishing outposts on Newfoundland and established the Thirteen Colonies to the south.
'' on the Plains of Abraham at Quebec in 1759, part of the Seven Years' War.]]

Due to the close proximity of these two European powers, a series of wars over both territory and the fur trade errupted between 1689 and 1763, such as the French and Iroquois Wars, the four Intercolonial Wars, and the Seven Years' War. Via the peace treaties that concluded these conflicts, Acadia and most of New France was ceeded to Britain, which then, through the 1763 Royal Proclamation, carved the Province of Quebec out of New France, annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia, and placed all the former French territories under common law; six years later, St. John's Island became a separate colony. By 1774, the Quebec Act reestablished civil law in Quebec and reaffirmed the right of its population to practice their Catholic faith, as well as expanding the province's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, all of which helped to fuel the American Revolution. From that conflict, some 50,000 persons loyal to the Crown fled to Canada, where new regions were created to accomodate them: New Brunswick was split from Nova Scotia, and Quebec was divided into Upper an",0

""""The situation surrounding his assasination continues to be murky, while he reportedly was assasinated by Nation of Islam officials, he also had many enemies in the United States government. It is widely believed that the government also had a role in the assasination.""""

I am no expert on the man but I have checked several reliable sources (E.g. """"Malcolm X""""  Encyclopedia Britannica.  1990 Ed.) and they don't say anything about a government role. I am not saying that the viewpoint is untenable, but I don't think 'widely believed' is correct.

If someone more knowledgeable on the subject doesn't do it in the next day or so then I will (I am hesitant to leap in as I imagine that this article can be controversial).

Also, it's spelt Assassination (unless us Aussies are out of step with the rest of the world on that one – happens occasionally.)

"If the KLA had a Tactical Victory, they would've completed their strategic goal, if they had a Decisive Victory, they would've killed almost all the Yugoslav Army troops, but the truth is, they have killed around 50 or 30 or 45 Yugoslav Troops. Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles. But the truth is, that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles. The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia, Greece, and I believe Yugoslav volunteers. NATO was involved, but had about six Aircraft (B-2 1, F-16 2, and AC-130 2), I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used, but didn't inflict casualties, but for the F-16, I believe inflicted casualties 8. So Yugoslavia had less casualties than the KLA because regular troops are stronger than Militias or Guerrillas because they have better handling and training on weapons and hand to hand combat and have armored weapons and tanks and many more. The KLA only had guns.",0

I think you are doing a lousy job polluting valid information with complete garbage. So, I will no longer link to the wikipedia Clan Davidson """"article"""" and will link to the correct history: ACCORDING to the Highland manuscript believed to be written by one MacLauchlan, bearing the date 1467, and containing an account of the genealogies of Highland clans down to about the year 1450, which was accepted as authoritative by Skene in his Celtic Scotland, and believed to embody the common tradition of its time, the origin of the Davidsons is attributed to a certain Gilliecattan Mhor, chief of Clan Chattan in the time of David I. This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson. Sir Aeneas Macpherson, the historian of the clan of that name, states that both the Macphersons and the Davidsons were descended from Muirich, parson of Kingussie in the twelfth century. You suck, and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but I'm sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view.

"I will be glad to help and will copy edit those articles in due course. With regard to the inclusion of Sayedani Maa Tomb - I'm not contesting the merit of the structure. I agree that it is a heritage stucture of significance. So is All Saint Church, Trimulgherry. This church has even recived the INTACH award from the erstwhile HUDA and ASI.

If you are insist on including a picture that you think is of real importance to the article, I will also insist on adding the above two pictures which I believe are of great importance as well. The point I am trying to make is that the article Secunderabad discusses several aspects of Secunderabad and not just architecture. The number of pictures in each section should be proportionate to the length of that section. We have enough pictures for the section on architecture. A mention and description of important structures should suffice.
As for the other pictures you have pointed out. I beleive the picture of Garden restaurant has nothing to do with advertisement. The restaurant is a local landmark and is therefore of significance. Pictures of locally famous restaurants are often featured in wikipedia articles about cities. Refer Cafe du Monde picture in New Orleans. The Tankbund road picture is also significant. It is an important thoroughfare in the city which acts as the main arterial road that connects the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderaabd.

ah, I'm not a woman from Yorkshire. Me mam is, so I have to watch a lot of her stuff. That was the point. Try keep up. As I am not at all a fan I cannot quote endless lines off the top of my bonce, but dinnerladies, for example, I found to be blisteringly unfunny. One example I was forced to view the other night saw one actor do a really long boring monolouge about christmas, the only laugh of which came from the word """"Miss Farnesbarnes"""" - which wasn't even pronounced humorously (like Rowan Atkinson could with """"Bob"""") - and that reminded me of something I saw where Julie Walters got all luvvied up in an interview about how Victoria uses masterful word play. I was left thinking if this is an example of """"masterful wordplay"""" Walters could benefit from watching Blackadder, Chic Murray or anything Eric Idle or Ronnie Barker ever touched. It's a vaugely silly word deliviered by a wooden actor (it was one of those ones she always surounds herself with so they don't steal her limelight)

Then there's one that always sticks in my head for sheer crapness about marks and spencers who's """"trousers are dropping off"""" (i.e. declining in quality/falling down). Now where is the humour in that? It's just a pointless, witless, bottom of the barrel seaside postcard humor that would make Julian Clary cringe. I know bum/trouser jokes are an aquired taste but The Young Ones, French and Saunders, Monty Python, Morecambe and Wise, Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson - they've all managed to construct a well thought through and vaugely witty bum-joke. Simply suggesting that trousers can concieveably fall down by way of an unrelated pun is neither sharp nor funny. 

Finally, my fave, on Parkinson or something like that she told an anecdote about a time she was in a resteraunt and some pissed old lady started saying to her family """"look that's victoria wood! I'm going to go over! I'm going to go over!"""" then she approached Wood and said """"I've come over to see you"""". Now even a comedian with good delivery would have trouble making that one funny, but Wood just sort of stumbled through it.

"I am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. They say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure.",0

I don't want to 'sneak' something into the article, I swear by God. Jewish Encyclopedia does have POV. Making connection between 'how one group of people treat the others' and 'their ancestors' are made in Bible (not by me). It might seem strange, but that's how Bible views things (forgive me if I'm wrong). Now, I found it interesting to include this POV into the article (i.e. this connection between Muslims and Jews). Mainmoinds refers to Muslims as Ishmaelies (if I am correct). Itsmejudith, I've been subject to a harsh block for reasons which I still don't know.

European Hearing: """"Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes""""
On 8 April 2008 a European Hearing entitled """"crimes committed by totalitarian regimes"""" took place in Brussels. This was organised jointly by the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission around the two key issues of recognition of the crimes and reconciliation. 

The aim of the Hearing was to contribute to attaining a greater knowledge of these complex issues and to enable an exchange of views between independent experts, representatives of national institutes and NGOs dealing with these issues. 

Member States, Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Council of Europe were also present.

""":::""""#The one where you add """"and sometimes unfortunately"""". You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of """"brochure speak"""" is """"antagonist speak""""; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is """"weasel"""" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. """"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - """"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000"""".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.  If you don't like the statement that points out the reality of the situation, then we should remove the claim completely.

""""#The wholesale removal of the section on rhythm in the kindergarten. It needed revision, but not removal. I would replace it with something like: """"Waldorf early-childhood pedagogy believes that clear daily and weekly rhythms are essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security. [citation] [reference to the elements of this rhythm] It also believes that both the seasons and festivals relating to the course of the year provide central formative experiences.[citation]"""" This is a huge part of Waldorf's approach to early-childhood education and needs mention.""""  I don't disagree that this is part of the pedagogy, but the wording has to be concise.  """"Essential for the child's healthy development and emotional security"""" - you sound like Donald Rumsfeld with your terrorist scare tactics here.  Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying """"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important""""?  What you wrote above is the type of brochure speech that riddles this article and makes it impossible to view it as other than a advertisement.

""""Others of your edits I have already revised and a middle ground has been found; this process will continue, I would expect. I have not been reverting your edits generally; only blatant editorializing (which I have sometimes managed to convert into something meaningful)."""" Your """"middle ground"""" and mine are in very different places, my friend.  Blatant editorializing is what my edits have been removing.  Just because I haven't had time to go back and re-word what you believe you have made """"meaningful"""" doesn't mean it has any validity in this article.  As long as you, a Waldorf teacher, is here making this article """"meaningful"""" - there will be no end to the controversy here.

""""The tag should go because it is presently unjustified, as you all agree; it is inaccurate in its present form; why are you advocating keeping something that is not accurate? If it becomes accurate, it should go back; that's easy enough to do."""" Nobody agrees - as far as I know, with what you have said above - although one polemic editor besides yourself did remove the tag.  The tag is completely justified.  Here's the next paragraph that needs brochure speech removed: 

""""According to Steiner, the child at this early stage learns through imitation and example,[4] so in Waldorf it is considered best to surround him with the goodness of the world and caring, practically active adults to emulate. The curriculum attempts to awaken the child's will and initiative; the teacher has the responsibility for providing an environment that stimulates imitation. In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided. Oral language development is addressed through circle games (songs, poems and games in movement), daily story time (normally recited from memory) and the range of practical activities.""""

And there are more and more similar paragraphs that require lots of work.  I'm sorry if it is offensive to you as a Waldorf teacher, to find out that lots and lots of people besides you feel it is best to surround children with goodness.  In fact, maybe you should point out schools who, as their goal, consider it best to surround children with something other than goodness.  There is absolutely no justification for removing the tag while this type of language fills the article.  There was, at one time, a promise of a re-write of the article (most of which, I belie",0

 GA review of Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat 

Thank you for your time reviewing the article so far. I was hoping you could give your quick input on the following two things:
I tried expanding the lead a bit, but now the problem I'm running into is that it's hard to summarize each section of the article without simply repeating information that appears later. I suppose this is a consequence of the article being short to begin with. Any advice?
Concerning your comment about drifting between singular and plural language, I'm not sure how to avoid this more than I already have. I tried to use singular (""""Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat"""", """"the bat"""", or """"it"""") wherever possible but in some cases I felt it was necessary to instead use plural for nouns like """"colonies"""" and """"populations"""".

"""==Unsubstantiated claim by a single KGB member does not merit lengthy paragraph==

Checks and Balances in the Articles for Deletion Nomination Process
There needs to be better checks and balances in the process of how articles are currently nominated for deletion, to prevent notable topics from being deleted without actual qualification per Wikipedia article deletion guidelines. This is a significant problem, because it is very likely that notable topics are being injustly deleted. It's easy to nominate an article for deletion and then type five or six words and wait to see if an article will be deleted, whereas it takes more time to refute nominations. Perhaps there should be more sophisticated criterion to nominate articles for deletion. As it is now, anyone can nominate any article without providing a just rationale for doing so, and can instead simply base the nomination upon basic, generic and inspecific statements such as """"doesn't pass general notability guidelines"""", while not specifically stating which parts of the guidelines they are supposedly referring to. If nobody comes along to correct an injust or baseless nomination, the article is then deleted based upon unqualified, general statements that don't actually correspond with the required source searching per WP:BEFORE prior to nominating an article for deletion. This definitely makes it very easy for people to censor Wikipedia, for whatever subjective reasons. Here's how it's done: an article is nominated for deletion and an AfD entry is created, a generic rationale is provided to misqualify the deletion without actually checking for reliable sources to establish topic notability. Afterward, if nobody comes along to correct the faulty nomination, the article is deleted. It's also easy for people to message one-another to delete articles, often per an """"as per nom"""" rationale, while disregarding the actual notability of topics. If nobody comes along and provides an objective analysis to refute the deletion of an article in which the topic is actually notable, nominated per generic statements and without the required source searching prior to nomination, then the article disappears. Hopefully Wikipedia can introduce better checks and balances to prevent this type of easily accomplished, simple censorship. One idea is to include a requirement prior to article nomination for deletion in which the nominator has to state, or check-box on a template, that they've performed the required minimum search in Google Books and in the Google News Archive required by WP:BEFORE, and in Google Scholar for academic subjects, as suggested in WP:BEFORE. This would be a simple addition to the AfD nomination process that would add significant integrity to the process, and would also encourage users to follow the proper procedures.

What I changed on the Quadric (projective geometry) page was simply an incorrectly directed link to a disambiguation page.

Rock or pop?
I know it says rock and roll here, but the red album really does sound very teeny-popish. My music collection only has room for single genres (as in rock or pop, not rock/pop), so which one is it really?  

It's rock  

Actully, it is pop not rock. I aggree with  that it sounds very teeny-popish. Rock and roll is the same thing as rock. I think a lot of people shorten it as it sounds a bit cooler.  | I will respond.  

 Many problems 

In addition to three items I tagged as  that appear to contradict what I can verify about the album, the table smacks of OR, and even then, some of the info in the table is incorrect.

As far as I can determine, both 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 were compiled by Allan Steckler, an employee of ABKCO (Allen Klein's company), which at that time was managing Apple Records in the United States. The Beatles had no involvement whatsoever with any aspect of the albums. Indeed, they came out in the United States about two weeks before their UK release. Also, the two albums were compiled, at least in part, as a response to a heavily promoted bootleg, The Beatles Alpha Omega, a 4-record, 4-tape set that came out in 1972 and was even advertised on television in the U.S.; the boot's availabiliy made the point that there was no true """"greatest hits"""" collection of the Beatles available in America at that time.  

 Choice of the colour red 

I have removed the claim that the Beatles chose the colour red for this album to show support for Liverpool F.C. Aside from the fact the other album is blue so we might as well suggest that indicates that they must be Evertonians, it's unsourced and extremely unlikely to be true. There has been a request for a source and none has been provided. In fact, there is no source for the claim that the Beatles helped select the tracks or helped with the album design at all (I seem to remember reading that McCartney did but not the others, though they may have done I suppose). Forgive me if I am wrong, but the suggestion that the Beatles picked red to show support for LFC sounds as though it's been made up by a Liverpool fan who either assumes this is the case or would like others to think it is. Some Liverpool fans like to proclaim that the Beatles were keen Liverpool supporters when in fact there is no evidence for this and almost certainly no truth to in it whatsover, and it's interesting that the contributer in question did not go over to 1967-1970 to make any similar reference to the choice of the colour blue indicating the Beatles' affection for Everton FC. Fact is, only one of the Beatles were even remotely interested in football (McCartney) and strictly speaking, he is an Evertonian (although he maintains he supports both clubs). Ringo, according to the Guardian, is an Arsenal fan. Neither George or John had any interest in football whatsoever and it is unknown which if any team they favoured, even there families don't know, although Harrison did seem to imply once that he supported Tranmere Rovers rather than Everton or Liverpool (Lennon added a Liverpool player, Albert Stubbins, to the Sgt. Pepper cover but later said he only did so because he knew he was his father's favourite player and that he himself actually knew nothing about Stubbs). There is a remote possibility that if the group were involved in the album's design that they may have chose red and blue in reference to the two Merseyside football clubs, but if it is so there should be a source for this and it should be made clear that this was not a show of support for one club over the other, which gives a false impression (whether intended or not).  

 I agree.  | I will respond.  

 Unauthorized Beatles compilations before """"1962-1966"""" 

Hi, anonymous user here. I found out about a 4-LP set called """"Alpha Omega"""" that was a Beatles compilation sold through infomercials back in 1972 that supposedly got EMI to compile the hits onto """"1962-1966"""" and """"1967-1970"""". But some people claim that the """"Alpha Omega"""" set was withdrawn from the markets since it wasn't legitimate.

Does anyone else know about this? 76.214.41.70

Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name """"Wikipedia"""" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning """"quick"""") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. 
I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?

 Wikipedia Ambassador update! 

Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. 

You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.

Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.

If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.

Please do these steps as soon as possible
First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:
Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile
Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile

Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).

After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists """"Current"""" courses, but you can change the Status filter to """"Planned"""" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)

As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.

Communication and keeping up to date
In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:
 The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.
 The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.
 If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.

Ambassador training and resources
We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)

Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t",0

If it was always called Olzstyn in Polish, I stand corrected. I was perhaps confusing it with Ketrzyn, formerly Ranstenburg. (Is this a transliteration into Polish of Allenstein, as Frombork is a transliteration of Frauenburg?)

However, before 1945  the town was known to non-Poles as Allenstein, as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest. Witness also the League of Nations plebiscite in southern East Prussia, which as shorthand was referred to as """"the Allenstein district"""" (Cf. Churchill's memoirs).

"The SPLC’s Outright Telemarketing Scam
PUBLISHED BY MICHAEL OLANICH, ON MARCH 31ST, 2015
telemarketing2014

ONE MONTH ago, we gave the Southern Poverty Law Center the benefit of the doubt concerning their dubious telemarketing practices. Today, with the release of their 2014 IRS Form 990 tax report, we cannot cover for their outright telemarketing scam any longer.

On the right is the SPLC’s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2014.

For the fourth consecutive year, SPLC Founder Morris Dees, who bills himself as a “sound steward” of the donors’ money has deliberately scammed tens of thousands of well-meaning donors through his network of paid telemarketing rip-off artists.

To wit, for the past four years Mr. Dees has continued his relationship with Grassroots Campaigns of Boston, Mass, despite the horrific hemorrhaging of donor dollars. Grassroots has cost the SPLC hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars each year for their fundraising efforts:

2011:  -$212,214

2012:  -$869,686

2013: -$1,156,765

2014:  -$1,130,680

How in the world can Mr. Dees continue to deal with a company that has blatantly siphoned $3,369,345 donor-dollars out of his coffers over the past four years? These horrendous figures more than wipe out every dollar raised by his other telemarketing cronies, not that that amounted to all that much.

Checking out Telefund, Inc. of Denver, we see that they raised $561,102 in the name of the SPLC  in 2014, and only pocketed $422,292 in fees, leaving the SPLC $138,811, or a whopping 25% of the donation money.

Did anyone tell the donors that Telefund was pocketing three quarters of their donor-dollars?

But that’s all chump change compared to the experts at Harris Marketing group, who raised $213,694 in the name of the SPLC and “fighting hate,” and only pocketed $192,928, or a mere 90% of the money donated over the phone.

And yet, Morris Dees could not be happier with the results because Grassroots, Telefund and Harris all sold their information to him. For mere pennies on the dollar, Mr. Dees buys solid donor leads that he can feed into his own uber-efficient in-house fundraising machine at 100% profit down the road.

Best of all, it was the stupid donors who unwittingly paid to have their information sold to Mr. Dees. You really cannot beat that for “stewardship.”

Dees will lose money on the deal this year, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions he stands to gain from these donors over the coming decades.

But think about it. In 2014, Mo Dees paid $2,537,027 to third-party telemarketers to raise $1,979,272 in donor-dollars, meaning that the telemarketers kept every last dime they solicited over the phone in the name of the SPLC as well as an additional $557,755 out of the SPLC’s existing donor till

THIS is “sound stewardship?”  At $100 dollars apiece “only” 25,370 of the 2014 donors got screwed out of their donations. A mere pittance. At $50 dollars a pop the number jumps to more than 50,000 suckers, and yet, Mo Dees calls this “sound stewardship?”

Justify it anyway you want, but at least 25,000 well-meaning donors got screwed out of their money, just as they have for the past four years.

It’s time that the media and the IRS investigates the criminal scamming of the Southern Poverty Law Center. This is nothing less than blatant fraud. Selling the suckers one thing and giving them something far less.

An Afd process was commeneced by me aganst page ah-ni-yv-wi-ya.  The Afd process concluded with Karmosin putting forward views that the page should be redirected and merged.  The majority rejected his views.  After the Afd ended, Karmosin vandlaized then blanked the page in question, then out of retaliation flagged a page which had just completed Afd that morning for a second Afd process.  I want 1.  the Afd revered on page Gadugi and Karmosin sanctioned for violating wiki/Wales policy of We Are Nice People Who Do Not Act This Way.  On his user page his lists himself as a """"rebel"""" which isn't something that fits in with Wiki's peaceful honeybee meme.  While I respect all peoples right to their views and opinions, after an Afd completes, nominating pages out of retaliation in an attempt to oppress the majority is improper.  I would like this user punished for 1) violating policies and 2) wasting yet more of my valuable time answering stupid and frivolous Afd requests and 3) interfering with me writing more articles.""",0

 As per tour request and the outrageous mendacious accusation from others.  

As per your request I have made it clear for  and any of his associates that he has not been subjected to legal threat - he is so inventive in covering up his own errors and fails. 

As it's not clear is there anywhere else I need to post and advisory? 

I have to make clear that i do not welcome his repeated attacks upon others and his abuse of Wiki to empower himself. His behaviour is such that It drives editors away and as there is still an ongoing issue with editor retention that may been to be addressed. 

I will not be responding to his misbehaviour - but should be continue his abuse and bullying I will refer him to a list he has inspired on a personal wiki page. I so wish that Wiki would get with the issues of Cyber abuse and put in place correct portals and systems to protect individuals - and not just admins. That bias is so anti-diversity and sitting in the very heart of wiki. What is the best way to get such a deficit addressed and ensure that people attacked and victimised through wiki can be secure in knowing if they report it is handled securely and with respect.

This morning, a wikipedian moved this page to a version including the full Vietnamese diacritics.  I just moved it back to the version without diacritics, for the following reasons:
 this is the English-language article about Ngo; and the great majority of English text written about Ngo (and other Vietnamese generally) do not include diacritics.  In English, in fact, inclusion of the diacritics is of no effect (at best) or even confusing because they have no effect on pronunciation in standard English orthography.  (Please note I am by no means an English-language bigot: I am a student of the Vietnamese language, and understand the fundamental role diacritic marks fulfill in correctly differentiating phonemes in Vietnamese.  However, it is clear that in English, the diacritics play no role in pronunciation.)

That makes it ruinous to Nintendo's Zelda franchise by creating brand confusion, and it could hinder future marketability of these games in the same way as emulation. Programs like these may be all in good fun to fans, but they are taken seriously from a legal standpoint by their copyright holders, and it is both disrespectful and dangerous to assume otherwise.

Simply because Nintendo has not communicated to you about Zelda Classic does not mean that you can presume they have granted permission for the use of their copyrighted material or trademarks. There have been numerous claims in the original Wikipedia article and talk pages that Nintendo either condones or endorses Zelda Classic's existence, but no proof has ever been provided for these statements; only conjecture.

 Islamophobic material 

A cursory examination of the content of the blog shows a great deal of openly islamophobic material, in contrast to JIDF's self-description as purely opposing anti-Semitism on the web and even the moderate material is overtly slanted in a hateful direction. For example, a headline in response to the Fort Hood massacre is """"It's Islam, Stupid"""". It also supports conspiracy theories that Obama is a """"secret muslim"""" . It also shows [Kahanist] tendencies, posting memorials to controversial, racist anti-Arab figures such as [Meir Kahane].

So far the JIDF has managed to fly under the radar, but it is only a matter of time before notable sources pick up on the hateful content of this site. This can and will be reported on Wikipedia.

Ernie Smith writes 

Æµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators.  That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.""""  I went on to state that """"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.  The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric..."""" 

Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii).  So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language"""" does not make this practice Afrocentric.

To User:DESiegel

I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the """"N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).

In Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  """"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?""""  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

 And some more 

The first section is a standard greeting, its friendly and it may contain some information that is useful to you. As you will see these messages will flag either on your email and/or at the top of the page next time you log in. Editor to editor messages not about a specific page are usually done this way.

To answer you question. I put ticks to show how we can join the dots but can only do it through reliable sources if you are not sure is something is a reliable source you can always ask at WP:RSN (reliable sources noticeboard).

Perhaps an example of what you can do with your sources is the easiest way to go. In my sandboxes|sanbox]] I am many others developing an article on  one of the players in that was a man called Francis Windebank (Royalist soldier) as Wikpedia had no article on him, I created one based on the text in the Dictionary of National Biography for his father  see Wikisource:Windebank, Francis (DNB00). To do this I had to extract the article from an OCR version that is kept on Wikisource and put place it where it is now. So having put in the work to extract the article about his father I added said information to his more famous father's article Francis Windebank  With me so far? (BTW. We can copy copyright expired text strait into an article. The dos and don't are explained in the guideline WP:PLAGIARISM).
 
So when I expanded the Francis Windebank article it included the line """"Two others (daughters) became nuns of the Calvary at the Marais du Temple, Paris"""". Marais du Temple was a red-link, so I went on line and discovered that there was little in English on it but there was a French Wikipedia article so I copied and translated the lead from the French article and created Temple du Marais as a stub, unfortunately it still does not have citations, but from the pictures it clearly exists so it has not been put up for deletion. But in creating that article another red link was created Michel Villedo. So I created a stub for that. In that case it was much easier to source because there are reliable English language sources for the man.

So as you can see, one can use an article like minor campaigns of 1815 which has the potential to spark a whole level of creativity with missing biographies. It was your edit to the article that prompted me to look up detail on Charles Auguste Creutzer, and as I found enough I created the stub Charles Auguste Creutzer. But that still leave open the question """"how do you know that Siborne was referring to Charles Auguste Creutzer when he wrote General Kreutzer and not some other General Kreutzer? What is your source for saying he was the commandant of the Fortress of Bitsch?"""". As soon as a source can be found that say that we can modify the text or create an redirect

As to where to put your findings. Do you have a tab next to talk called [Sandbox] if so it should link to  I have about a score, including 3 sandboxes of which the contents of  and a  may interest you, as yet you  have none.

 Although Alexa Brown meets the minimum requirements for a separate article, I believe that WP:N's lead is relevant here: """"Editors may use their discretion to merge or group two or more related topics into a single article"""" is highly relevant.  Creating separate pages for these tightly related subjects both causes editorial hassles (trying to keep the two pages in sync and needing to decide whether a piece of information belongs on one page or the other) and reduces the likelihood that a reader will get the whole story (because most people will only read one of them).  Also, keeping it all here may reduce the temptation to use the biography for (self-)promotion of the politically active parents and/or their organization.

 Question about maltose binding protein article 

Hi Victor,

Just now I'm solving this problem with respect to this maltose binding protein tag, I found this article on wiki. And here is what you wrote:

""""...Once the fusion protein is obtained in purified form the protein of interest (X) is often cleaved from MBP with a specific protease. Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again.""""

It would be great if you can explain how can """"Protein X can then be separated from MBP by passing through the amylose column again"""" because I have tried it and it doesn't work. My personal guess is since MBP binds to maltose, it simply doesn't bind to amylose resins / column unless maltose is removed beforehand.

Then the question is how to remove maltose from MBP. From Davidson et al. Mechanism of maltose transport in Escherichia coli: Transmembrane signaling by periplasmic binding proteins (1992:

""""Preparation of Maltose-Free MBP

MBP was purified by affinity chromatography and was dialyzed extensively under conditions calculated to remove most of the bound maltose. For some experiments, MBP was denatured in 6M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and either dialyzed against 6M Gdn-HCl or passed through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 6M Gdn-HCl before renaturation by dialysis against 10mM KP1 (pH 7.0). UV-difference spectroscopy showed that the bulk of the MBP was free of maltose.""""

Hope to hear from you soon.

There are lots of definitions of terrorism but none of them are """"accepted"""". Every definition is disputed by somebody. That is the reason many news agencies don't label any attacks as terrorist attacks and nor should we. Investigating and adjudicating as to whether a particular incident falls within the US State Department definition of terrorism (for instance) when the State Department itself has not given it's opinion on the subject is most definitely Original research. Remember that an argument can be made that the Boston Tea party could qualify as a terrorist incident under some definitions. That is why I am suggesting we list all notable violent incidents and ongoing conflicts and let our readers decide whether they want to call a particular incident terrorism.

I'm ambivalent on this particular issue. On one hand, the content doesn't convey direct information on Muhammad and is therefore not essential to the article.

While Islamic law may prohibit Muslims from depicting Muhammad, non-Muslims shouldn't be pressed to follow Islamic customs. Naturality in the spirit of civility, even non-Muslims shouldn't engage in presenting works or content that denegrate Muslims or Islamic customs. This image however does not seem to be intended to denegrate Muhammad or Islam in any way, and therefore it's unreasonable for Muslims here to be so agitated by such images.

Time (magazine) shouldn't be fully capitalized
Please make sure every paragraph ends with at least one in-text citation
Her marriages should be in prose form rather than a numbered list
Friendship with Michael Jackson is trivial
Not sure if """"In 1971, Taylor became a grandmother at the age of 39"""" is necessary
The big quotes on her conversion to Judaism are simply overkill
For accolades, keep the focus on what she won; mere nominations that she lost aren't particularly noteworthy compared to actual wins

Edit war

Some notes for those who fear the truth:
A book by fr. Gino Conti was wiped out for the second time.
Another censorship (fr. Pezzi dismissed by Comboni missionaries). Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc.
The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc).
The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says """"I acknowledge the Way"""" but these words are preceded by """"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me"""".
The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way.
Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005.
There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way.
""""Factoid"""" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967.
The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest """"We're Approved"""" Neocatechumenal propaganda.
Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a """"Neocatechumenal spin"""" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin.
Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for """"granting a period of two years"""", but Benedict XVI decisions about that """"widespread manner"""" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not.
""""Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one"""": this valuable sentence tries to """"explain"""" in Neocatechumenalspeak the """"decision of the Holy Father"""" to require homily only from deacons and priests.
On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary).
The """"NPOV"""" tag was the last resort of some Neocatechumenal people fearing the truth.
Please stop this ugly """"edit war"""". Wiping out documented sources won't change the facts.

Another good one is """"lack of collaboration"""" on my own user talk page.  My conclusion is that this bully team exist to attack IP editors on a fear and predjudice basis. This seems to be the usual psychology, on the Internet in forums and real life, unfortunately. People fear the newbie and the unknown, attacking to rid themselves the unknown.

 Proposed Edits to New 'Section 3.1' - Timeline, 1875-1925 

1885–1924: The origin of IBM
 Year  Gross Income (in $m)  Employees 1890   1895   1900   1905   1910   1915  4  1,672 1920  14  2,731 1925  13  3,698
 
The roots of IBM date back the the 1880s, decades before the development of electronic computers. The company was formed through a merger of three different companies: the Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. in the 1880s), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Corporation (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA)..  The merger was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint, and the new company was called the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) CorporationMartin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer a History of the Information Machine — Second Edition, Westview Press, pages 37–39 2004. CTR was incorporated on June 16 1911 in Endicott, New York, U.S.A.. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.

The companies that merged to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and most importantly for the development of the computer, punched card equipment. The product lines were very different, but Flint believed that since they all focused on equipment that made businesses more efficient, there were synergies and cross selling opportunities to be had.  Based in New York City, the new company had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.

Of the companies merged to form CTR, the most technologically significant was the Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punch cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input. officemuseum.com – early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment

The Tabulating Machine Company originally sold some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project with amazing speed, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. But creating markets for the new technology was a struggle, and by 1911 Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health, was looking to rest on his laurels. He sold the business to  Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then created C-T-R. Hollerith remained involved with C-T-R for some years as a consultant, but his involvement waned as time went on.

When the diversified businesses of C-T-R proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.. Watson became General Manager of C-T-R in 1914 and President in 1915. I Drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their",0

 Definition of witchcraft/Wicca 

I have some problems with this section. It's all very nice to be able to laugh and say """"you're wrong on all these points"""", but in fact this section is misrepresenting Wicca just as much as the Harry-haters.
The heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and Wicca are synonymous. Wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft.
Wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. At Halloween (or Samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. Extensive spirit contact by Wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in A Voice in the Forest by Jimahl diFiosa, an Alexandrian High Priest.
Sorcery: well, Wiccans definitely perform magic. The word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with Wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly.
Occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? Well, Wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. And yes, Wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs.
Curses are of course forbidden in Wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic.
Demon posession: Whoever accused Wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. Wiccans practice what could loosely be called """"posession"""": calling our God or Goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. I guess this is fairly similar to what Christians call """"being filled with the spirit"""", but if you happen to consider the Wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than Jehovah is a demon), then you could term this """"demon possession"""", feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.

The real reason why Harry Potter has nothing to do with Wicca is because Harry Potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be Wicca or any other variety. How many kids watch the Power Rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? The Texas Rangers, just like the Power Rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. The parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.

I don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. Lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think Christians want it to be! ★ """,0

Appreciate the question, however I am not qualified to answer it. I live in Michigan, but do spend the winters in the Myrtle Beach area. I have been doing this (off and on ) for over 20 years. I often go to Atalaya Castle and Brookgreen Gardens - but basically for the enjoyment and taking pictures. I know little of the history of these places, other than what is in the brochures given out by the state. All the pictures at Brookgreen Gardens is mine - including at the bottom a slide show presentation of additional pictures. All the pictures at Commons are also mine. All the pictures at Atalaya Castle are also mine, except for the B & W one. Also recently I added a slide show presentation at the bottom of the group of pictures of additional pictures I took in 2006. Do these slide show presentations work for you? I have checked them on various computers at various locations and they appear to work properly (especially of the high speed connections). Sorry I couldn't help more. I think probably your best bet is others that edit these articles, especially the ones that started them (if they are still around). There is an article on Huntington Beach State Park which I have edited, however basically from a formating """"clean up"""" standpoint (removing peacock terms). Notice they are requesting additional photos of HBSP, so will have to go take some and enter into the article. Maybe even make a slide show. What do you think of this idea of a """"slide show"""" of pictures? Should they be narrated or is classical music alright? How about amateur home movies of places like this? BTY, Atalya Castle is directly across Highway 17 from Brookgreen Gardens. Brookgreen Gardens is about a mile directly inland. In the slide show of Atalaya the first slide shows the original road going directly from the residence of Atalaya Castle to Brookgreen Gardens as the Huntingtons would have used it in the 1930's to move the large sculptures.

Comment about JJ Bulten

Greetings,

I would like to mention that I added 0% of the """"OR"""" tags and thus am innocent. I realize that when someone is trying to find a compromise, it is easier to blame """"both sides"""" for a conflict. However, on closer inspection, I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wiki-policies and outside sources, while JJB is using scorched-Earth tactics. Please consider this example:

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move, for compliance's sake, in some other polite way. First, the """"vote"""" remains 6-4 by my count: no consensus. Second, your unsourced statement of thousands of """"longevity myths"""" cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors; see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs. 91. Third, this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of """"myth"""" mirrors stem from Ryoung's wholly unsourced 2005 insertions. (The User:Shii/Hoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing. See User talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity, ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions.)

            Yet another FALSE accusation. There is no """"hoaxing"""" here at all, nor has there been any attempt at """"hoaxing."""" I am not responsible for third-party sites, but if they choose to copy my work, might it be because they consider it a reliable source?Ryoung122 

                Comment: Looking closer, we see that it was JJB that listed this as a """"hoax"""":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity.2C_ticklish_situation

Citation of one's own accusation is a circular argument, and thus invalid.

In other words, JJBulten first adds material to Shi's page then cites his own add as """"proof"""" of hoaxing. Actually, it's only proof of his fanaticism, of hitting 'below the belt' in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image. """,0

Look, this is all very simple.  Not once have the child molestation allegations been presented on wikipedia as anything other than an investigation that, to everyone's knowledge, has not led to formal charges.  If you, or anyone else, want to edit the page to elaborate on the matter, saying, """"Due to the fact that no evidence can be found that the investigations of Mr. Fitch resulted in formal charges, the veracity of the allegations is very much called into question."""", then guess what?  THAT'S FINE!  That's both factual and quite possibly the most accurate portrayal of the truth, to everyone's knowledge, I would assume.

But you know what else is factual?  That SABC claimed that he was a child molester.  If SABC lied about that, don't you think people ought to know so the status of the case against him?  That no formal charges have been brought against him?  And not only to possibly vindicate Mr. Fitch in the eyes of those who would have normally assumed that he was guilty, but also to possibly diminish the reputation of SABC for accusing him of such a serious crime?

I really don't see any way to justify the removal of the material, however.  To my knowledge, it doesn't become libel until you claim or suggest that SABC was correct.  I also cannot imagine why anyone would not agree to the middle-ground approach, which is to add the """"no formal charges"""" comment in order to balance the material.   """,0

 Metacompiler 

Hay I see you contributed to compiler-compiler and to the metacompiler page adding a CWIC topic

It seams that the originator of the metacompiler topic intended it to include forth or at least is using the forth idea of a metacompiler saying that because it compiles it's self I.E.

Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

A common saying on FORTH sites. Especially """"meta step"""" The fact is that LISP compiles it's self practically the same identical way as Forth does.

Self-hosting compilers are common. Most general purpose language compilers are self-hosted. I pointed out that many of the compilers I wrote or worked on, compiled themselves. And actually the initial development steps of self hosting compilers are the same as described. I was head of the Language Development Group at Kontron electronics. Many console games were written using our compilers. All of the compilers were written in an extended PASCAL. Which bootstrapped from scratch. Most were cross compilers for processors our In Circuit Emulators supported. Actually I started with FutureData that was bought be GenRad and then sold to Kontron.

A self-hosting metacompiler is a lot easier to bootstrap up then a general purpose language.
 
Historically metacompilers were compiler compilers. Compiler compiler was the general term used in the 60's Then yacc yuked that up being a parser generator. And calling it's self Yet Another Compiler Compiler. Compared to the compiler compilers of 60's yacc is only hacc. Half a compiler compiler. My term was Half Ass Compiler Compiler. There are implementation of yacc that use yacc to compile it's self. So metacompiler (old version) hasn't really separates it's self from other compiler compilers. Sense the start of this despute I have added referanced defination of metacompilers. The [Sci-Tech Dictionary McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 6th edition, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. http://www.answers.com/topic/metacompiler] clearly states """" A metacompilers is a compiler that is used chiefly to construct compilers for other programming languages.""""

We have gotten into a flame war on the metacompiler talk page over the defining feature:

""""The feature that sets a metacompiler apart from a standard compiler-compiler is that a metacompiler is written in its own language and translates itself."""" 
Defining itself and translating itself this way constitutes the meta-step that sets a metacompiler apart from other compiler-compilers

It's true that a metacompiler usually defines it's self. But not all metacompiler were self-hosted for various reasons. Damon really went ballistic when I found a metacompiler written in PL/1 in a reference he gave to prove his position. Going on about me misconstruing his I do not know what.

The subjects of compiler-compiler, syntax-directed-compiler, and metacompiler are all closely related. And at one time were the same thing. The distinguishing factors are needed if they are really separate subjects.

There have been many metacompiler over the years that are called metacompilers. Some like BOOK1, BOOK2, and CWIC are meta compilers An early metacompiler that did not call it's self a meta compiler was:

""""A compiler-building system developed by Brooker and Morris"""" Brooker and Morris, Communications of the ACM Volume 7 Issue 7, July 1964 It has a parsing language """"BNF"""" and a machine description language """"MDL"""" There is an intermediate """"GSL"""" generation Strategy L:anguage.

CWIC was based partly on Schorre's META compilers and partly on LISP2 developed at SDC The syntax language includes features from TREE META. Is unclear of Schorre worked on TREE META. Thhe Stanford Research paper does not list Schorre. 

I implemented an extended CWIC compiler compiler on a DEC-System-10 between 1969 and 72. I added a machine description language and created a pseudo operation language (macro like functions using most of the CWIC generator production language). I am very familiar with how CWIC worked. I have taken to using TREE META terminology using unparse rules instead of pattern matching as used in CWIC documentation. The rules are actually recursive EVAL(ADD[EVAL(X),EVAL(Y)])=> has EVAL calling it's self on the tree legs and returning local variables in X and Y. That is a feature of tree meta also except tree meta doesn't have local variables.

I started an RFC and probably did it wrong as there has been no comments other then our bickering.

Val Schorre submitted papers in the SegForth ACM group in the 80s. Val said forth is not a meta compiler on his web site (now gone so can't be referanced).

"There are 3 articles.  Contract Bridge, Rubber bridge and Duplicate bridge.  It is possible there are more and that I've missed something.  One article is the parent article, it should include some history of how the game developed from Whist and that article would be Contract Bridge.  That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.  But I don't believe it would be appropriate to do more than touch on bidding systems.  Rubber bridge is the way Contract Bridge is scored.  Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.  But I would very much like to see these articles be friendly and readable so that a person who had never played bridge could read them and could find a logical development of complexity and of expertise required.  So that a green player could view both how to begin to learn to play and where the top is too, that people make their living at playing bridge, that there are international tournements of great interest, that some top bridge players are recognized by various public figures and so on.  So that a person can follow the logical development of being a beginning player, right through to becoming a top player.  And the joy of the intellectual compitition combied with the social intercourse of sitting at a table with 3 people.  We could compare that, perhaps, to Chess which is likewise an intellectual compitition but is less social with each board lasting longer and being less casual.  You know what I mean?

1. Simply put, it's a good idea to centralize information. Somebody who's reading minor houses and wants to read about Roose and Ramsey will find it easier and more intuitive to go to a House Bolton entry than a minor characters entry.

Possible Original Research:
I only skimmed through on these parts, but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited - either for verification, or simply for the sake of further reading.

1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The """"Hexagon"""") because of the geometric shape of its territory.

Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.

2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.

Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of """"Frank"""" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.

However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means """"Realm of the Franks"""". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Now here we're talking about cite-cite-cite-for-crying-out-loud-cite! Some of this might not only be original research, but speculation, also! Two Wikipedia-no-nos riddled into one!

Image copyright problem RE: Image:Zeorin.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Zeorin.jpg. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law. We need you to specify two things on the image description page:
 The copyright holder, and
 The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using image copyright tags. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.  

There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:
An open content licence
Public Domain
Fair Use

The copyright holder gets the best protection of their work by licencing it under an open content license such as the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence. If you have the express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence, use the image copyright tag: . The GNU Free Documentation License is another option. Again, if you have the express permission of the copyright holder, use the tag .

The copyright holder can also release their work into the public domain. See here for examples.

Images from certain sources are automatically released into the public domain. This is true for the United States, where the Wikimedia servers are located. (See here  for images from the government of the USA and here for other governments.)  However, not all governments release their work into the public domain. One exception is the UK (see here for images from the UK government). Non-free licence governments are listed here. 

Also, in some cases, an image is copyrighted but allowed on Wikipedia because of fair use. To see a) if this image qualifies, and b) if so, how to tag it, see Wikipedia:Fair use.  

For more information, see Wikipedia:Image copyright tags. Please remember that untagged images are likely to be deleted.

If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them. Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.

If you have any questions, just leave a message on my talk page. Thanks again.  """,0

"Cetainly there seems to be a few 'sins of omission' from this post.  I have no particular axe to grind with the ACLU, but on reading some of the comments on this discussion page I noticed one that said the founder was a Communist.  Clearly this is important information, as the ACLU was formed at a time when Communism was considered the pinnacle of anti-patriotism in America.  It certainly coloured my view of the organisation, and I feel it would help to bring an insight into its formation.  Yet this is not mentioned in the article.  Surely this is pertinent, given the progressive, almost anarchic, political leanings of the organisation past and present?  I have to say, from a neutral's point of view (I'm from the UK, so the ACLU does not affect me one way or the other), I'm beginning to feel that this is not a neutral article.

 I don't get it. 

So if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect?

But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.

With that in mind  does the principle boil down to """"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible""""?

The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was """"in use"""" already, what does he consist of?

Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.

I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that """"matters"""" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.

I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.

The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that """"already"""" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no """"other"""" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).

All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. —  (talk · contribs) """,0

"""Student essay editing...==
Andy, if you are so keen, then you are encouraged to make the improvements.  These contributions are inferior in many ways as is being widely discussed not only by myself but others.  The rest of us have day jobs, so limited time to contribute.  As you probably know from your teaching experiences, repairing student essays take hours of effort and time.  Sincerely said, I just dont think that these unsupervised contributions from students are of the technical or stylistic standards we are accustomed to in Wikipedia.  The graphics are copyright violations, the article are often violate WP:NOTTEXTBOOK and are preachy or making value judgements.  The referencing ignores WP:SECONDARY.  If you find these massive additions, salvageable, then you can join the completely absent instructor in editing.  We really hope that you can help with content!    
I find your mass removal of good faith contributions by new editors, and your repeatedly pejorative descriptions of them, both outwith the spirit of Wikipedia (WP:BITE, WP:AGF), and disruptive (WP:POINT). If you are too busy to make fixes, that's OK, you are not personally required to do so - just leave the material for others to fix.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
As I have already indicated, at that stage in my traiing would have submitted similarly awful essays. So my pejorative comments are directed at the so-called ambassadors-coordinators-instructors who foster and protect such inappropriate and poorly crafted content.  Like you, they are waiting and praying for someone with writing skills to intervene.  But as you're discovering, determined mediocrity can be difficult to rectify within the fringes of Wikipedia.  Looking forward to your help with editing these and other articles.   
Those people may have been your intended targets, but that's quite clearly not the result you achieved; here as elsewhere. And no, I do not pray.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits

WP:Redlink says (in the 3rd paragraph) that Articles should not have red links to topics that are not likely to have an article, so I think the question we should consider is whether all these students are notable enough to have their own articles in the foreseeable future. The fact that someone studied under Heisenberg is not sufficient for notability, unless he/she discovered something important either during their doctorate or later. My preference would be to remove 7 of these 8 red links until some editor explains (perhaps on the talk page) why each student is notable. The only one I would retain is Şerban Ţiţeica, because the infobox shows that we do have articles on him in 3 other languages which can be translated.",0

Notability of Binaria (Collective)
 A tag has been placed on Binaria (Collective) requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    (Talk to the Hand|Contribs) """,0

"""Hip-Hop Is NOT Dead But Ready To """"Get It""""!!! (Calif) Hip-hop producer and west coast native E. Re-ill debuts his album “Get It”. “Get It” is the representation of E. Re-ill's mindset, """"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled """"The War"""". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video """"Straight Outta Compton"""" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like """"Dark People"""" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. """"I'm So Gangsta"""" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar's look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don't cheat yourself I'm so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled """"Jack London’s Square"""". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties.

I have tried doing EBSCO host searches and have looked for titles in my university library (the largest library in my state, mind you), and I have been unable to find a single title that is exclusively about Hillsdale College.

Then, after the partion, which created nations, there suddenly was a militancy problem. Same exact scenario in Israel.

I see that you mean the Lesbianism in erotica article. But, like I told Drmies, I don't know much about lesbianism in erotica. I know more about research on lesbian sexual identity, lesbian sexual activities, and human sexuality in general.

"""= Traffic drives improvement ===

The outlines aren't complete, but they are complete enough to be useful to readers.  And what good is a table of contents hidden in the back?  Tables of contents are most useful in the front.

The hatnote issue is very similar to adding the """"Contents"""" link to the sidebar.  And you opposed that too, on the grounds that the system wasn't ready to be displayed.

Shenme captured the essence of the situation very well:

A 'normal' wiki usually doesn't have a core structure, and so people don't expect it, but Wikipedia has quite a lot of material, and various ways of organizing it.  Having a link in the sidebar to the contents page will help people to discover what organization there is.  (whether perfect or not a separate topic).  And, actually, pointing people to the contents page and getting their resulting comments will improve the page.  Don't wait for the improvements first...  

The OOK needs editors for each of its pages, and for the essential pages it's missing.  Relying on a small team to finish all of this will take decades. (Do the math).  I've been on this project for almost 4 years already!

So, if hatnotes will benefit readers while attracting editors to these pages, then that looks like a pretty damn good solution to me.

This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).

 Gyroscopic Inertial Thrusters 

Interesting discussion. The greatest hindrance to discovery and invention is MENTAL INERTIA, and the treatment of science as though it is a dogmatic religion.
 
Can anyone cite an authority that made the ridiculous statement that angular accelerations and momentum can NOT be exchanged for linear accelerations and momentum?
 
Such claims were made by Edison, attempting to discredit Tesla's alternating current. Mass and momentum equations are remarkably similar to the math involving electronics.
 
Over 20 others repeated my experiments, converting angular accelerations into linear acceleration, passing pendulum, water, ice skid, and air table tests.
 
Conservation of energy is NOT violated, since energy is required to change the velocity or direction of the device.  While only small """"anomalous"""" amounts of thrust have been generated, the venemous nature of religion in the name of science has been VERY difficult to overcome.
 
""""Do NOT confuse me with facts and experiments that appear to violate a BASIC TENNANT of physics, it is IMPOSSIBLE, therefore I will disbelieve my lying eyes!"""" - is the too common reaction when any attempt is made to further this field of research.  This is inconvenient, and NOT helpful, especially when fanatics insist on erasing any facts that do not conform to their religious views of science.

"The distinction I would draw is whether the content is published and accepted.  Wikipedia:No original research#What_is_excluded.3F gives a list of seven criteria for determining whether or not something is original research ... but really what it boils down to is whether or not you can find other secondary sources making the same claim.  I had never heard of this tomb before this evening so obviously I don't know enough about it to say what is and is not accepted science in this respect.  ;)  From what you are saying, it sounds like there are two questions - (1) is it appropriate to discuss the symbolism findings in the article and (2) if so, is it appropriate to cite your work.  In the case of the former, it depends on whether or not this has become an accepted finding.  Is it still a theory or has it gained acceptance?  Have other authors picked up on it and do they cite it as accepted truth or as a new theory?  The primary reason for the original research policy is that there are constantly new theories coming out about everything - Jimbo (the founder of Wikipedia) originally mentioned physics, but I think it applies to any field.  Some theories are good for a term paper or thesis and never see the light of day again.  Others become accepted truth over time.  Wikipedia is not the place for giving a sounding board to new ideas and theories - we wait until they are accepted.  The second question is whether, if this content is to be included, it would be appropriate to cite your book.  I believe, as I said before, that you (personally) should not add it, but should let someone else do it - that's just basic journalistic integrity - we as individual editors don't promote our own stuff.  Blogs are almost never considered appropriate ... so I really don't think having a link to your blog would be a good idea.  Sources on Wikipedia should be peer-reviewed journals, newspapers, etc, where more than one person is responsible for the content.  Blogs are generally a bad thing.  I hope all this helps ...

"""

This is getting really tiresome. As I have already said many times before, no, it is frankly NOT TRUE that """"If you dedicated the amount of time to articles that you do to sniping at other editors, and based on the knowledge you claim to have, there would be some greatly improved articles."""". I estimate it would take at least 20 hours to write an article on a large operator like London Northern, using all the proper issue numbers and ISBN numbers. By contrast, I've expended at most 2 hours criticising the actions of all the people who wish to see articles like NIBS and Nu-Venture deleted because they personally don't know anything about the companies, and don't know where to look for the issue numbers/ISBN numbers. In that light, instead of whining and bitching to me, why don't you demonstrate in some way that it would actually be worth my while doing anything for Wikipedia, where articles can be deleted on a whim by people like Dave, simply because they can't find any information about them in a 5 second Google search, and don't know where to look for sources in the print media. Do you want to tell me why I, or anyone else for that matter, should be putting in several hours work into Wikipedia to write articles, when all Dave has to do is type a few words to get the very same articles deleted, and nobody will spend even a second figuring out if he's in any position to be judging them at all?

"""I just read this article for the first time yesterday and I agree that the language in this article is not encyclopedic in tone. It made me laugh out loud in several places, and it's probably not supposed to. Even if the sources use this kind of language, it is not considered the best writing practices and can be vastly improved. For example,

 Why would Nelson's legitimate children be singled out in a box? Why in the section titled """"Children"""", would the ones sired out of wedlock not be included, as in the one he had with Georgeanne Crewe? Why actually have an entire section on his children? Why not just a paragraph? Or actually, they are mentioned in other places, so why the entire section to emphasize them? 
 Why is Kris Nelson described as """"making love"""" with Ron Reagan, but Nelson is described as """"cavorting"""" with two LA Rams cheerleaders in the same paragraph? These euphemisms need to be replaced by the simplest term: """"having sex"""".
 """"She was hell-bent on taking everything she possibly could and leaving Rick ruined."""" Good gracious, this needs a quote from a biographer or something: According to biographer John Q. Gossipmonger...
 I agree that too much is written about Nelson's volatile relationships. I don't see how it has any bearing on his career or notability in performing.
 Why is it necessary to know that Blair was a cocaine-user, shoplifter, and Nelson's family disapproved of their relationship? What bearing does this have on how readers should understand why he was notable? I'm not saying the details about his various affairs should be hidden, but the article makes it seem as if, perhaps like Hugh Hefner, Ricky Nelson was *as notable* for his affairs as he was the job that made him famous. Overlooking the article, the same amount of emphasis is placed on his music career as it is placed on his personal life. Actually, somewhat less. I get the impression a relative of Nelson's has had a hand in writing this article. Perhaps a progeny who was directly involved in some of the court cases among the Nelsons and Harmons. If, in fact, the best reliable sources assert that Nelson's affairs actually were as important as his performing career, a quote about that statement should come from a very good source. 

I wrote Roy Orbison's article, and I understand the issue above about sources writing about the """"juicy"""" parts of the subject's life. One of the biographies I used was rather determined to place undue and frankly odd emphasis on the writer's view that Orbison was a hapless underachiever who tripped into fame by accident, and the book is designed to paint him as a mediocre guy in extraordinary circumstances. Orbison's life was nowhere near as vibrantly sexual as Ricky Nelson's (an impression that is really backed up in this article), so the biographer slipped in shocking tidbits about other artists, for some reason explaining that only parts of Patsy Cline were found after her airplane accident. So what to do as a Wikipedia editor? Weed out that wtf? in the biography and stick only to the facts.

Thanks.  ayanosh

 From user Jshapely 

Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for your suggestions on the article I wrote on Alessandro Liberati. To address your concerns about his notability:

he is especially known as one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of over 28,000 volunteers in more than 100 countries formed to organize research information about health care interventions in a systematic way, to aid well informed health care decisions (see also the description available in Wikipedia about the Collaboration). To date, more than 5000 “systematic reviews” on specific topics have been published in the Cochrane Library. Due to its relevance, widely acknowledged by clinicians, health care researchers and policymakers, the Cochrane Collaboration has a seat on the World Health Assembly to provide inputs on resolutions of the World Health Organization. The founder role of Liberati has been acknowledged by Sir Iain Chalmers Chalmers I. Alessandro Liberati: a personal appreciation. Epidemiologia & Prevenzione 2012;36:3. Available at http://www.epiprev.it/attualit%C3%A0/alessandro-liberati-un-ricordo-personale, who is himself acknowledged as one of the founders of the Collaboration in 1993 (see his profile in Wikipedia). The Italian Cochrane Centre was one of the first to be established (in 1994). Other people have their profile on Wikipedia mainly because of their role in the Collaboration (aside from Iain Chalmers, see also Dave Sackett and Chris Silagy). The relevant role of Liberati in the Collaboration can be also better understood by reading the countless acknowledgements in the farewell page http://www.cochrane.org/features/farewell-professor-alessandro-liberati  and in the memory book http://www.cochrane.org/alessandro-memory-book posted on the Cochrane website.
As for his published work (one of the relevant features indicated in the Wikipedia notability guidelines for academics) he is author of more than 200 papers published in peer reviewed and indexed journals, as it can be easily verified in Pubmed or in Google Scholar; some of these papers represent highly cited academic work, especially on how to report results of meta analyses and systematic reviews. 
As for other characteristics which can be worth highlighting (also according to the Wikipedia guidelines), he was on editorial boards of prestigious and selective academic journals, such as the Annals of Internal Medicine (house organ of the American College of Physicians) and the British Medical Journal (of the British Medical Association).
Last but not the least, several obituary articles followed his death on specialized medical journals; among these, I would like to highlight the one on The Lancet Watts G. Alessandro Liberati. Lancet 2012;379:214 (which is, according to the Journal Citation Index, the second general medical journal for number of citations) and the one on the British Medical Journal Magrini N, Smith R. Alessandro Liberati. Campaigned for high quality evidence relevant to patients. BMJ 2012;344:e1101
All these things I tried to make explicit in my article, supporting them with several citations for verifiability (a few of which also available online). I understand your point that my article may appear as a tribute to a recently dead person. As for neutral point of view, I didn’t find testimonies contrary to the good reputation I reported for Liberati. To limit the “tribute feeling” that the article may transmit, I cut the last two paragraphs (on his work in Italy and on his networking role).

Hoping that this may help support the new submission, I send you my best regards  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
Jshapely, I do not think anyone has contested the notability of your subject, simply the general tone of the article.   Theoretically the Wikipedia should just report facts.   You may have looked at WP:NPOV.  Also related is WP:PEACOCK.   Let me look over your article this week end.   I have marked it as under review.   If I feel comfortable with the article, I will approve it for you.   If I am not so co",0

 Trolling by Novangelis 

It's not good enough for those who hold to the scientific standards invented by Christians (not atheists such as yourself) Novagelis, the known troll, who stalks those who rebuke him on Yahoo Answers. How arrogant of you and anti-scientific of you to think that whatever is good for you is good for everyone else. How careless of truth you are with that attitude.

That an association that tends to Jacob's Sheep calls them primitive (and I'm really sure you've counted everyone who says they are) is not scientific evidence that they are primitive. You display your poor understanding of what science is and your childish attitude of tit for tat by finding arbitrary reference to back up whatever you say rather than scientific evidence. If you can repeat an experiment that shows Jacob's Sheep let alone any other kind of animals are """"primitive"""" to other sheep and in what way they are """"primitive"""", go ahead and do so. Stop trolling, stop vandalizing, stop spreading propaganda, stop seeking revenge merely because you were exposed repeatedly as trolling on Yahoo Answers and Wikipedia. And stop being anti-scientific. !""",0

To determine the best way to test for a feature, refer to the documentation for the feature of interest. The following list discusses some common techniques for feature detection:
You can test for the presence of the functions associated with a feature. To test for the presence of a function in a system DLL, call the LoadLibrary function to load the DLL. Then call the GetProcAddress function to determine whether the function of interest is present in the DLL. Use the pointer returned by GetProcAddress to call the function. Note that even if the function is present, it may be a stub that just returns an error code such as ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
You can determine the presence of some features by using the GetSystemMetrics function. For example, you can detect multiple display monitors by calling GetSystemMetrics(SM_CMONITORS).
There are several versions of the redistributable DLLs that implement shell and common control features. For information about determining which versions are present on the system your application is running on, see the topic Shell and Common Controls Versions.
If you must require a particular operating system, be sure to use it as a minimum supported version, rather than design the test for the one operating system. This way, your detection code will continue to work on future versions of Windows.",0

Events don't need titles?
There is a common pratice by American television to label events as if it were a television programme.

The Hebrew name for Hebrew, """"Ivrit"""", is derived from """"Ivrim"""" (the Hebrew word for """"Israelites"""") meaning simply """"the language of the Israelites"""". Neither word means """"side"""". However, both of these words are constructed from the root consonants ע (/ʕ/,), ב (/v/) and ר (/r/).

 No, I do think that Wikipedia should mention this effort on Buckley's part and have not said otherwise. Absolutely. Buckley's attempt to read Rand out spanned his whole career, N.R. articles through the 1960s, the """"RIP"""" at her death, and straight up to his book Getting It Right. It's not only important to Buckley's own history but to the history of the American Intellectual Right. Rand's friends and students influenced important people on the Goldwater campaign, in the Reagan Administration, and in the media, such as Limbaugh, Beck, Stossel, Napolitano, Neal Boortz, etc., who have all cited her repeatedly, recently and favorably, recommending the very book that the Buckley/Chambers's review was all about. No, Rand was not a """"conservative"""" and my admiration of Rand, though contextual, includes respect for the fact that she never called herself a """"conservative"""" and never would have wanted to be part of such a movement. She doesn't get to decide these things any more than Buckley does, however, and it is Rand's actual, important and on-going influence among self-described conservatives that determines this. Limbaugh, for example, has extensively quoted from Atlas Shrugged on his air  without qualification  and more than once. Even Sean Hannity on his Fox program has favorably mentioned the new Atlas Shrugged movie.

I'm sure you might already know that Wikipedia has a bad reputation when it comes to objectively reporting health information that conflicts with so-called mainstream approaches.  One full-time industry plant who was monitoring/editing Wikipedia articles (like this one) has already been exposed.

 Re: Tracker (business software) 

Hello, thanks for your comments on my talk page.  You mention that the article was """"already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia"""".  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job.  I read through the AFD, the DRV, and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on.  AFD/DRV were able to determine the notability of the article, but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in it's past state the article wasn't much more than a product sheet, which to me is synonymous with advertising.  Wikipedia articles aren't about features lists or product offerings, they are about bringing together neutral, third-party-verified information about topics.  As I'm sure you've seen I rearranged the page a little more since.  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names & descriptions, so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia.  (Also, this is minor, but Wikipedia admins are no different in terms of article approval than any other editor. I am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).

You are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.  The article is very well sourced, but not very much of that information is brought into the article.

As for the List of project management software, with such a relatively short list, it is inappropiate to have several links to the same family of products.  I don't know a way would satisfy your concern, other than to suggest to put the link in the best place you see fit. In the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.  Again, please remember the primary focus of Wikipedia (see What Wikipedia is not), which is to bring neutral information, not advertising or promoting.    """,0

"Philatelic categorization 

Hello.  Can you please bear with me re the categories as I have a massive amount of data to input.  Unfortunately, I do not have very much time to spend on the project and all my data has to be reformatted to meet Wikipedia’s tagging standard.

I have amended the categories because they lacked structure and there is need for a systematic approach.  A friend, who is a postal expert but only an occasional computer user, told me he was going round in circles trying to tie up relevant articles.  I am an IT professional and even I struggled to make any sense of the category structure.  

There should be a single root category and in this case philately is the obvious choice since that is the umbrella term for the entire pursuit.  Philately itself is a hobby or pastime or subject or whatever so it is entirely reasonable that it should also be a sub-category of those wider categories.  I found that philately had such as postage stamps, postal markings and postal history as sub-categories but philately was also a sub-category of each of those, which is nonsense and does not help new users.  Equally, similar articles such as the postage stamps of a particular country were categorised across the board instead of being allocated to a single category within a hierarchical or relative structure which non-IT people like my friend can easily navigate.

After I made a few amendments to the philatelic/postal categories, I asked my friend to try again and he found what he was looking for immediately.  This is the benefit of a structured, systematic approach.

Whereas philately is the root, it splits into two main sub-categories.  One of these is philately ‘’per se’’ which could be defined as the study of the physical aspects of stamps (e.g., watermarks, types of paper, gums, etc.).  The other aspect is the actual issue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is all done at the behest of a postal authority (on the chicken before egg principle).  Anything to do with issuing stamps and organising collection, sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub-category along with “physical” philately.  The term “postal authority” is a catchall for any organisation that has issued stamps and processed mail: national government, army of occupation, foreign postal agency, etc.

Having said all that, I agree that it is a good idea to categorise types of stamp independently of a country’s issues and, on that basis, “postage stamps” should be a sub-category of “philately”.  There is a clear difference between the two disciplines.  I will endeavour to make use of that difference, especially as our inputs will fall into both of those categories.

As I say, please bear with us as we have a massive input to make and it will take some time to accomplish.",0

"Selena removed - here's why 

I see that Selena was on this list as having a stamp issued in 2006. I have removed her due to the fact that there were stamps, but they weren't issued by the USPS. The Selena stamps were issued by a company called Premier Postage. Their site claims to produce stamps using themes that are licensed by various folks that can be used as postage (the site also claims the USPS has authorized this). In Selena's case it appears her estate licensed her image to this company and they produced stamps. While these stamps may be valid for US postage, I feel she doesn't qualify for this list due to the stamps being issued by a private firm and not by the USPS. For more on this, See: News from PremierPostage, Selena  Coming to a Mailbox Near You, Selena to be featured on a postage stamp. - Thanks, ''''hie",0

 Some suggest edits for grammar 

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was 10th President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949–1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959–1965). He was Senate President in 1963. He claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Maharlika in northern Luzon during the Second World War, something much doubted however to be true.[1][2] As Philippine president and strongman, his greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure development and international diplomacy. However, his administration was marred by massive authoritarian corruption, despotism, nepotism, political repression, and human rights violations. He benefited from a large personality cult in the Philippines during his regime.[3] In 1983, his government was implicated in the assassination of his primary political opponent, Benigno Aquino, Jr.. The implication caused a chain of events, including a tainted presidential election that served as the catalyst for the People Power Revolution in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later alleged that he and his wife Imelda Marcos had moved billions of dollars of embezzled public funds to the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into alleged corporations during his 20 years in power.

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte outside Laoag City to parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. He was named after Ferdinand VII of Spain and baptized into the Philippine Independent Church. According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally Taguktok, and their Ilokano roots have some Japanese and Chinese ancestry. Ferdinand was a champion debater at the University of the Philippines, where he also participated in boxing, swimming and wrestling.

In December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of Julio Nalundasan. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail [4] and in the fall[when?] of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.[5]

In 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated cum laude with a law degree from the U.P. College of Law. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated magna cum laude. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu international honor society. While in detention, Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. of Ilocos Norte helped Marcos study for the bar exams by providing a desk lamp in his cell, law books and reviewers. Marcos passed the bar examination with an almost perfect score of 98.01%, while also writing an 830-page defense. Several people contested his score and a retake was taken albeit an oral bar examination witnessed by several people. His second bar examination resulted in a 100% score, the highest grade obtained in the Philippine Bar).[6]

Marcos became senator after serving as member of the House of Representatives for three terms. In the Senate he served as minority floor leader before gaining the Senate presidency. He established a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the republic's statute books.[7]
[edit] Personal life

He was married to Imelda Romualdez-Marcos, with four children: Maria Imelda """"Imee"""" Marcos, Ferdinand """"Bongbong"""" Marcos, Jr., Irene Marcos, and Aimee Marcos, who was adopted.

[edit] Administration and Cabinet

The cabinet appointments of President Marcos can be divided into three periods: his first two constitutional terms (1965–1973), the New Society appointments from 1973–1978, and the change from departments to ministries from 1978 to the end of his government.

"DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.
The idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.
Why dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet! So far as I concerned the truth is in the Holy Bible, some truth is also in the Quran.
There are some truths to be found also in other religious books, but the whole truth is Christ and the books of OT and NT are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Have a read of Revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from GOD! 

Enough of this rubbish about Christian inventions of spirits. Pagans invented their gods, and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.

Jews and Christians had the opposite, GOD revealed to them the TRUTH and THE WAY, AND THE LIFE.

I’m not disagreeing the fact that Hulk Hogan, let alone anyone, having a belt hanging up on their walls. I believe all the wrestlers have at least a replica of some sorts of all the titles they ever won. I remember seeing John Cena’s, Trish Stratus’s, and Chyna’s homes with a title belt hanging in their respective walls. I also recall Mick Foley mentioning that he has an “Attitude” version of the old WWF title in his closet. In the case with Hogan, he might actually have the real WCW title in his possession. He is only the greatest “Sports Entertainer” ever. I do mean ever!! However, I’m talking about the title, not the belt. I know that “possession is 9/10 of the law"""", but in this case, having the physical belt doesn’t make you a champion. Think about Rhyno and the older version of the ECW title. He has the belt, but Lashley is the Current Champion.  15:56""",0

(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games """"SHALL NOT"""" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither """"contained"""" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  

For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.

So, I have added Sultan Kudarat in favor of José María of Manila, since is he the only Philippine national hero from the Moro region. Additionally I have also added Said Basher albeit he is a national Islamic imam, in to accompany the existing Roman Catholic priests (San Pedro Calungsod and Francisca del Espíritu Santo Fuentes).

"I am sure that clarity would help; if only we could agree as to what one would say. The knub of the disagreement comes in the relationship between Acts and the letters. Long arguments have already taken place between those who, supported by scholars such as Conzelman, think Acts to have a comparatively low historical value, emphasising the hostility towards Judaism expressed in Galatians, and those who regard Scripture as consistent de fide so that any one statement must be reconcilable with any other. Critical scholarship makes the second view difficult to hold, though it is represented in the article. the statement about St. Paul's prctice would be controverted on precisely these grounds by a number of editors and, more important, by scholars. It is always hard for editors to cope with the fact that we are not, as a matter of WP policy in a position to say that anything is 'indefensible. That is POV - a point of view. We can say that this learned person or that has argued in this way or that. Whne I last looked at the article it nowhere suggested that St. Paul was a Judaizer; quite the contary as Peter Ballard writes. 

In short, I fear that one person's clarity may be someone else's POV. Because we have no credibility of ourselves, we must cite someone else, someone who has some scholarly credibility.",0

 How about an RFC then? 

Can we try an RFC?  I'd like to start with a brief neutral statement of the question and have others here respond with one statement each, link prior discussions if you like, limited to 1000 words, no rebuttals or arguments, then wait for comments from others, at least two days before any reactions.  The neutral question would be """"Should the title of this article be Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, or Serbia under German Occupation, or something else; consider the prior talk sections above.""""  I will not be making a statement myself, but I may respond after two days, or sooner if others decide not to respect the proposal.  OK?    
No. An RFC while there's an RM going on? Just list the RM on various noticeboards. And an RfC for what exactly? If someone wants to move the article - let him post an RM, that's what its for. We'd probably go through the whole annoying song and dance to no effect. And where's the sense in having an RM for a move to one title, while posting an RfC (of all things) for a move to another title??

I'm sure Antidiskriminator & Co. will jump at this, since for them whatever you (their perceived new-found ally )) propose and I oppose must be a good thing. But it makes no sense. I certainly won't accept any title that has not been agreed-upon in a proper RM, whatever the outcome of the RfC - indeed, if any. Additionally, an RfC may not be the most useful and effective means of DR here, since the dispute is immensely complex, obscure, and thoroughly bogged-down in misleading rhetorical nonsense.

I always stick to the facts. Forget the Magyarisation terms. and now a little summary of your claim (try to concentrate):  There was full education in language X (like in Slovakia, Romania, Serbia, Croatia) and the government saw that (and this is your claim and is not true, because the same would apply to the neighbouring countires) the minorities start to lose their language. As a result it decided to restrict education in language X (you say to a few subjects, I say de-facto to 2 hours a week - but it does not matter), because there was """"no need"""" to teach some subjects in their language (which is a sociolinguistic non-sense). This is an illogical and actually chauvinist statement. What any normal government should do in such situation (wrongly claimed by you) is AT LEAST not restrict education in the language. Secondly, bilingual schools are no minority schools. Minority schools are only schools were the full language of education is the given language. Therefore the minority schools were literally shut down. This holds by definition and cannot be subject to any exaggeration.

FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
Dr Philip Opas (defence lawyer for Ryan, recently deceased) made it public knowledge that he did not, and would never endorse Richards book The Hanged Man, because the facts surrounding Ryan life and case had been manipulated. The book was published 35 years after Ryan's hanging - only after almost every person directly involved in the Ryan case had died, making allegations by Richards impossible to retort or confirm as fact. Richards tried but failed  to bluff Opas to support the book by signing it inside the front cover, """"To Philip and Stella from Mike Richards"""". But it's no surprise that the highly intelligence and most experienced Opas was not easily fooled by anyone. The book became a toilet item.
It's ironic that User:Purrum promotes and contributes to the Ryan article from two books, which not only contradict each other, but have also been exposed to contain lies.

Furnished apartments on rent provide all the amenities which are available to make your stay comfortable and convenient. You can get all the facilities which you can get in your own home. Many times it happens that corporate have to shift their employees to different city or country for long term projects.

So, staying for such a long period in a hotel can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. Now, there are variety of furnished apartments available designed especially for corporate stay. The employees can stay in these furnished apartments having all amenities in the kitchen where they can cook homemade dishes which is not available in a hotel. There is personal washer and dryer in many furnished apartments where you can wash your clothes and don’t have to spend money separately for the laundry.
