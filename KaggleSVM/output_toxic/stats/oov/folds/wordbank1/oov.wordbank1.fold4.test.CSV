Considering that you restored the section (except that it didn't mention nazism) , you're hardly one to talk. And it's not """"political views"""". And calling Sydsvenskan """"politically affiliated""""? It's a morning paper, regional, but respected. The article wasn't even an editorial, but written by a PhD, who's written published journal articles about nationalism . 
Writing about the marches that has been held on his death day, but not mentioning that they for the last 20 or so years has not been much but nazi demonstrations is misleading.

"""I classified firstly on the basis of language used. The article on the rock band uses the phase """"lethal name like DDT"""" which indicates an anti-DDT bias on the part of the writer; there is no evidence to suggest that DDT is lethal to humans except in large doses. Without this comment I would have classified it as irrelevant.

You rejected the comment """"However, if the media presentation of a particular issue is biased towards one side of that issue, he inevitably appears to be biased towards the other, and consequently attracts criticism from the supporters of that side of the issue."""" as being NPOV. I have shown that, where media presentation in the issue of DDT is biased towards one side of the issue he appears to be biased towards ther other. So as far as DDT is concerned this statement is NPOV, and you have no reason for removing it other than to try and make the paragraph appear more critical of him. In fact, in trying to characterise his view as being biased you are adding your own POV to the paragraph. And that in the face of a guideline on biographic articles of living people that says you should not do so.

 Consecrated life 

I think the discussion of """"Tertiaries and oblates"""" is excessive detail for an article of this scope and should be dropped.  I would reduce the section to just the lead sentence and thus the last two sections of the """"Consecrated life"""" section would now read:

Tertiaries and """"Oblates (regular)"""" are laypersons who live according to the third rule of orders such as those of the Secular Franciscan Order or Lay Carmelites, either within a religious community or outside.  The Church recognizes several other forms of consecrated life, including secular institutes, societies of apostolic life and consecrated widows and widowers.

Rob Samler: """"What is a Fembot in a wet t-shirt?""""
Frank Zappa: """"Do you remember the Six Million Dollar Man...?""""

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.""",0

It's no secret that I'm not a native english speaker. I'm aware of my limits in handling english language. However I still can't see what would be so """"improper"""" in what I wrote, considering the formulation is exactly what native english speakers could read on a website made by a native english speaker.
Maybe the formulation wasn't clear enough (since someone else corrected it already), but I still don't see it as """"improper"""". This goes back to the difference between a neutral comment on my edits, and a bad-faith attack on my person. I hope you'll remember all this in our future exchanges (because no, I won't """"go away"""" and I predict many more clashes like that).

Concerning the following part of your message...These are things I already talked about weeks ago. Obviously you didn't bother reading what I wrote, and you still haven't read any of the Wikipedia documentation for contributors.
WP is a free and open encyclopedia, that anyone can edit at any time. None of its articles are ever finished, they can always be corrected, or deeply reworked. 
It's not my problem if unappropriate edits were made before I decided to modify the article. There has not been any consensus discussion that had approved your section, but anyway I'll note that even  consensus can change. As you can see, WP is based on flexibility.
And I think I have argued enough, I have explained enough why I considered your section had to be replaced. Honestly, I have not mentionned any personal problem against you or any other questionable motivation, I only remarked that rules had been ignored during the writing of that section, and thus it needed to go.
So, to finish with all that, it is not up to you to decide which article can be edited and which cannot be, or which contributor can edit which article. Because these articles do not belong to you. They belong to Wikipedia, and as I'm a part of Wikipedia, I'm also entitled to modify this article.
You've also the right not to agree with certain edits. In that case, to enforce your opinion, then you need to justify it and to explain what aspect of the rules could prevent a certain edit to be made. However, you do not have the right to prevent edits from being made just because you feel the article belongs to you and that you think your contributions are just perfect and don't need improvement.
You have no right to declare an article closed to further modifications just because you like it the way it is.

What really strikes me in your behavior, is that you actually don't give a damn about the content. Not once since you came to this talk page you bothered to argue about the actual content being discussed, nor tried to show if the rules would allow it. No, what mattered for you was only to find ways to assert your domination on articles. You're not fighting to justify or find qualities in the content, you're just fighting for a right to control articles, to maintain your version as the definite and perfect one, and to prevent people you don't like to touch articles.

This is completely anti-wikipedian. So read No ownership of articles and please stop disrupting WP. If I have to go through a dispute resolution process to make you stop, then I will do it next time you revert me again. 
And as I don't see any content discussion here, I consider this debate finished and I won't waste my time answering your claims of ownership.  """,0

Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because the collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Nazi loving greek Zervas that expelled them.  Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame.

Laughable, eh? What's so funny about it? You make a claim, yet have no logical basis to base it on. Look into this more closely, there IS a Standard English, what standard do you think the UN uses for all English-speaking countries. """"Yeah, there are many English speaking countries, but let's just use Britains dialect, for no reason whatsoever!"""", is this what you think goes on in New York? Lol, anyways, did I say that leaving Wikipedia just the way it is results in a less informative encyclopedia? I said no such thing! My argument is that the inherent nature of an encyclopedia is that ALL of the information is based on one standard, so the reader doesn't get confused, and that this inherent nature must be present in Wikipedia as well! It's like trying to subtract X from Z, and expecting a numerical answer, it just doesn't mutually comply, and doesn't work well with an organized, compiled database of informative facts. I agree with you 100% that enhancing your knowledge of dialects is important, but it's just as important as learning how gum is made, learning more about George Washington, and learning what blood is made of, in a relative sense. And this is EXACTLY why there was an article on American/British spelling differences, just as there are articles for chewing gum, George Washington, and blood, and EXACTLY why I chose to raise this issue on that certain articles Talk Page. That's what encyclopedias are for, LEARNING, but learning at your OWN careful and deliberate discretion, not someone elses.

Ok, sir, my mistake for not checking my facts, but I just assumed, obviously wrongly, that words like """"pedophile"""" are pronounced the same in both British and American dialects, but only because I've heard British people pronounce pedophile as """"PED-OH-PHILE"""". So, like a normal intelligent person would do, they would make a claim with a reasonable logic base, and not just personal agenda. And you seem to think that I've never heard of that """"ae"""" being merged as one letter, do you seriously take me as a fool? Hope not, beause only a fool and an intellect would raise this issue in the first place, and I am by NO means a fool. Well, I've made mistakes in my past, but so has everybody, right? But in the scholastic sense, I am no fool, at all. Anyways, just incase you AGAIN misread what I wrote, I didn't claim to believe they pronounce it """"PAH-EHD-OH-PHILE"""", I was just giving an example for my statement """"there are words common in both the British and English dialect that in the British dialect aren't spelled as pronounced"""". I assumed, based on my reasonings in the first sentence of this paragraph, that both the British and Americans pronounce this word, and similar words, identically. According to you, I am false on this, but I do not have much faith in your credibility, so I will have to look deeper into this one. ANYWAYS, the reason I even made this argument is that you rebutted my original statement that read somewhere along the lines of """"generally speaking, English words are pronounced as spelled, letter-by-letter"""" with the fact that the word """"color"""" is spelled """"colour"""" in Britain, yet it is pronounced """"CUH-LIHR"""". 

O.K., we're kind of going in circles here, so lets just concentrate on the main issue(s) here. There are many words that have greek or latin prefixes, yet the word itself isn't related to the meaning of given prefix(es). This is, as far as I know, just coincidence, and unfortunately, partially due to the fact that it's late and I'm tired, I can't think of any examples off the top of my head, but you should know some yourself. Actually, I CAN think of them, but I'm too lazy, and it would be quite redundant, for lack of a better term. So therefore, strictly speaking, """"pedophilia"""" is by NO accounts a word for """"foot fetish"""".

You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so. I agree with you 110% that no one is """"better"""" than the other, but """"better"""" is very subjective and I'm strictly speaking from an objective point of view. O.K., just so we're on the same page, I'll reword my argument as best I can, for I am pretty tired, so we can stop going in circles:

""""Wikipedia is a database of information, and as a database (and also an encyclopedia), there must be a standard setting, language, consolidation, unification, etc., so that the information is clear, proper, and concise. In order to acheive this unity, there must be a standard for which all other articles are based. It makes no sense not use the dialect that the majority of the English-speaking world uses, and to use one that a minority, regardless of quantitative value, uses. Therefore, since the majority of the English-speaking world uses the so-called """"American-English"""" as the st",0

 If some metals form an alloy this alloy has specifics of its own, not a combination of the different metals it is made up of. I'm pretty sure the following declaration is nonsense from a sientific point of view (emphasis mine): The overtones are a result of using an alloy consisting of multiple metals, each producing its own overtone. New bowls can also produce multiple harmonic overtones if they are high quality bronze, but many are made from a simpler alloy and produce only a principal tone and one harmonic overtone. I have heard a cast iron bowl with a very impressive rich tone - and that is a very simple alloy...
 Additionally the term """"aging process"""" in the following paragraph and the last sentence of the section """"Antique singing bowls"""" needs a sientific explanation: The aging process greatly improves the tone and centuries old antiques produce an incredibly rich and beautiful sound. I'm pretty sure the beautifully sounding antique singing bowls were sounding equally rich at their producing time. You don't find lousy antique bowls today because as soon as their metal worth exceeded their beauty or practical worth as a container at any time in the past they were molten down.

I was hoping to find an email for you, but couldn't.   Thus, I will comment here.   You look pretty young for being so sharp (just kidding).  I am an EE, as well as an attorney, but am an old fart.   I was banished from Wiki as a result of Ted Frank's false statements and relentless (and false) attacks on me for what?  Because he disagreed with my edits.  He also defamed me on WIkipedia, and threatened my husband and me with litigation outside of Wikipedia - the  threat was wholly frivolous and a bully tactic.  We told him to go for it, and we would make him look like a fool.
We never heard from him again.  For a right wing nutcase so against litigation, he surely is quick to make bogus threats of litigation.  Interesting.
I tried to explain to the Wiki clique what actually happened, but got nowhere.  That was shortly before the corporate shills editing Wikipedia were discovered.
Anyway, I am very glad to see someone held Frank to account, and protested his unbelievably biased edits.  I had never before encountered an AEI staff, and dont ever want to again.
He is a pompous jerk, ruthless, mean and stoops to any level to smear anyone who does not promote his agenda.  My experience with Wikipedia was such that I would never want to edit again.  Not worth it.  But good for you and some who are able to expose those kind of editors for who they are.

 I engaged in no personal attack. What I did what point out that Headbomb's edits were illiterate and incoherent (and incompetent in the sense of being unobservant of literacy and coherency). Headbomb himself admitted as much by correcting merely some of the illiteracies and incoherencies which I pointed out to him (while leaving most of the problems he introduced intact), of which corrections are totally unneeded if Headbomb would stop repeatedly introducing them. Headbomb's edits are purely destructive. He has added no information to the article; he has simply deleted information, and that while introducing illiteracies and incoherencies.

 He also has issued bizarrely false statements about his edits, such as stating that """"Tipler is not known for either the 'purported physical proof of God' nor any recognized quantum theory of gravity/TOE."""" Yet that's what the only two sections in the """"Academic work"""" section state that Prof. Tipler is known for claiming.

 Along with the deletion of the links to free book chapters (of which edits had previously been reverted by the Wikipedia administrator Irishguy), the pattern of Headbomb's edits show a clear intent to damage the article due to Headbomb's ideological dislike of Prof. Tipler and his work, of which is further reinforced by the personal information on Headbomb's user page. That is, Headbomb is attempting to get rid of information that would be helpful for others to learn more about Tipler and his work (such as the links to free book chapters; and the infobox """"Known for"""" field which, in the useful form in which I had it, would quickly let people know what Tipler is known for claiming: whereas listing books names and the Omega Point Theory's name would only make sense to someone if they already knew of them, and so they are either purely redundant or unhelpful; etc).

 Whereas I have an actual history of adding value to this article by writing most of the article's text, adding sections, and adding most of the references. I don't point out this fact as a claim of ownership over the articleunlike Headbomb, who has effectively argued to the effect that the supposed """"hard work"""" of his illiterate and destructive edits entitles him to keep the article the way he edited itbut rather to point out that I am actually literate and competent, and that I actually care about making it easier for people to learn about the subject of the article; unlike Headbomb's illiterate and incoherent edits, which get rid of highly useful information in order to make it harder for people to learn about the article's subject.

 The article was doing fine until Headbomb came along. He has acted purely as a troublemaker in regard to this article, due to his ideological dislike of the article's subject.

I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called """"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,"""" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax"""", or """"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation."""" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the """"""""Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident"""" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing.

 I think we should respect the data collected by Yugoslav Statistical offices. It makes no sense and would be POV if we start redefining the nationality of people. During the communist era many Serbs (as did many Albanian too) chose to leave Kosovo because Central Serbia was more developed, both economically and culturally. Many Serbs (and Albanians)who wanted to study had to move to for example Belgrade and did never come back, this happened all over Europe, and not just in Kosovo. People moved from rural areas cities and for many Serbs is was natural to study in Serbia (Kosovo did not have a university until 60s). Maybe some Serbs left Kosovo because they did not want to live in an area dominated by Albanians but it is more likely Serbs left Kosovo because of economy and education than Albanians. You are saying more than 400 000 Serbs lived in Kosovo before the 1999 war. I don`t believe this and even Serbian government have not said something like this. 400 000 is 25 % of the population and we all know Albanians in 1991 had 82 % of the population(100- 25 = 75 % Albanians + other minorities??).

For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. ♠Dil  """,0
"Hello, Zwack GB, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of deletion, you might like to draft your article before submission, then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. To start creating a draft article, just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit that page as you would any other. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

 Adam Thorpe 

Dear , with all the good will I have for your inquiry for recommendations among Adam Thorpe's ouevre, I'm afraid I must disappoint you as I have virtually nothing to offer. The loss is mine as well: a trudge to the local library revealed its collection to hold precisely zero titles of his. I've only recently discovered this author; the one volume of his I read, Shifts, was brought home from (and subsequently returned to) what we call the """"pass-around"""" box outside the library door, filled with individuals' discards that don't pass the librarians' muster for inclusion on the limited-space English-language shelves. (Resource restrictions prevent me from acquiring books by choice; happily, I'm largely content to make do with what comes my way.) I was impressed with this collection of short stories, a favorite genre of mine, and likewise noted the author's recognition as a poet and dramatist. Imagine my indignation, then, to discover he had no page in the English-language Wikipedia! As with other authors I consider worthy of promotion, I took the time and made the effort to create a page with what I could find on the Web, and was gratified to subsequently it expanded by fellow editors. Now thanks to you, I've added Ulverton to my want-to-read list. If you're an aficionado of short fiction, I can recommend some authors you might enjoy; do let me know if you're interested.

"Then the ban will probably have to be made permanent.  Your decision, admins. 

I had a sick feeling it would come to this.  It always seems to, in this day and age.

This will probably be declared my last wiki-edit by the administrators (and that's even if I'm allowed to put this on my Talk page), for I am compelled to believe that the administrators of Wikipedia will have to extend my ban permanently, not as a function of a Wikibreak, but as a function that I cannot exercise “good faith” in a consensus which does not care whether the information is accurate, verifiable, or even true.

In fact, given the current state of Wikipedia, it is no longer sufficient nor even necessary to act in “good faith” and provide verifiable information.  What is sufficient, and the only thing necessary, is to provide information the collective will accept as verified – note that I did not say “verifiable”.  If the garbage I have to put up with like on almost every meaningful edit I've made in the last eight weeks is true, the collective has already spoken and I have no place on Wikipedia whatsoever, especially because I believe that the consensus is not only wrong, but either flagrantly mis-informed or down-right stupid.

This stands in violation of basically all five pillars of Wikipedia.

First, Wikipedia is NOT an encyclopedia as long as the general public is allowed to edit it, but only in the form in which a collective will accept.

I will give a good example of this in the first real problem I ran in to about 6-8 weeks ago:

BCS National Championship Game.  I tried a number of edits to properly represent the BCS' nullification of the participation of USC in two illegal Championship Games, and removing their designation, since the games no longer are believed to have taken place.  http://www.bcsfootball.org/news/story?id=6632189   An edit war began on that subject, and the subject of Wikipedia's rules regarding “no damnatio memoriae came up.  I proposed, and repeatedly, that the concept of damnatio memoriae applied, since that was the exact penalty imposed by the BCS when they nullified the entire participation of USC in the 2005 Orange Bowl and 2006 Rose Bowl (pages (along with USC's entire 2005 season, nullified by the NCAA beforehand) I would've deleted eight weeks ago under encyclopedic verification, but we now have a conflict between damnatio memoriae and encyclopedic verification).

AND, since Wikipedia does not respect the BCS as a sanctioning body (trying to remain neutral – I'll get to that in a moment in part two!), Wikipedia accepts as valid USC's 14 vacated victories, including in a BCS National Championship Game which no longer logistically should exist.  Hence, Wikipedia  recognizes (in the form that they won the 2005 Orange Bowl) USC as the BCS National Champion – if Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and their participation in the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was also nullified by the BCS.

Ergo, we now have a non-encyclopedic, non-verifiable situation which is, in fact, false!  Only the sanctioning body can give sanction to the event, and only the sanctioning body can take it away.  (Remember this one for later, as well!)  I had respected the decision of “no damnatio memoriae, but can do so no longer, because of the fact that it creates an encyclopedic falsehood!

And because the collective accepts “no damnatio memoriae, even in cases where it applies, we now have to change one of the hardest and fastest rules on Wikipedia, on every editing page.

Encyclopedic content must only be considered verified by the collective.  That is all, and also that is the only acceptable basis for content on Wikipedia – actual encyclopedic verification is no longer sufficient nor necessary.  Anything short of that will be removed by the collective.

If I am reinstated, I am considering removal of all mentions of vacated participation in games.  That means the 2005 Orange and 2006 Rose Bowls go, as does their mentions in BCS National Championship Game, as well as USC's entire 2005 season page, replaced with notations of the nullifications.  Any other games where the participation of one or both schools are removed also go as well.  (As one example, the 2011 Sugar Bowl may also be deleted, if the NCAA or BCS nullifies specifically Ohio State's participation in the event.)

That dovetails nicely into debunking pillar number two:

If the collective is the sole basis for acceptability on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia cannot be neutral.  In fact, when the collective is mis-informed and prejudicial, on top of being inaccurate, this redoubles that, since the collective enforces the rules, Wikipedia is not at all neutral, but written with the biases of the collective in mind.

 Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans As a Governance Tool 
The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.
The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.

The thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.

And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.

Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:
1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.
Evidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.

And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.

When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.

The irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.

The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.

The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.

So what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.

Or as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh!“

"Sure. First I'm not Chomsky or Finkelstein but their POV is similar to mine on many issues. But to explain my POVand I hope I'm logicalI'm against all States. I'm not an anarchist, either; I see States as a necessary evil given the current state of human civilization. But they should not be glorified as a an end, but as a means to an end, the end being peace, security for ALL, democracy, people before profits, equality ect (progressive values). 

States should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present. As far as states created by conquest, what is important is current oppression, i.e.  ending it,(esp. state-sponsored) that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others. This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).

As for the meaning of a national homeland, it could mean the country of origin and native land of a people who have a strong cultural connection and history within such a territory , a cultural geography. There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began. And, diffferent groups can live in peace side to side, with different language, cultures, co-existing with the same country, united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values. This does not negate a national homeland, only having it based on the oppression of others. Hence, I'm able to be for a national homeland for the Jewish people in the land of Israel while at the same time I'm anti-Zionist and advocate for a binational state.",0

 Legal Action Against Wikipedia 

I've heard that rumors that legal action is being started against wikipedia as a result of this article for the following reasons:

1- the SCIMD sheild being used on this article is a copyrighted image that they refuse to remove even at the request of the holder of the copyright hence they are in violation of copyright laws.

2- Wikipedia and the users involved in editing this page, are being added to one (if not more) of the lawsuits due to the constant slander of the students and SCIMD in attempts to hurt the current and future student body?

> any comments from the posters on the above and the fact that letters from the lawyers for the school, copyright holder, and one of the lawsuits have been ignored repeatedly?

just curious 

 

To be honest, why would or should anyone care about rumors or random unsubstantiated threats from anyone on the internet? The apparent copyright status of the image is documented on the image page; anyone is welcome to comment about it there, but nobody has done so, or use any of the other mechanisms to resolve copyright concerns about media files. You should read WP:THREAT before continuing down this line of discussion.  

it is by no means a theat against anyone.  I was just curious as i had heard about the legal action being taken, and curious as to why no one else had commented about it or why nothing was done.  People are quick to post the negative and not question.  I also understand and see that if anyone trys to defend this school or post anything positive their accounts are removed and the conversation erased claiming vandalism or something else obscure, so i'm pretty sure this will be erased and my account and IP will be banned in typical fashion to surpress anything that doesn't conform.  

Sorry for jumping at you...I think I've been reading on-line ranters too long, and completely misread your intent.  

 Has anyone heard any rumors that SCIMD sued several editors, had its claims dismissed immediately, and was forced to pay damages as a result of bringing a facially unmeritorious lawsuit?  If anyone has heard any such rumors, do they have any comment?   

More seriously, Azrealist, I don't believe """"rumors"""" of a lawsuit  have you heard anything involving (1) what court the suit was filed in, (2) who was sued, and (3) what the case number was?  If not, I would assume that whoever told you the rumor was probably just some disgruntled person with a connection to SCIMD, trying to discourage editors from posting here.  (I'm not questioning your good faith, but I'm betting whoever told you the rumor is an SCIMD apologist . . .)   

From what i heard the suit or charges were being started/processed in NJ and Florida concomitantly with the other suits in progress. Sorry but i don't have anymore info than that.  If i knew all the facts i wouldn't have asked about it. 

I once heard some rumors that a poster on this talkpage did not understand anything about fair use and thought copyright meant that no one could use an image. Care to comment on that Azrealist? -[[User_talk:AKMask|ask]]

"Michael Kimmel is also frequently cited, but he's not just a sociologist interested in masculinities, he's a decidedly pro-feminist sociologist that is also hostile to Father's Rights groups.  He is the president of NOMAS and, to quote an article on the front page of his site today:

Want To Be A Good Dad? Support Mom And Avoid Father’s Rights Groups

Over the past decade, fatherhood has been all the rage and dads are naturally the talk of pundits on Father’s Day. So let’s say you’re a divorcing dad and you’re having trouble coping. You look for help on the internet and discover the father’s rights movement.

Be warned – avoid father’s rights groups like the plague. According to the pro-feminist men’s group The National Organization For Men Against Sexism (NOMAS), “male supremacist groups (“Father’s Rights”) have caused unspeakable harm to our country and to our children by encouraging abusive fathers, often with little past involvement with their children, to seek custody as a tactic to pressure a mother to return or to punish her for leaving. “Shared parenting”, “friendly parent”, involvement of both parents and other concepts that seem fair and benevolent have instead been used to manipulate courts and legislatures to help abusive fathers.

Again, these are feminist groups that, frankly, view men as biologically and culturally flawed to begin with and father's as unnecessary opining as to the beliefs and goals of people interested in father's rights and, here on Wikipedia, they are characterized as, not just authoritative sources for information on father's rights groups, but also members of those groups who act as their spokesman.  It should go without saying but quotes like the above and sources that make them would be universally reviled by anyone interested in father's rights advocacy.  When authors like this are cited it should be clarified that they are hostile to father's and father's rights and have views that are diametrically opposed to any that the mainstream FRM would actually espouse",0

Hello FlugKerl.  Congratulations on creating Richard VanGrunsven.  It is great article and well-sourced.  I have just done a little copy-editing.  The opening paragraph includes the following sentence: The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies.  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error?  It states that the number of Vans' aircraft """"produced each year in North America exceeds ... """" and compares it with """"all commercial general aviation companies.""""  Vans' aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world, not just in the USA and Canada, so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldn't be confined to North America.  Secondly, if you are talking about """"all commercial general aviation companies"""" you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.  I suggest the sentence should say:
The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies in North America.

"I am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. They say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. The reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at STP. The key here is the STP part. As with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. Similarly, if your body went rapidly from STP to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. To be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. About the closest I've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film Event Horizon, where it shows all the vessels on Justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. But still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. It seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure.",0

Hi Pterantula,

The encyclopedia entry requires attributions and references.  For example, the studies of the """"effects of Landmark Education"""" is from the third-party surveys.  If, instead, the encyclopedia entry were to have customer testimonials instead, they could be struck on grounds they are not verifiable.  (We've gone around in circles on that many times as well.)

As well, the 20 points of critique are all against Landmark Education (with rebuttals in many cases).

As for litigation, I am aware of five outbound cases:

Pre-emptive warning

1) Traci Hukill """"The Est of Friends"""" (1998, pre-emptive warning, no suit filed)

Actual litigation, outbound

 Elle Magazine   (1998, LE achieved no result)
 Cynthia Kisser  (1997, LE won retraction)
 Margaret Singer (1997, LE won retraction)
 Rick Ross       (2005, LE cancelled suit for product disparagement)

There are about three inbound cases (against LE):
 Stefanie Ney (court ruled in LE's favor)
 Been versus Weed (2002; 10 claims, 3 settled, 7 dropped;  LE was a cross-defendent)
 Tracy Neff (1997, sexual harrassment, settled out of court;  LE lacked a """"sexual harrassment"""" policy at the time and got pulled in on this)

Does anyone have anything more than this from LE's inception in 1991 (14 years ago)?  Litigation regarding """"est"""" should be on the """"est"""" page.   For a company with $70 million in revenue and over 800,000 customers of the Landmark Forum, this is a tiny amount of litigation.

I was due to stop editing anyway as the amount of edit warring was getting worse on the India related articles and I don't have time for them.

For those moderate and fair minded Muslim, Hindu's, Buddhist's, Christian's and Sikh's I say, keep editing the India related articles. Don't be swayed by the extremists. Remember the principles of Wikipedia, WP:NPOV. Always back it with a WP:Reliable reference. Be WP:Bold. Always be ready to discuss and share ideas. Don't close your mind. It is the close minded people of this world that destroy Logic and Reason.

Live Long and Prosper and see you on the lecturing circuit.

Hi, I would love to be able to help, having something of an interest in Court Line myself. However, the photography is not mine to grant you any rights to - as you point out one of them is airline publicity material and the other is of unknown origin; it may be in the public domain, but I wouldn't know for sure. You can obtain many photographs of Court Line aircraft from airliners.net (do a freeform search for """"court line"""", it should throw up fifty or so images). You will probably have more luck contacting the individual photographers through that site, since all the images are usually attributed to someone. It's also worth digging out the book """"colours in the sky"""" which is a detailed history of Court - try an Amazon search in the first instance - again, contacting the authors would be the way to go, since I believe they have amassed a large amount of photographic material and ephemera from the airline.

pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi  

My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is """"in contact with academic reserach""""? If you want to read about things that are """"in contact with academic reserach"""", you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on """"contact with academic reserach"""" to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully.

1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor.

This leads us to

2. It makes no difference whether a theory is """"notable to academic researchers"""" (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor.

You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. In so doing, you have let Wikipedia and its readership down. Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future.  """,0

Handle in text:  It is not clear exactly what the alternative  to this RFC proposal is, or what a """"no"""" or """"yes"""" might yield,  so I will spell out what I see here as the best solution. I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist.

Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza8",0

{{unblock|reason=Block serves no purpose. Given that my so-called PAs were limited to AN/I, and that I am preparing a case for RfC/U then I am hardly likely to persist. Further to the point that remarks on AN/I that are not related to content disputes are not disruptive, and therefore the block is not preventative, as there are, and have been, no concerns regarding disruption or vandalise to encyclopedic articles. My argument stands that this block is a WP:COATRACK with my """"personal attacks"""" being highlighted to mask the uncivil remarks and assertions on AN/I. Those assertions, based on undue lack of AGF, over my response to a WQA are based on straw man arguments, with no evidence to support the claims, and in fact run on a parallel track to the discussion at AN/I, but have in fact been misrepresented through synthesis to create an attack on my contribs, and cannot be reasonably analysed as a """"bad faith"""" WQA response. However, this is the tone that has been used by an admin who refused to get involved in the WQA, but did not hesitate to question my ability to respond to the WQA, which was also, notably, my first WQA response, which was concluded and closed by supporting editors. Therefore the attack on my response, which was made prematurely, perhaps an uncivil approach in itself, was unfounded. Since the close, the admin has refused to recognise their critique as a bad faith attack, nor have they refactored it recognise the conclusion of the WQA. They have, instead, used my earlier uncivil remarks, which I should not pre-dated the AN/I topic by 3 days and therefore the admins right to question my WQA response was somewhat presumptious given that the two events are unrelated, and casting doubts on an editors ability to contribute to X-area of wiki because they had a dispute in Y-area of wiki is not a logical conclusion, it is a straw man argument; i.e. """"Because MB was uncivil to editor-A on AN/I, he should be kept away from WQA"""". This flaw being, that every article, user, project and content page on wiki has a discussion page, therefore why not argue """"If MB is uncivil on AN/I, he could be uncivil anywhere""""? Having dismissed the admins argument as flawed, based in this discrepancy, plus the fact they were assuming I would respond to WQA, but it had been my first and there is no evidence to suggest I was going to make a career out of it, the admin drew conclusion based on a false premis. Those conclusions were used detrimentally and matter-of-fact, despite being opinions, theories and at most, concerns. At no time did the admin attempt to address those concerns on my talk page, as would be proper. Instead they made uncivil remarks, questioning the faith of my response and promoting a damning claim, using quotes out of context and lacking correct interpretation. I maintain that the intentions of the admin were uncivil, and that by addressing me """"potentially uncivil"""" the admin was making proactive disdainful remarks, based on one solitary WQA, rather than a reactive proposal based on sufficient history, behaviour patterns or evidence to support the theory. To make matters worse, when I confronted the admin with this they adopted a defensive stance, dismissing my anger at their assertions as uncivil, and convoluted the matter further by placing my angry response above their own behaviour, whilst casting judgement, thus clouding the issue, i.e. the WP:COATRACK counter-measure. I consider this an attack on my integrity, as my response to WQA was rejected and questioned before it was even resolved, which is a clear example of attacking the faith of an editor. Because the admin continued to accelerate their case against me with condescending remarks, and refusal to accept their straw man claim as unreasonable or irrelevant to the discussion, i.e. a fork. Their persistence to use those comments can only be observed as advocating. For any admin of that experience to be unable to recognise their own bad faith, illogical attempt to predict an editor, and close-minded approach, there has to be a underlying motive, in my belief, for them to persist, to the degree of blocking me and refusing to allow their behaviour to be questioned is paramount to enacting COI.  So, though my responses may be considered uncivil, they are in reaction to what I perceive as irresponsible admin attitude, and pessimistic misuse of my response at WQA. That is not a PA, or uncivil, it is a legit observation with regards my POV which was made to look warped due to the late-interjection with straw man based propositions, casting aspersions on my ability to handle WQA. Unless there has been a direct complaint or issue pertaining to a page, or discussion, it is not appropriate for an admin to imply anything, and therefore my one-off role at WQA is",0

This page needs to be edited down to a handful of sentences and then merged with Nose, if not altogether deleted, due to the fact that it is merely a slang term with denotions of eugenics and discredited pseudosciences such as phrenology.  The author(s) included a long paragraph by a discredited 19th century scientist named Samual George Morton, of which only five words (""""the nose large and aquiline"""") pertain to the article itself. As Wikipedia's own article on Morton says, and as most medical/science students are taught, Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of """"American School"""" ethnography, a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is generally seen as the origin of scientific racism.
The paragraphs in this article are drawn out to unnecessary lengths so as to provide the appearance of substance; particularly the Buddhism one, which uses 53 words to say that statues of Buddha should have long noses. No reference is given.
So-called hooknose snakes have upturned """"noses,"""" not downturned """"noses"""" as raptors do, thus meaning they don't even have hooknoses as the author of this article describes, thus making their inclusion truly puzzling.  I use quotation marks because neither snakes nor birds even have noses in the sense of the ones humans/primates have. Snakes """"smell"""" by using their tongues and the Vomeronasal organ inside their mouths; a snake's """"nostril"""" holes are used only for breathing. Some venomous types use their additional larger """"nostrils"""" (actually glands called pits) to sense heat, not odors.
The fact that such noteworthy intellectuals as Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton have recently had rhinoplasties does not even mean that they had, or have, so-called """"hooknoses."""" Nor does the fact that a fictitious half-man/half-ungulate creature living under a bridge in Kentucky supposedly has one, though Wiki's article on it makes no mention of a hooknose, nor has it of course ever been photographed. It bears pointing out that factors allowing the genetic merging of ungulate and human DNA apparently intrigue the pseudoscience-oriented author(s) of this hooknose article. 
Overall, no tangible factors make the term """"hooknose"""" worthy of its own entry in a fact-based 21st century encyclopedia, other than as a disambiguation page redirecting to an entry such as Pseudoscience.  This is a textbook example of an unneccessary article manufactured out of several disparate and unrelated sources by using a smoke and mirrors technique.  Why not just merge it into Nose and let real scientists/doctors hash it out, rather than secluding it in its own peripheral entry based on pop culture/hearsay/non-science?  Hooknoses are an """"I know it when I see it"""" type of thing, with no set way of being measured.  If it were quantifiable by a certain mathematical formula, then it would possibly qualify for inclusion here.  (For example, if a nose is downturned by an angle of precicely x degrees or more in relation to its main slope.)  But no such formula exists.  It is a purely arbitrary, colloquial term, with a different definition to everyone.  For example, everyone has a different definition of """"fat,"""" but there is a medical definition of obesity, calculated using a Body mass index formula.   There is no such formula for noses.  Additionally, the link given to www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620b.htm does not count as a reliable source, as it is a religious, non-scientific organization making dubious and unreferenced claims.

I do not see much chance of his aiding me because he is an ardent Objectivist and has shown an active disdain for Wikipedia administration, to the point where he caught Mr. Wolfer in a 3RR violation but chose not to report it.

There is an atmosphere of a witch hunt here and the matter is spiraling out of control.  ,  and some anonymous user have all defaced my user page.  This has also taken place on Freddy's page and Lan's, both with suspiciously anonymous users joining in.  Otheus has demanded that Lancombz apologize and make promises, but of course this requires Lan to return to Wikipedia, which I doubt will ever occur.

The attacks include a number of malicious revert wars outside of user pages.  Mike has reverted Freddy's edit of Ayn Rand with a dishonest comment and is clearly taunting him.  It appears to be working, given Freddy's angry responses.  Along with , Mike is doing much the same on Objectivism (Ayn Rand), leaving intentionally false edit comments.  I fully expect Freddy to lose his temper and go amok at any moment.  The locus of this insanity is , where they are spinning tales linking me to still other users.  They started with , but are now trying to expand it to   and perhaps others.

What we have here is a group of users trying to take over all of the articles related to Ayn Rand, using intimidation, administrator manipulation and outright deceit to get their way.  Lan might have been short-tempered, but he was clearly not delusional. At this point, I am frustrated and disgusted by the state of affairs and want only for this foolishness to come to an end.  Can you do something about this?

Isn't this a notable secondary source though?

Dr. Wood was invited to present her research on the very popular radio show, 'We Ourselves', hosted by Ambrose Lane. The radio station is WPFW 89.3 - Washington, D.C. The interview is all over the internet, but a direct link to it is here: http://www.weourselves.org/wpfw/052308.html 

Please let me know. Thank you.

  

As I pointed out on someone else's talk page, where you spammed this request:
It's not clear it's a notable talk show, and
It's not at all clear the show has a reputation for fact-checking.
Without both, it's only a reliable primary source for what Dr. Wood actually said, if that.  —   (talk) 

It's not hard to fact-check the fact that Dr. Wood's case went all the way to the Supreme Court.

That has nothing to do with it, nor is it notable.  Anyone can appeal their case to the Supreme Court (technically, request Supreme Court review, as an actual appeal to the Supreme Court can only be done on certain Constitutionally specified cases).  The Court let the Appealate Court decision (that there was no case) stand, with no dissenting justices.  —   (talk) 

Yes, anyone can try to appeal their case, but not all cases get appealed, in fact, very few cases get appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, because the Supreme Court only takes on the biggest and most important cases. In this scenario, her case was so solid and so backed by evidence, that it made it ALL THE WAY to the SUPREME COURT. 
To say that the only 9/11 research efforts ever to be filed in a court of law and make it to the Supreme Court are not notable, makes me question your integrity as a person. Amazing.
  
Ahem.  The Supreme Court did not """"take the case"""".  In fact, the Appealate Court ruled there was no potential case, and the Supreme Court did not hear the """"appeal"""".  —   (talk) 

There was a motion to dismiss by the defendents at the level of Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court upheld that motion. The case was dismissed at the level of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether or not the case was actually heard.   

(cite)?.  My recollection is that Appealate court accepted the motion to dismiss (or, possibly, rejected Federal jurisdiction against the defendants).  If there was a Supreme Court order, I'd like to see a pointer to it.  —   (talk)

 Different from 

is a common gramatical error made nearly every time the word 'different' is used.  The Oxford dictionary of English Usage states (slightly paraphrased):

""""Different is always followed by to, never from or than.  The use of different from is a common grammatical error.  The increasing use of the awkward form different than is probably due to confusion with other than.  [It then goes on about the incorrect use of the adjectival form where the adverb is required].""""

The form 'different to' was drummed into me at school.  The Americans may well use the form 'different from' as a matter or routine since they always take the easy approach but as the article is about a UK invention, British English is the required version for the article.  Pointing to internet sites that claim otherwise is not going to impress, because they are clearly making the common error, but it is difficult to weed out those that are thinking in American English.  The Oxford University dictionaries are generally regarded as the authoritative source for all things concerning the English language.   """,0

Listen, I don't believe that Greece is 98% Greek.

Perhaps the 98% figure pertains to the remaining 90% which would be something like 88.2% of the total population. I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though. What is interesting is the question of """"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?"""" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time).

 semi-protect request 

Do you know how to put in sem-protects? I'd like on on pseudophilosophy and Patrecia Scott as Alienus is using new sockpuppets to edit these. Thanks.  

Hello: this request for semi-protection on two articles is out of process  the user making the request is in a content dispute with multiple editors, and has provided no valid evidence, nor requested Checkuser to support the claim that any banned sockpuppets are editing. Editing from anon-IPs is not reason enough; particularly when the request for semi-protection comes from an editor with a  who wishes to protect his version of the article.Talk 

 Most requests for administrative intervention come from editors with an interest in the topic.  That doesn't invalidate the request, or change the fact that Alienus is not permitted to edit Wikipedia by the order of the Arbcom.  Hope that helps.   
There's been no actual evidence that any vandalism or editing by Alienus has occurred at those articles. Claiming an IP address is a banned user without proof is inappropriate, and contrary to semi-protection policy, which states,

Semi-protection should not be used:

As a preemptive measure against vandalism before any vandalism has occurred.
As a response to regular content disputes, since it may restrict some editors and not others (see the protection policy for how to deal with this).
In the case of a static IP vandal hitting a page (blocking is preferable to semi-protection).
...
To prohibit anonymous editing in general.
Talk 

 I'm pretty satisfied that the thing that is quacking, waddling, and shedding feathers is, in fact, a duck.  
When making a claims contrary to WP:AGF, it might be a good idea to actually have evidence. Can you show any edit in the  recent history of Pseudophilosophy that was either 1) vandalism or 2) an edit by a banned user? Likewise, can you show that in  Patrecia Scott  IPs 207.210.106.104 or  128.197.11.30 are the banned user Alienus, as claimed? All I see is a content dispute, and edit-warring by LaszloWalrus and for that you are not permitted to semi-protect an article. In fact, the content in the latter article that LaszloWalrus keeps removing is in the Nathaniel Branden article: """"In 1968, the close relationship between Rand and Branden came to an abrupt end when Rand discovered that Branden was having a sexual relationship with a third woman, actress Patrecia Scott. Rand then expelled Branden from the Objectivist movement.""""Talk 
 Look more closely.  Good day.   
 That certainly is not an answer; it's your responsibility to demonstrate that you're using Admin powers appropriately. If necessary, I'll bring this up at RFC for Admin conduct.Talk 
 I encourage you to do whatever you think is best.  Regards,  
Umm, I'm editing Pseudophilosophy and the gentleman in question seems only to remove the sections that he does not support.  Most of that is cited material, or documented on Ayn Rand's own page.  It is not novel or disputed, just not liked.  I think we need to be wary of such edits and protections.  If he is doing this elsewhere, that is even more problematic.  I have noticed that at least one time he reverted on the basis of 'alienus' from an anon ip, it did not look like a sockpuppet edit, and i think the continued use of this justification is being used as a trope for a campaign.  It should be ignored and forgotten.

Test tours
West Indies had their first test tour of Australia in 1930. They also toured England twice during the 1930s. They played 19 tests, most of them against England, winning 4 and losing 9. Most of the test matches had 6-ball overs but 3 of them had 8-ball overs. The test matches played had different formats (3 day, 4 day, 5 day, timeless).

West Indian captains
Most of the matches were captained by G C Grant.

The 1940s
Test tours
The 1940s were affected by World War II. In 1948, West Indies toured newly independent India for the first time for a 5 test tour. The tour was preceded by a non-test tour of Pakistan and followed by a similar short tour of Ceylon. West Indies did not lose any of the 9 test matches it played in this decade.

West Indian captains
Most of the matches were captained by JDC Goddard under whose captaincy the West Indies won 3 test matches.

 Tyrannosaurus FA 

Hi Sandy, I was wondering if you would have a quick look at the Tyrannosaurus article and see if it looks to you to meet current FA standards?  I am wondering whether to initiate a discussion on it with a view towards it needing an FA review as the text to me seems repetitive, handling of units hap-hazard and inconsistent, significant overlinking, and needing some reorganisation.  I would welcome any thoughts you may have, and to be clear I am not asking that you take on the job, I just seek the view of an experienced FA contributor.  Thanks.    
 Hi, EdChem ... I'm sorry I have been of so little use in responding to your requests for help lately !  I've been quite busy in real life, so haven't had the time for the sustained commitment needed to review at the FA level, although I can occasionally dip in to DYK for a quick source review.  (Will respond to Tony's DYK issue as soon as I can I'm more concerned about sourcing, padding, and copyvio issues than how interesting hooks are at DYK I think interesting hooks might be a concern if the basic pillars of Wikipedia were being met, and I'm concerned that DYK is still a place where not even basic pillars that apply to all articles are upheld.)   When I was new to Wikipedia, dinosaur articles were all the rage; as often happens, it seems that many of the editors who maintained those articles have moved on.  At a quick glance, I can see numerous problems (as you outlined, including uncited text) with the article, but those problems aren't as bad as many older FAs that typically appear at WP:FAR.  It's not surprising that a high-profile topic like tyrannosaurus would deteriorate after its principle editors move on. Instructions at FAR ask that editors post to the talk page before initiating a review, in hopes that some interested editor will improve the article and remove the need for FAR.  You cannot go wrong by listing some of the obvious issues on talk to see if anyone will surface to work on the article.  If no one surfaces in say a month, I agree that the article probably needs to go to FAR.  But there are so many FAs in so much worse shape ... I digress )  Best,  (Talk)

You do realize that a vast body of literature and academic works refers to the places in Ukraine solely by their Russian names, especially in historical contexts? Hard as it may be for you to believe, but an average Western reader would not necessarily know that """"Kharkiv"""" and """"Kharkov"""" refer to the same place. Including Russian names in the lede helps clarify this point, makes cross-referencing historical literature and Wikipedia articles possible, and generally improves our readers' experience.

Things are not this simple. There is much dispute over wheather the US succesfully installed a democracy, since the new government is becoming more and more authoritarian, candidates were banned from recent elections, there have been fraud claims during all 3 elections and many human rights violations have taken place. Also Iraq's status as a US ally (leave alone major US ally) is questionable, due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shi'a and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada al-Sadr's political party. Also the insurgency is far from quelled, although it's not as deadly as it was around 2006-2007, with at least 4,000 civilians, 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth.  19:26, 4 January 2011",0

(deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.

The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. 

The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:

Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.

So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.

The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.

Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """,0
"""Much of the history article is taken directly from Hillsdale's website, and I would agree that much of it reads like an advertisement, but, in all fairness, there really hasn't been enough published on Hillsdale apart from the college itself.  I have tried doing EBSCO host searches and have looked for titles in my university library (the largest library in my state, mind you), and I have been unable to find a single title that is exclusively about Hillsdale College.  I suspect the reason is that, while it was once a radical college, it has become more conservative as the world has changed.  It was expected to become more radical, in the way that Antioch College did; but it didn't.  I think that the best solution is for outsiders to acknowledge Hillsdale's impressive history while still writing about it from an objective point-of-view.  If there are other people willing to write about the school, there will be less need to visit the """"Imprimis"""" website to compose a wikipedia article on the subject.

This is childlish:

First of all, I am tired of people who show up to a page and think they have the right to add any modifications they feel like. Next time, before you have the intentions of modifying the alticle considerably (or the contents in this case) it would be wise to write down something in the discussion page, otheriwse you work might end up being in vane.
Secondly, the tempalte for the content is BY FAR THE UGLIEST I have ever seen. It quite hard for a newcomer to realize he has got to look through the text. The old content probably wasn't the best possible, but was significantly better. Also, the old content is not occupied by history in more than 50%. 
I understand Romania has a rich history, but the notion of independence was not a huge idea before 1800s. India has existed as a 'culture' long before the Roman Empire, therefore there is no point in comapring the importance of the history section of the two countries. Check the Germany article to see the model I have edited the format of the history section. You are welcome to edit the history section, but do not add 20 entries about history in the contents section (i.e.: that is why national awakening, independence and union are in the same section; feel free to modify the name, but do not further split it). Also, for similar reasons, there is little point in expanding the section about Dacia.
I might be worong, but you seem to play around a lot with the position of the images. Please do not. Right now they are placed where they are because of some specific reasons.
I will add more comment later 

Now the answers:
 You are welcome. Next time you add about 30k+ of information to an article and somebody comes and starts freaking with the article, you will be really happy.
 Appearance and professional looking? Is that what you are calling the template for the contents section? Come on, try to be objective and agrre that even the contents section on the present page is really ugly.
 I have allready replied to this and I do not feel the need to throw away some of my time to add more reasoning to this rather retarded dispute. Note: The big size also has a real outcome, and that is the article is really annoying to edit because it takes almost 10secs between the press of the save button and the reloading of the page (and it is not my connection)
 Again I allready explained this. The issue was not the byte count but the length of the contents section that took several pages to scroll down (and I think more than hald of the contents were SMALL entries into the history section).
 The article is about Romania, not about the History of Romania. Again feel free to click this link and edit. The history is there, it happened, and therefore the history ARTICLE should be expanded. """"(some of us hate to change pages!)"""" Some other readers hate to search stuff about Romania and have to scroll down through pages of history to get to some more present facts."""" Putting links is not equivilent to giving a reader a recap of the era—in particular, I find the way you did it in that page to be poorly prioritized."""" This is your opinion. The page has beeen previously reviewed by other users (check the article milistone) and they found it actually really aggreable and felt the need to specify the usefulness of the way it was 'prioritizied'.
 For exampel in Europa Yearbook (a kind of printed version of CIA Factbook that is printed yearly). Also, your example with journals is at least annoying. Journals are actually reviewed by professionals, which means that people who nt what is happening agree on those formalities. This is not Libertatea where you need to put catchy titles to make people buy your crap. This is an encyclopaedia and should have some professionalism in the way titles are given.
 I checked and decided the contents section is REAAAAALLY """"off-putting"""". It is unfortunate, but I find it fair to undo edits from people who do not ask first, than to reedit their edits.
 IT IS UGLY!!!!!! Also, what browsers? Anything that is not Firefox or IE has no weight. (i.e. even Opera is a niche browser)

Also, I did not get the joke about first of July. If you were refering to the date I have created this account, then... you are at least superficial to base your opinions on that. There are al least two possibilities that you cannot prove with this kind of research: 1) that I did not have another account before then. 2) that I did not do real publishing in real life (i.e. in real Journals, were people review your stuff before publishing)

"""== Literal text ==
I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example",0

Championship does not mean """"first place."""" For example, in 2001 the St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros tied for 1st place in the NL Central Division. MLB did not recognize co-champions, allowing only Houston to raise a banner indicating that they won the Division Championship and print the same in their media guide. By contrast, in college athletics in the United States it is routine to recognize as co-champions any teams that finish tied for 1st without applying tiebreakers. This is because the recognition of a champion is in the hands of the organizing body. Here is a great example of the phenomenon I'm talking about: http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3033084. The story says that the """"Detroit Pistons clinched the Central Division and the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.""""

In short, I know that my usage is right (they have clinched their Conference's No. 1 seed). I've yet to see that the further innovation you suggest (that they are properly a """"Champion"""") is in fact officially sanctioned.  """,0

It translates to “sensei”? It’s pronounced that way, but it translates (into English, at any rate) as “ancient sage” and usually refers to Confucius.

"In addition, you may want to read this source as presented by author Mike Campbell:   

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura",0

Wikipedia:WikiProject_Drugs
I need to start a project that automates factual changes/insertions (like rambot).  A lot of incorrect information exists in or basic factual information is missing from drug related articles.  This is stuff that can be easily looked up online and are basic scientific facts for which there is no argument over.  The information can be found from several online drug databases including rxlist.com, medlineplus.gov, the official websites of drug manufacturers (they have free, detailed information sheets) and other various websites.

I plan on writing a bot which can automatically 'rip' factual information (which is non-copyrightable due to its factual nature) and create an off-site database.  I will offer this database for free for people to download, so both they and I can work on bots that can integrate the information in articles.

This would require considerable collaboration with the drugs wikiproject people to provide a standard format for all drugs articles beyond the simplistic efforts taken so far so that I can ensure the bot will behave properly and insert information only in a correct manner.

For clarity, this is information regarding side effects, [bio]chemistry, routes of administration, drug names (brand name and genericmy bot will autmoatically look up International Nonproprietary Name, USAN, BAN and other names) as well as other clearly factual things.

A question needs to be raised regarding drug pages, how should they be organized?  The full information sheets on drugs are very large and rather complicated from a lay person's perspective, perhaps it would make sense to integrate full infomration (including the results of studies on it) on a separate """"full information"""" page while keeping the main page a summary?

I investigated the following in hopes to get a better resolution, I dont feel like the external links page shouldn't include the following if my site is not allowed because they contain the exact same things as my site, also, just because I am the owner of the site and am adding it, what would be the difference if I acted like I wasnt the owner? I I have only one link to the graffiti store once you enter the site, and its nowhere on the gallery or the top navigation, but just because I have a store doesnt mean I was posting my site in order to promote it, I was certainly not, or else I would of tried to add the store url when I added the other url. Also like I said before, my site has been up since 1997 off a different domain, and since 1999 off the current domain. We are ranked 5 on google, and get plenty of hits on our own, I was not trying to add my site here to receive more hits. PureGraffiti.com is going to be online for as long as the internet is alive, the gallery will be the biggest gallery of graffiti art online, weather one agrees with me or not, you can take a look at the stats and figure it out yourself. We are online for Graffiti Artists that dont have the knowledge or money to get their pictures up on a website that is already established and well known by almost everyone in the USA that is a Graffiti Artist. The store we have merely pays for the dedicated server bill costs to keep this huge site alive, and there are 500 other stores online that do advertize on google and other sites, we on the other hand dont. We also dont charge for the webspace, and we also dont have advertizing for money on our site in hopes to make money of our viewers like many of the sites you have accepted.

Please take all this into consideration:

http://www.Artcimes.org = first graffiti site. They have a store as well, and they have advertizing for money all through-out their site. Just because they are the first graffiti site, doesnt give them any special treatment. 
http://www.bombing.org = Advertizing for money all over the site
http://writers.org.ua = advertizing for money pop-up when visited the site.

P.S. By no means I have a problem with these sites, however, I do think it is unfair that they get to be on there when my site is the same, and does not contain advertizements to make money.

Thank you once again.

"The problem is not only or perhaps even primarily with companies, but with non profit organizations, and pressure groups of all sorts. The problem is not primarily with skilled PR professionals, but less skilled people assigned to it, or simply amateurs. There's a good deal of COI editing of companies and products done by fans of the products, not by the companies, and some degree of conflict of interest permeates most of Wikipedia. Almost everything I ever worked on is either because I am interested in it, or want to show off my virtuosity. 
And I agree with Dennis that in most cases we might as well deal with COI on the article page directly, as with other edits. King4057, and others, have asked me at times to approve article drafts they have COI with I have refused to do so, because I will not take the responsibility for something I have not written, beyond seeing it is not blatantly objectionable. Let COI editors declare the affiliations, and then their edits will be judged appropriately. The only time that an edit needs approval on a talk p. is when it is dealing with something that is obviously susceptible, such as removing inconvenient facts.   
The true question is the same with this approach as with prohibiting direct COI editing:  how do we deal with COI editing from people who do not declare it. I see only two approaches. One is to have an high index of suspicion for every edit that might be influenced by conflict of interest, in essence abandoning the principle of Assuming Good Faith. The difficulty here is that very few can write material that is truly at a standard of sourcing that is proof against the possibility of bad faithit requires not only that statements be sourced, but being confident that all the sources have been examined and fairly considered and judge in context. Very little in enWP meets that standard. This would require actual research and fact checking at a degree which is beyond our capabilities, and amounting to what is done by the most careful editorial review. This is not work for amateurs.  It is easy to say, that if our standards are sufficiently high COI will not matter, but this  The other approach is to require all editors to be identified. The principle of permitting anonymous editing makes us vulnerable; it is necessary for those working on certain topics, but there it might have to be assured by some confidential mechanism for assigning names. Either approach means a radical change in Wikipedia.    
The only simple approach is the same we have used for other problems: patiently remove the worst of it, and go from there. '''''' ( talk )",0

Maybe Tim could be the judge on what is the most suitable. Just to clarify the error in VH&W;, the omission of DQ2.2 (DQA1*02, DQB1*02) was a small error, the statement that (DQA1*05 without DQB1*02) was a """"partial DQ2"""" is an error. To understand why this is an error one has to read  which basically found that all DQA1*0501 previously type in Europe split 2 ways, DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 and DQA1*0505:DQB1*0301 (I was scolded by a referee for not knowing this and not knowing DQA1*0505 and DQA1*0501
were process to DQA1*05) DQA1*0505 is part of the DR5-DQ7 haplotype, therefore in assigning DQA1*05 without DQ2, it is a DQ7.

The """"neat, plausible and wrong"""" solution will only work up until DQ2.2 hits the reviewed literature, then it needs to be dealt with. At 4% of all coeliacs it may never reach that level of appreciation. yap 20:13""",0

 I agree with  first suggestion his neutral view matchs my last contribution which is sourced from the UN security council report. please read if you can. Somaliland is not internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia because somaliland is not like the iraqi kurdistan or puntland, both regions have some form of agreements with their central governments. E.g. those regions dont have own money, foreign minister and passports.

 Somaliland got it all and has no any kind of formal agreement with somalia. they never signed somalia federal constitution so they can be part of politicial system that has no any  agreements with them.  they can not be Automatic member of federal states of somalia unless they formally join the system or somalia invades them.

 Request opinion of Muslim editor 

Hello. Could you please stop by Talk:Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[Ousia|essense] of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[tritheistic]we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say """"Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers."""" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying """"Christianity believes it believes that there is one God,"""" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right), and if not, aren't Christians by definition monotheistic?

 Four years after writing """"my vision is that Wikipedia should not say E is a fool when all it can really say is that D has called E a fool"""" Lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article.  The preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the Eucharist in last supper, and cites the Catholic catechism, and Orthodox Encyclopedia and an Anglican Bishop.  Reading the footnotes, one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis.  And instead of reproducing quotes faithfully, or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability, the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors,  without even selective quotation.

On the positive side, I'm learning a lot about Eucharist-not from this Wikipedia article, I have to say, as much as running down footnotes,

I never knew the Eucharist was announced before the Last Supper until I read in the Catholic catechism.  That tidbit doesn't appear in any Wikipedia article I read.

The Last Supper is the institution of the Eucharist to Catholic, not the origin, according to the Catholic catechism cited here from 1993.

   """"The history of philosophy is punctuated
   by revolts against the practices of previous
   philosophers and by attempts to transform 
   philosophy into a science—a discipline in 
   which universally recognized decision-
   procedures are available for testing phil-
   osophical theses.  In Descartes, in Kant, in
   Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac-
   tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil-
   osophical Investigations, one finds the same
   disgust at the spectacle of philosophers 
   quarreling endlessly over the same issues.  
   The proposed remedy for this situation 
   typically consists in adopting a new 
   method: for example, the method of  “clear
   and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’
   Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,”
   Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen-
   stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless-
   ness of traditional philosophical theses by 
   due attention to logical form, and the later
   Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point-
   lessness of these theses by diagnosing the 
   causes of their having being propounded.  
   In all of these revolts, the aim of the revo-
   lutionary is to replace opinion with knowl-
   edge, and to propose as the proper mean-
   ing of “philosophy” the accomplishment 
   of some finite task by applying a certain set
   of mythological directions.

You further go on to say that """"Once completed, the dam was managed by Roy Sherlock until the 1970's.""""

Although I cannot contest the second statement, I cannot agree with the contention in the first sentence.  It may be that Stephen """"Roy"""" Sherlock worked on the construction of the Sennar (Makwar) Dam.  However Pearson's Contract Agent was my grandfather, John Watson Gibson.   

The entry for the Sennar Dam gives a reference to:  O. L. Prowde, The Gezira Irrigation Scheme, Including the Sennar Dam on the Blue Nile, Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Vol. 222, p. 80 (1926).

Page 96 of that document contains the following:

The scheme was designed by Sir Murdoch MacDonald, M. Inst. C.E., Adviser to the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works.  He also exercised control over the carrying out of the work until his retirement from the Egyptian Government Service in 1921.
The consulting engineers were the late Sir A. L. Webb, M. Inst. C.E., from 1914 until his death in 1921, and Messrs. Coode, Fitzmaurice, Wilson, and Mitchell, from 1922 to the present date.
Colonel L. N. Cooper, M. Inst. C.E., was appointed resident engineer in 1914, followed by Mr. E. W. Buckley from 1914 to 1917. The Author has held that office from 1917 to the present date.
The contractors from 1919 to 1922 were the Sudan Construction  Company (Messrs. E. Alessandrini and G. S. Perry, M. Inst. C.E.).  From 1922 to the completion Messrs. S. Pearson and Son,  Ltd., carried out the work. Their director in charge was Sir Frederick T. Hopkinson, M. Inst. CE., the agent in charge being Mr. J. W. Gibson.
The sub-contractors for the supply and erection of the sluice steelwork were Messrs. Ransomes and Rapier, Ltd., of Ipswich, their engineer in charge being Mr. J. R. Russell.

On this basis I propose to amend the entry accordingly.

But the language thing wasn't (tho it probably wasn't v competent either). My understanding of language issues is nothing like yours.

And the language politics in Zimbabwe are complicated, I think even more so than RSA. South Africa (as far as my puny knowledge goes) has gone from appalling but simple language values to a situation where the politics and importance of language are openly discussed and the horrors of the past give a very clear marker of what to avoid. Zimbabwe, on this as on so many things, Won't Talk about it: if you've ever doubted the value of the TRC, take a look what happens when you don't have one.

"Free Software example 

I'm not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the 'traditional' IP model is as strong as it could be. As far as I can see, the 'standard' argument for IP protection is not that it's the only way that people can innovate, but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. 

The fact that 'works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives' does not in itself contradict the standard IP model. For such criticism to be very strong, you would have to show not only that 'direct financial incentives' are not always required, but also that 'direct financial incentives' do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.

In other words, the standard IP model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. It just says that you will get more overall innovation with IP protection that you would without it. Listing counterexamples, without also discussing their wider significance, does not in itself invalidate the 'incentives to innovate' argument.

I find the remarks here of great interest, and indeed raise both issues I have considered at length and those which I have never considered before.

a) Discrimination:: clear this list maybe hetergenous, but is clearly not indiscriminate. On the contrary, groups of Masons have discussed together and made certain decisions about their relations of amity with one another This is clear discriminate behaviour. As regards notability, clear the discussion about whether UGLE recognised the Rite of Memphis-Misraim in the 1850's clearly involved political decisions taking place in consequence of the Revolutions of 1848. Involving such key figures at Louis Blanc and Guiseppe Garibaldi, this is clearly highly notable people and events. And there has yet to be any serious discussion of the role of revolutionary freemasonry in the International Workingmen's Association, which will also of couse link us into the very contraversial figure of Mihail Bakunin. Onfortunately these issues are all far too notable.

b) verifiability Well, this also relates to falsifiability and what is considered to be the truth. I have found the writings of Charles Peirce very helpful in this respect.

c) Likewise  raises the issue of original research. This means that Wikipedia is immedtiately functioning at the level of intertextuality - i.e. the information contained on a wikipedia pagelinks other pieces of text, from which peopel may infer facts or events existing outside language. I would further argue that teh distinction between original research are the difference between relying on publisjed sources and unpublished ones, institutional denioted by the separate organisation of archives and libraries. I agree with [User:ALR|ALR]] that the task is a bit daunting, however if we can entice the anarcho-capitalists who produced such wonders on teh anacrhism talk pages a while ago I am sure we can create a suitable masters carpet of information from which Mason and Cowan can freely, fairly and friendly learn from and inform their fellow sentient creatures who have access to the internet.

I do not see this as an ethnic struggle for self-determination of Ukranians and Russians from Moldovans. I see it as a naked Russian power play (and not the only such one currently) to gain economic advantage and energy advantage it can use as a lever and territorial buffer advantage against NATO expansion. Regarding the will of the people and dancing with joy in the streets, no impartial observer—and certainly no Russo-skeptic—will regard those as true expressions until such time as, minimally:
 the authorities, from the top to the bottom, are replaced with Transnistrian natives, not populated by Russian citizens including OMON thugs who transplanted to Transnistria once their attempts at thwarting true democracy in the Baltics by violent and deadly means failed, and
 Russia (and Ukranian) forces completely vacate the Transnistrian territory, that is all arms, all troops, and raze all arms depots to the ground.
When that happens, and people then dance in the streets, then I will be prepared to initiate a discussion with you about that expression being genuine.
   You keep talking about the parliament's """"opposition"""" to Smirnov. As a Russo-skeptic, I will tell you that my interpretation is not popular representation in action, my interpretation is a bunch of initially hastily organized parties which all suddenly appeared right before some """"elections"""" which are now engaged with the leadership—which has not changed since its inception—in a carefully orchestrated ballet intended to present a fully believable facsimile of representative government. We can seriously discuss the will of the people:
after every Russian in the PMR authorities is out (as in out, and out of the country);
after the foreign troops are all out (as in out of the country, and their arms depots demolished)and I don't mean Russian military retiring to become """"citizens of the PMR,"""" either;
after it is legal for a political party to be pro-Moldovan (that currently being treason); and
after Romanian is once again taught in its proper Latin script, not in some Cyrillic Soviet-era utter bastardization created purely to support the Stalinist fiction that Moldovans are not Romanians.

 Prof Rachel Baskerville´s Capital Maintenance contribution 

Prof Baskerville,

You are not allowed on Wikipedia to qoute yourself. It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy.

I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. 

Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia.

I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic.

Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article:

""""This the IASB Framework  describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways:
Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. 
So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. 

Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states:
“Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”.  These are two ‘concepts of capital’. 

Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing

-TABpayment of dividends to shareholders;
-TABreduction of a company’s share capital or reserves;
-TABa company’s purchase of its own shares

and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court"""".
So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010). Available from SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1526846

Simply because it fails to address the Ownership of the Holocaust issues which sees two mutually exclusive positions, both being accepted standpoints in society. The first being the Jewish tragedy relies on motive and the second thematic would be the mechanics argument which points to the systematic killings and the disparate groups that were killed at the numerous camps. As the article sees the Holocaust as a mainly Jewish event, it would be highly unlikely that it would be featured, else to fly in the face of academics and commonly held social views.

It is not a case of also these groups were killed, it is the thematic of groups targetted, groups killed. Lest we forget the first killed at Auschwitz were not Jewish.

 Kickstart disks 

The current article states 'subsequent Amiga models all used ROM chips' [following the A1000] in relation to Kickstart.

However, I remember that the Amiga 3000 also required such a Kickstart disk. Can anyone confirm? Thanks!

Most A3000s used ROMs, but some (like mine) had a small """"Super Kickstart"""" in ROM which read Kickstart from floppy or hard disk. (Super Kickstart was based on AmigaOS 1.4, which never appeared anywhere else.) IIRC, only the machines manufactured in Europe had """"Super Kickstart"""", but I may well be wrong on that detail. I do know that I never got my machine to boot a v3.x AmigaOS =(. Cheers, (talk) 

 Freeing memory 

(This is relevant to a different Wikipedia article). I have the statement in front of me that, when a program terminates in AmigaOS, memory assigned by the program is not freed, and that it is therefore vital for the program to release all memory that it asked for, otherwise it is permanently """"leaked"""". Is this the case?  

Memory that is not freed before termination of a program in the Amiga OS is leaked (assuming it was supposed to be freed - in some cases a program may have allocated structures and attached them to system objects, such as a device node).  One of the most common modes of testing on the Amiga was checking free memory after program exit; there were many tools that automated that.  Normal behavior of a program was to free all memory, and all malloc'd memory was automatically freed via exit-time hooks.  (I.e. leaking memory typically only happened to memory obtained via AllocMem() and the like.)   

Indeed. AmigaOS does little to no resource tracking in order to save the memory overhead that it costs to include tracking. There was also a third-party program that patched many allocate/free resource functions (e.g. AllocMem/FreeMem, OpenWindow/CloseWindow) and added resource tracking to them, however this would break any software that deliberately allocate memory then exited, for example programs which installed patches on system functions. Programs assume the responsibility for freeing all allocated memory. The standard C library implementation in most Amiga C compilers used an onexit handler that freed any memory allocated with the malloc() implementation, but if the program crashed or the AmigaOS memory allocation routines were called directly, memory allocations were not freed. Other languages had varying degrees of support for tracking memory, usually (like C) only if you used the language-specific memory allocators.  

Thank you for your replies. The reason for the question relates to a discussion I've been having on memory leak. I'm going to post a question which is very subjective, but maybe there's a consensus. The article includes """"In modern operating systems, normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates"""". Part of the debate is over whether this is really true, and whether it should say """"In some operating systems..."""". The leading question is: is AmigaOS a """"modern operating system""""? A supplementary dispute, where it says """"The application assumes that the request for memory has succeeded, and continues on this basis. This will typically result in an access violation but in some cases may result in damaging information belonging to this or (in primitive systems) some other application."""" Should this have """"some systems"""" in place of """"primitive systems""""? Thanks in advance.  

The amiga would be included in """"modern operating systems"""", and it does release """"normal memory"""" (i.e. malloced) when the application ends.  Program crashes on an Amiga do not release memory, so you could say it leaks on process crash.  And a program that uses things like OpenFile() instead of open() will leak a filehandle (and some memory) if the program calls exit() without closing the file.  As for your second question, the answer would be """"some systems"""" - many """"modern"""" embedded systems (including running unix variants like uclinux) do not have memory protection, and can read (and possibly write) structures using NULL as a pointer without an access violation.  Personally, I HATE programs that don't check malloc (or any other calls) for failure.  Good programming practice on the Amiga (due to the lack of VM) was to test programs and the OS against random memory allocation failures to see if they recovered cleanly or not.  All allocations (and all system calls, etc) should be checked for failure and",0

 The Pit and the Pendulum is a 1961 horror film directed by Roger Corman, starring  Vincent Price, Barbara Steele, John Kerr, and Luana Anders.  The screenplay by Richard Matheson was based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name. Set in 16th century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by  American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's  House of Usher released the previous year. A critical and box office hit, Pit's commercial success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. Film critic Tim Lucas and writer Ernesto Gastaldi have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent Italian thrillers. Stephen King has described one of Pit's major shock sequences as being among the most important moments in the post-1960 horror film. (more...) """,0

By the same reasoning anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue, which is what should be included in the  Critical of the Group section. This has been discussed at length above. And, although we clearly we're not able to reach a unanimous agreement on the content, we did attain a majority consensus from those of the current contributors to this page that cared to express an opinion regarding what this section should and should not contain.

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

However, you are lucky:
Q.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?

 

A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:

 

(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.

(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.

(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.

 

Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.

          

So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam

        

Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, """"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time."""" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.

 

Q.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?

 

A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.

 

Q.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?

 

A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",0

You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are """"inaccurate"""", and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull.

"I am blocked for making personal attack, i wonder what are these  , , , , last one is an abuse. the statement in question was in response to a threat by the same user, Renee, , which was noted as something which could escalate into legal threat by another user here , my response that the concern person appears to be mentally unstable  or a paid member of the group, was based on my short discussion with her, about a topic, i noticed that she did not wanted any information to be presented on wikipedia, about that particular group, taking help from admins who have declared their WP:COI .

Other user's also noted that Renee's approach is threating . My stand is not restricted to any particular group or person, but my concern is more about the direction wikipedia is moving into, as noted before, the talk page of the concern topic is now deleted, my objection remains same, there was a link on that page, which pointed towards previously deleted article and i noticed comments from 4 member's only, one was user:Jossi who has admitted that he is on pay role of prem rawat second was from User:Bksimonb who works in PR team of brahma Kumari, both of these user's have admitted their direct involvement with the respective groups, third person was User:Reneeholle, fourth user was Don. Renee has not admitted her paid involvement with this particular group, but her edit behavior clearly showed the same, Moreover there is NOT A SINGLE NOTE FROM ME ON HER TALK PAGE as i simply ignored her threating messages, which were moving more towards legal threat, as noted by more then one wikipedia editor.

I suspect her paid involvement with the group, while we were working on a temp page, about the subject, (on advice of another admin User:Will_Beback), and there one statement was made that there is dispute between two groups, and reference given was court docket, (which was taken as it is, from wikipedia's french twin of the subject). She removed the dispute section from temp page and stated that judgment is in favor of one party, and reference given was some blog !! Giving reference  of a blog, after removing a court docket from a temp page, indicates some problem, or something fishy. This heavy biasing and attempt to reduce information from wikipedia is harmful for future prospectives of wikipedia project, As the talk page which i am referring to has already been deleted, so there is no trace of that particular discussion left, if this tendency of curbing information from paid member's of corresponding groups is not checked, it may lead wikipedia into a wrong direction, or may be in that direction which is not intended.

My direct involvement with article's is bare minimum, mostly i am on talk pages, discussing the matter and letting informed people make the edits once it is agreed. Regarding calling a group a cult, is something which is based in WP:RS if there is a reliable source which refers a group as cult, I write honestly that the group is cult, as per this particular WP:RS and hence respective member's are referred to as cult member's.

I did not filed any personal attack request at notice board, for all the abuses made against me, for the simple reason that i believe that editor's are free to make comments whatever they feel is appropriate, even for abuses that were placed at either my user page or talk page, i have never taken the matter beyond placing the link for the same. 

But I am surprise to see that a comment in response to statement made on my talk page, by another user, about first user, can tantamount to personal attack, given the fact, when it is made for a genuine concern that the said thread appears to be legal in nature. My statement was either she is a paid member or mentally sick as i could not find any other reason for such threats when t",0

This article was a redirect for well over three years. Then the following material was added on September 18, 2007. Here's what I removed. ...  
==Why 'Neo'-Darwinism==
 
There is no one theory of Neo-Darwinism. The term is commonly used to refer to currently accepted mainstream ideas about evolution  , which cannot properly be called 'Darwinian' since Darwin's hypothesis regarding the origin of the variation necessary for natural selection, which he called Pangenesis, is no longer accepted by most geneticists.

Darwin recognised several problems with his theory, which he was unable to solve. In 1859, when his seminal book The Origin of Species was published, nothing was known of DNA or genes, and very little about cell biology. He could not conceive of Mutation which is now considered to be the source of novel material in the evolutionary process. His theory of Pangenesis, which he published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, hypothesised that Gemmules, his imagined forerunners of genes, carried information to the next generation by accumulating in the germinal cells or zygotes and that they changed in response to use or disuse of the organs from which they were thrown off. Though Darwin did not acknowledge any debt to Lamarck, this was essentially a form a Lamarckism, now rejected by most mainstream scientists.

Despite the title of his book The Origin of Species Darwin did not explain speciation, and he recognised a problem. For natural selection to produce adaptive evolution, he considered that the changes in individual organisms that were the material for selection had to be small. Only then could successive generations move towards an optimum state for any trait. If the changes, whatever their origin, were too large, then they would constantly 'overshoot' the desirable optimum, producing offspring that were forever badly adapted. This requirement for small change or Gradualism seemed destined to lead to stabilising selection, which was inconsistent with the observed fact that different species have somehow broken away and become very different from each other.

Darwin also assumed that characteristics were the result of 'blending inheritance'; the mixing of contributions of both parents. In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, he presents abundant evidence from animal and plant breeders, as well as common experience with human offspring, suggesting that in general some sort of average of the two parents was produced, though he recognised sports or throwbacks as the exception that was to him a mystery. He could not see how such blending might lead to anything other than the gradual dilution of variation, to the point of eventual elimination, which conflicted with the possibility of speciation. >

== History and Useage ==
The Ukranian I. I. Schmalhausen used the term in his seminal work Factors in Evolution which his colleague Theodosius Dobzhansky, described by Steven J. Gould as the central contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis described as very important to the synthesis. He says, (p175) """"The Lamarckians based their theory on the premise of an already existing individual adaptability and did not examine its origin while the Neo-Darwinians regarded it as unimportant since they assumed that the results of individual adaptability, being non-inheritable, have no evolutionary value."""" He also says, (p198), """"Unfortunately, the more recent advances of genetics have promoted the spread of neo-Darwinian concepts. Morover, adaptive modifications generally have not been accorded any place among the factors of evolution.""""

The widely used school textbook Biology a Functional Approach says: """"The Darwinian theory reappraised in terms of modern genetics is sometimes called neo-Darwinism.""""

Richard Dawkins uses the term to when referring to current ideas, saying """"that idea means quite a complicated mixture of things"""" but does not explicitly distinguish it from the ideas of the modern synthesis .

Steven J. Gould, one of the most published evolutionary theorists of modern times, used the term neo-Darwinism frequently .

hi Regarding deleteing this article as being not notable. Hi Regarding deleting this article as being not notable. the company was founded in 1824 and was an important ant horn comb manufacturer before the advent of plastics  it exported combs from England to America and the company was then very well known an ordinary thing like a comb used to be expensive as it was made of horn. The company Stockley and Wakelin does not trade any more so there is no commercial pourpose. There is another delete tag that that the article violates copyright as the material is elsewhere on the net. There is no copyright violation as the text elsewhere on the internet is my own. I am selling a Comb from made by Stokely and Wakelin on e bay and decided to do a write-up on Stockely and wakely - The comb is being sold for six pounds - so my intention to write the article on the company could hardly be for the purpose of flogging the one ccomb. Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics. Any way the article can be undeleted so that I and other wikipedians may improve on it and contribute to the knowledge of horn combs.",0

Proposed paragraphs
""""Option 1"""" below shows the two paragraphs he (Hafen) is proposing. Now that I have read the Wiki guidelines suggested to me here and in other places, I can see that this might not fly. But I need to be able to tell him I tried with the text he suggested. I have another idea for a different approach that might be more acceptable (see option 2mine,  after option 1his). I would like your feedback.

Current: (to be replaced) Hafen denies that there is a biological link to sexual orientation, stating that same-sex attraction is """"not in your DNA"""". He says that the American Psychological Association was politically motivated to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.

Option 1:
As a Professor of Law at BYU from 1973-1996, his teaching and research focused on family law and education law, with particular interests in the legal rights of children and in the legal status of marriage.  A sample of his scholarly articles includes publications in the Harvard Law Review, Harvard International Law Journal, Michigan Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Ohio State Law Journal, and the American Bar Association Journal. Two of his articles were cited in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has been an invited speaker at professional conferences on family, education, and constitutional law in a variety of international and domestic locations.

In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. A portion of his remarks summarized “the secular case against same-gender marriage.” He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children “do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” 

Option 2
In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. His address generated a wide range of responses and was reported on in Salt Lake City's two major newspapers: the Salt Lake Tribuneand the Deseret News.
(I was thinking/hoping this would be neutral, because the Tribune gave a less-than-favorable report and the Deseret News gave a more favorable report. Referencing the two could offer some balance.)

Morgellons disease: Analysis of a population with clinically confirmed microscopic subcutaneous fibers of unknown etiology
Virginia R Savely and Raphael B Stricker

Additional article information

Abstract
Background:
Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.

Methods:
Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.

Results:
The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.

Conclusions:
This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.

Keywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesions
Introduction
Morgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6

The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, ​,4,4, and ​and5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6

A matter of expression; context is important.  

""""while the forms of the buildings range from the aisleless hall of St Mary's, Waverley; to the aisleless cruciform church of St Paul's, Burwood; to the triple-gabled church of St Paul's, Redfern, the aisled church of St Michael's, Surry Hills and the clerestoried church of St Stephen's, Newtown."""" 
What we have here is five examples of typical church architectural arrangements teamed with five examples of buildings which fit these patterns. The names of the forms follow a convention (in the context of the sentence) and the names of the churches fit a convention (in the context of the sentence).    Changing the wording so that one out of five is different, in order to fit the link, doesn't work, in terms of expression.   

Also, the insertion of the word """"Anglican"""" in the names of the churches is superfluous in the context of the article, as Blacket was working for the Church of England at the time. The insertion of """"Anglican"""" into churches' names is a recent thing, and generally considered unnecessary, elswhere. While links may require the word, the context of the sentence (and most of the article) doesn't, so it's better to link as St Michael's, Surry Hills, until linking in the list below, where the full names of all the churches can be given.

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0

Fatou, Julia and Mandelbrot sets
Charles, thanks for tidying up the page I created on Pierre Fatou and looking up his born/died dates. In a later edit you added a comment about Mandelbrot sets being the popular name for Julia Sets. They are actually quite different; I updated the article with a more detailed description of the relationship between the work Fatou did, Julia's work and how this relates to the later work by Mandelbrot. The Mandelbrot set actually classifies the Julia sets - points in the Mandelbrot set have a connected Julia set and points not in the Mandelbrot set don't. The extra research was quite interesting as Julia and Fatou were coming up with their ideas at the same time and their theories were so similar, they are now referred to as the 'Fatou-Julia Theorem'.

Coase Theorem

Go ahead and change it back to lowercase if you want, but it's definitely uppercase in an economics textbook I have.

In any case, thanks for letting me know about this (it's much nicer to see people like you than people who just overwrite other people's changes without any attempt at all at discussion).  01:12, May 5, 2004 (UTC)

What did you think about my edits to the curves page. Should I start a new differential geometric curve page ?
 

No, the curve page has to mention all major aspects (this is policy). If you and  are mainly disagreeing about the order of topics on the page, that can be discussed on the talk page. You made a major edit to a page that had already had a great deal of work done it - without discussion. Obviously, the old page wasn't perfect. Now you have to discuss with Tosha, who is an expert, to clarify the issues about the page content. If in the end there need to be some new pages, OK, why not?

 

I think your edits on the curve page are very good, especially the formatting.

"""
That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,1

 How tall? 

Officially he's 5'10"""" but in fact he's more like 5'8"""" from what I could tell. Smells of scandal! His height is an issue because he's an inspiration for tiny little cute guys everywhere. They can live the life of massive impressive physical speciments if they can actually get away with it. Perhaps there should be an entry on people whose vision prevents them from correctly judging people's heights or reading a measuring tape.   

 Junior? 

With a few web searches I couldn't turn up any reference to his birth name including a Jr. that seemed to be independent of and more reliable than Wikipedia.  Also, in his autobiography  he says his father's name is Ray, and the genealogy link  someone has in this discussion page says it's Ray D. Norris.  Also, his father being Carlos and he being Jr. is inconsistent with him being named after his minister, which he also says in his autobiography.  So I changed it.
Also, both the cited NYT article and his book spell his brother's name Wieland.   

 Birth date issue? 

Astrodatabank.com quotes his autobiography for March 10, 1942?? Can someone source the 1940 date?   

 Family man quote is too strong 

Under Personal Life, after detailing how he had a child out of wedlock the following quote shows up:

""""Norris has always been a very loving family man""""

Which uses a People magazine article of him hugging his adult sons as evidence.

This seems to be pretty weak evidence for this assertion.

I'm doing something over on WWE Championship and the champions' list to make a point.  If what you believe I am proposing here with Daniel Bryan is WP:Crystal, then the entire current WWE Championship scenario is also WP:Crystal, and we don't even have a verified idea as to who is WWE Champion is or what the valid lineage is at all.  For the same reason, is the """"vacation"""" and tournament similarly WP:Crystal, especially given some very real storyline questions which were never really addressed?  This is why you default back to what I stated when I quoted you Wikipedia's own """"not a crystal ball"""" situation.  Under your guise of WP:Crystal, not only do you reverse any mention of Miz/Mysterio, you must also reverse everything which was announced on the 7/18 RAW, including the title strippage!

Do we lock up pages on Nazism because of would-be contributors' abuses of Godwin's Law? No  because Wikipedia utilizes editorial scrutiny when an article is tainted with undocumented allegations and inappropriate personal sentiment. If Wikipedia can streamline articles on Hillary Clinton and Rush Limbaugh despite public animosity, they can do it for an article on Jade Raymond. As long as the public record is noted with specific references, the strengths of the article should outweigh its disadvantages.

Apart from Raymond's unquestionable level within her profession, as evidenced by her non-PR work with Sony, et al., one of the main reasons to allow the entry is to chronicle the extraordinary and documented pitch of sexual harassment that was directed against her on the internet and within the gaming community once she became a spokesperson for Ubisoft. Hers has been a unique situation, and sexual harassment is an important issue because of her status as a pioneering woman in the gaming field.

No need to """"put the brakes"""" on an article in which the achievements of the subject warrant a sober entry, and even the worst aspects of the controversy have lasting cultural resonance.

 islam the religion of peace???? 

My mind is not able to accept the fact that islam is a religion of tolerance,humanity,love etc. why? Let me elucidate it -

islam is the only religion which is spread through force or by giving some benefits to man as they will force woman & children to convert to islam.The benfits include four time marriage,divorce can be done by saying """"divorce-divorce-divorce"""" & you can """"buy"""" another girl & force her to marry with you by giving some money to her father.muhammad himself married to a 9 year girl when he is 60 year old fat ball (Yes muhammad is a pedophile).

Some of the ugliest punishments is reserved for islam like beating to death a woman or man by stoning(as this is happening is various muslim nations),beheading,lashes etc.

Womans are treated like animals & there job is restricted only to give birth to as many childs as they can(untill she dies giving birth to yet another child).They are forced to wear """"burqas"""" in public & to have a white plaster on face in home.

These all things attract only those people from a society who thinks that this is the """"opportunity"""" to satisfy there desires.They are ofthen those individuals who have lowest ethics in life.

And why muslims are spread all over the world? ,The reason is that as all societies in the world have some real opportunitists,cowards in some number then only those choose this religion,this is unlike HINDUS & SIKHS who are mainly concentrated in south asia initially(Now they are going to other parts of the world).

Now some of the muslims are even not fully confident about islam, they know that in todays world practicing this religion in it's full version is not possible so they have created there own version and labeled it as """"tolerent islam"""" that means that even they also knows that islam is not tolerent in it's full version.

How is it possible that you pick one thing from islam as per your convenience like only jehad is picked up by muslims all around the world.

Today even muslim don't trust another muslim(not to talk about another religions) most notabley is the numerous fighting between muslim countries & muslim groups like iran-iraq,balochistan-pakistan etc.This is why they are not able to achieve muslim ummah or unity of muslims.

Only muslims are fighting in all around the world(as they are intolerent towards another religions) name it chechanya,palestine etc.As long as they are in minority they live quietly only waiting for an opportunity to come.And also multiplying there numbers(thanks to 4 marrigies & 10 childs per marrige).Then they start the fight for a separate homeland.

"When creating a definition that effectively conveys information, we can't eliminate things that condemn ourselves.  I realize that self-incrimination goes against human nature, but we can resolve the discrepancy by taking incrimination out of our definitions.  Terrorism, for instance, doesn't have to be pejorative.  We can talk about it simply as a method of war or influence.  If terrorism isn't evil, then it doesn't matter if Israel includes terrorism as one of its tactics.
You may think that stripping any implication of terrorism from Israel is good for the Jewish people, but let's look at the big picture.  In the information age, we can no longer keep people from researching historical data.  Trying to subvert this information only serves to show the bias of those attempts.

I think your understanding is incorrect.  LR(1) grammars are also parseable in O(n) time; see: Knuth, D. (1965) """"On the translation of languages from left to right.""""

In short, LR(1) parsers are strictly more powerful, but more difficult to write.  That's why parser-generators for LR(1) and related classes, are popular.

I think you might be confusing LR(1) with """"generalized LR"""" or """"GLR"""".  This algorithm can parse any context free grammar in worst-case O(n^3), but is vastly more powerful than either LR(1) or LL(1)  in fact, you can reduce any instance of binary matrix multiplication to an instance of context-free (and hence GLR) parsing, so we'll unlikely to ever find an algorithm that runs faster than the fastest matrix-multiplication algorithm.

I recently was involved in creating the wikiproject Dentistry Assesment box see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dozenist#Bot_to_update_articles.3F

 

Furthermore the bigger and more organized the project is, it can bring so many articles to FA status, and lots of main page attention; Have you noticed recently that in every few days there is an article on the main page which is related to India? Wikipedia:WikiProject_India. (Plus in their project they have admin participants).",0

"the truth 

PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:

The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.

Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.

Well, now I see why I missed your comment the first time...it wasn't even on my talkpage; I read it on someone else's talkpage (Broxton's) and got confused, haha.  But anyway, yeah.  To give a good example of a """"cup of coffee"""" MLS transaction, let me go back to Toronto's actions in the expansion draft of 2006.  In expansion drafts, clubs have the option to """"protect"""" a certain number of players while leaving others """"unprotected"""".  Unprotected players can be drafted at will by the expansion franchise (Toronto in this example), who can take one from each team.  One of the league's clubs, Real Salt Lake, made a strategic gamble that they could leave one of their key/totemic players, Jason Kreis (now their manager), unprotected.  They assumed that TFC would want nothing to do with an aging player whose oversized salary would be a big hit on their cap.  Seeing an opportunity, Mo Johnston at TFC took Kreis from RSL in the draft...not because he actually wanted Kreis, but because he knew that RSL still needed him.  By doing this, TFC was able to briefly hold Kreis hostage until RSL agreed to trade something else of value to get Kreis back.  So, Kreis was briefly a TFC player, but only because he became a pawn in larger machinations.  Because of instances like this, which are common enough throughout league history, we seem to have a consensus to disregard in-and-out situations during the offseason.
And for a bit of further detail — not relevant to Atieno and USL players but important as a point of reference for many other US-based players — it should be noted that MLS has a single-entity corporate structure, and that technically all players are contracted by the league itself, not by individual teams.  This means that all listings of player tenures with MLS teams are de facto in the first place, and that gives us a bit of leeway in striking out certain unimportant and very temporary tenures, as in the example given.  Hope that helps. ''' 《Defender of Open Editing》''' """,0

This poorly written Wiki article attempts to make it appear that ancient Macedonians were distinct from ancient Greeks. I would gambit the article is largely edited by people from Fyrom/Republic of Macedonia with irredentist aims towards Greece (contrary to both US and UN resolutions to refrain from propaganda against Greek Macedonians). Despite the occasional voice of objections there is no major dispute among most scholars that ancient Macedon was inherently Greek in nature. (at least more than anything else) The Hellenic age (the greek word for what we in english call """"greek"""") is evidence beyond dispute of this.

 To give an example of historical distortions found in this article...

""""Macedon or Macedonia (Greek Μακεδονία Makedonía) was the name of a kingdom centered in the northern-most part of ancient Greece, bordered by the kingdom of Epirus to the west and the region of Thrace to the east.""""

By saying the """"northern-most part of Greece"""" it makes it seem like it bordered Greece. There was no """"Greece"""" state in ancient times... there was only a collection of autonomous city states and Kingdoms that self-identified as Greeks. (Mycenae, Athens, Argos, Ithica, Sparta, Macedon Corinth, etc...) 

Another example of irredentism.... the wiki article states....

""""It became increasingly Atticised during this period, though prominent Athenians appear to have regarded the Macedonians as uncouth[3].

 This statement is very deceptive. It was common during times of conflict for Greeks to label each other """"barbarians"""" (non-greeks) as an insult. (similar to saying """"unAmerican"""" today) 

 While Demosthenes used """"barbarians"""" to describe Macedonians... he also used it describe the Athenean orator Aristogeiton [Aristophanes, ‘Nephelae’ (line 491). And even Demosthenes himself as described by as a """"barbarian"""" by Aeschine. Plato characterized the Lesbian Aeolic Greek dialect as ‘a barbarian register’ while addressing Pittakos of Mytilene. Athenaios VIII 350a  Socrates calls Strepsiadis “ανθρωπός αμαθές ουτώσι και βάρβαρος“.  (Strepsiadis…was a well-known Athenian) - Protagoras 3410 etc... etc... There are countless instances of Greeks describing each other as barbarians.

  There are other examples of bias in the article but the most telling is how it lightly brushs over the Hellenic period of Macedon (similiar to the golden age of Athens).... in which Macedonia spread the Greek Language, Greek culture, and Greek ideas to the region. They unique flavour of macedon among Greeks... was very similar to how Athens also had unique aspects to it... as did Sparta... as did most of the Greek mini-states.

 If Macedon wasn't Greek.... then Greek philosopher Aristotle wasn't Greek either (since he came from Chalcidice in Macedon). To go down this road we would also need to rewrite a fair portion of Wiki articles related to antiquity and the Hellenistic period. To do this to suit the political needs of a country whose population is roughly a quarter Muslim and most of the rest are ethnically slavic (who have called themselves Yugoslavians, Serbians, and Bulgarians in the last hundred years) amounts to roughly helping the Taliban blow up Buddhist statues for political ends. 

 Because of political nature of the article I would advise a complete rewrite by people will credentials in ancient studies. History is not a popularity contest. Just stick to the facts as we know them.  What's ironic is that virtually every last piece of """"evidence"""" that Macedon wasn't Greek... is either translated from Greek or comes from Greek artifacts. The citizens of Fyrom can't even read inscriptions from Macedon... as they are almost all writen in Greek. (Their own """"Macedonian"""" language was called Bulgarian less than a hundred years ago)""",0

Scotland (Gaelic: Alba) is a country that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south with England. England (Cornish: Pow Sows) is a country that occupies most of the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares land borders to the north with Scotland and to the west with Wales.

Northern Ireland' (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann'') is a province that occupies the northeast of the island of Ireland.

 Cleanup 

The constant edit-warring on this short little article has got to stop, so I'd like to bring up the edits by  in the hope of generating some discussion and reaching a long-overdue consensus.

1. The first sentence says tomoi is the result of """"Siamese influence in the area"""" and provides two references. However, this is not in the given citations. These references deal with the history of the Thai community in Kedah, but make no mention of tomoi or kickboxing. Am I wrong?

2. The word tomoi is usually said to be a cognate of dhoi muay rather than a derivative term. Anyone fluent in both Malay and Thai will be aware of the many cognates such as the words for """"lizard"""", """"door"""", """"key"""", and the numerous Sanskrit-derived terms. Muay or moi comes from the Sanskrit mavya, therefore it would be incorrect to say that one derives from the other. They are similar because they come from the same source and because the two countries are neighbours.

3. I wrote in the article that tomoi in the Malay language refers to the local style of kickboxing while tinju is the generic word for any boxing art, particularly the western kind. I sourced a dictionary for this sentence. Yet the sentence has been edited and now defines tomoi as the """"sport of Siamese Kedah"""", while still retaining the given source. In other words, it's not in the citation given, once again.

4. Why is so much emphasis given to Kedah when the art is most often associated with Kelantan? This is consistent with the sources provided since all of them mention Kelantan. A major reason why the sport is not so well-known today is because it was banned in Kelantan where it was most popular. The state government even planned to rename tomoi """"Kelantan boxing"""". Yes it is practiced in Kedah and other states as well, but to state conclusively that tomoi comes from Kedah is simply not supported by any source or even general public opinion.

5. The first few sentences of the history section are atrociously-written and repeat some of the same material which I had already written in and sourced.

6. Language like """"it is a clear fact"""" seems pointy.

7. The first paragraph of the history section does not deal with tomoi or any martial art. Why does it matter how many temples are in Kedah? What does the dominant religion or language of the state have to do with anything? The same two references are provided for the paragraph once again, and neither are relevant to the article. But the sourced paragraph is followed by the sentence """"The art of """"Tomoi"""" or """"ToiMauy""""(ต่อยมวย) were teach and practice among these Siamese communities in Kedah and Kelantan"""" which is unsourced and entirely POV.

8. The origin of Indochinese kickboxing is a disputed topic. Authors like Draeger mention Chinese and Indian influence on muay Thai, which can logically be extended to tomoi, pradal serey, etc. But then there are those (unreliable) sources which claim bokator as the common ancestor. I thought it fair to say that their origin is unclear. Yet the article states very conclusively that tomoi is of Siamese origin and goes on to mention the regional styles of muay boran. Silat Embo (the precursor of tomoi) and Siku 12 (a related style) are not mentioned.

9. """"It is also a clear fact that the system of Tomoi, be the guard,stance,and striking techniques, is identical to Muay Thai."""" This is actually true. And putting aside any modern political boundaries, tomoi is the same as muay Thai and Muay Lao. I can say this from personal experience. However, that doesn't necessarily mean tomoi came from muay Thai. As mentioned before, they may all have their origins in Cambodia or somewhere else.

10. The history section continues by saying that boxers originally wrapped their hands in hemp ropes, and provides an irelevant source which only deals with muay Thai in Thailand. The editor then goes on to say that these hand-wraps did not exist prior to Ayutthaya. First of all, boxers fought bare-fisted before the custom of wrapping the hands. And more importantly, sources like Draeger say the date at which boxers first began wrapping their hands """"cannot be known with certainty"""". And even if the practice does not predate Ayutthaya, that doesn't mean it comes from Ayutthaya. And even if it does, that doesn't mean tomoi comes from Thailand. That's quite a stretch.   """,0

Also, you must consider that politically heated articles more than often are not like others, and there might be incivility, but as long as there is a relevent exchange, administrators shall rather edit such incivilities unless it becomes overboard and incivility and personal attacks becomes a members only way of answering. In such articles people deal with pov pushing, and repeated edit warrings ad well as incivility, unless as an administrator you do not take the time to understand the context, it is for you futile to throw a warning because of one or to displaced words in an edit of hundreds or perhaps over a thousand word. Now, since your block is not justifiable, I request an unblock and I am ready to forget this incident.  (ix)

"""RfC: controversial multi-page move ==

 Summary by 89.101.221.42  

The issue is a recurring one. Proponents wanted:
 Ireland → Ireland (island) (or a variation)
 Republic of Ireland → Ireland (state) (or a variation)
 Ireland (disambiguation) → Ireland (or a variation)

Several different polls were opened simultaneously on (old page names):
 Ireland
 Ireland (disambiguation)
 Ireland disambiguation task force

A related poll had been run exactly one month earlier at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland

And one month before then again also at (old page name):
 Republic of Ireland (archive)

Participation at the Ireland page was widest and consensus was against the move. Participation on two (recent) polls at the Republic of Ireland page also had wide participation and fell heavily against the move (both were closed). Participation at the disambiguation and task force pages were limited, but consensus in those polls came down (weakly) in favour of the move.

On this occasion the closing admin was:
 

Initially, Tariqabjotu performed the move request in error - having only seen the request at the task force page. When this was brought to his attention, he posted a response on this talk page. His decision was to maintain the move against consensus as consensus had arrived at """"an illogical conclusion"""" (which he linked to Wikipedia:Polling is not a substitute for discussion). Later, he would comment that he had not read the discussions because, """"There's so much stuff to wade through..."""".

Issues believed to be at play:
 Forum shopping
 Vote stacking
 Consensus
 Polling is not a substitute for discussion

(Some) issues at play during the discussion:
 Disambiguation: Is there a primary topic?
 Naming convetions: Controversial names

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post.

Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished.

 Fermat aware of Euler's result

Remark 4.15. As mentioned in the literature (cf., e.g., [Lenstra, Lenstra, Manasse, Pollard]), Fermat probably knew the previous theorem, although its proof was given later by Euler in 1747 (see [Burton, p.219]). However, it is then unclear why Fermat did not apply this theorem to the factorization of F5. It was sufficient to divide F5 only by primes of the form 64k + 1, and for k = 10 Fermat could have convinced himself that his hypothesis on the primality of Fm did not hold. Concerning the factor 2142.27 + 1 = 274177 of F6 (see Figure 1.2), we note that there are 370 primes of the form k27 + 1 for k < 2142.

Plot
 Lt Cmdr. Worf... is it standard to use the abbreviated position titles on Wikipedia, in the first reference to a character?
 The link to the USS Defiant actually links to the ninth season episode of that name.

Two changes made direct to the article, please see the history section. Otherwise, plot is good to go.

Directing, cinematography and music
 “Original tribbles writer David Gerrold”... referencing the episode, you should be capitalizing Tribbles, perhaps even quotation marks around the singular word?
 Is it possible to briefly mention that Jonathan West wasn't an """"out of the blue"""" choice, that he was their director of photography, and had directed 1 TNG and 2 DS9 episodes before that? Even just the DP bit.

Filming and casting
 Deidre L. Imershein's role as a crew member is mentioned in the infobox, but should be reiterated in this section. First time reading through, I thought that she might have been playing a pleasure girl again, on the space station.
 “friend of one of the crew” can be confusing, considering the staff of a starship are a crew. Perhaps “series crew”, “production crew”, or something?

The question of whether EM radiation can be treated as a classical EM wave or as a collection of photons is entirely dependent upon whether the number of photons collected in a measurment is large or small. If its large, then the classical treatment (i.e. spectral radiance over infinitesimal frequency bands ) will apply. Planck's law as stated in the article, calls  a spectral radiance, which immediately implies a classical EM wave, no reference needed.  Photonic emission is for any EM radiation where the number of photons collected is small, including Planck's law in certain cases. """"Broadband"""" means the radiation is spread out over a relatively wide bandwidth, """"narrowband"""" means it is not. Broadband is not necessarily photonic, nor is narrowband necessarily classical EM.

I know allegations of admin abuse require clear proof, but it may be below. See, I wouldn't mind so much if I knew what bad behavior I was doing. I have in good faith begged and pleaded for anyone, anyone with expertise or experience to explain what was blockable; please take the time to review considerately. At virtually every turn, when I requested a policy clarification as a 2-month user, if I even got a cite, it was only to a whole policy page, and never with a diff to my alleged offense. This behavior is so consistent from so many users that it is hard to explain, much less to provide sources for this possibly exceptional claim. But let's please start with what points I do get, and the questions I need answered first by you, the reviewer:
(N.b. I wrote this the first hour of block. I trustingly clicked Save and did not realize that there would be an edit conflict due to the edit warrior (below) closely following me and stating her block agreement """"sadly"""" (huh?) and giving nuanced advice and compliments (unhelpful). This minor frustration can be gotten past, but of course this request is now many hours late. PLEASE at least quickly indicate willingness to answer.)
See whole discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:POINT is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to WP:V (my first policy suggestion) and disclosing what I regarded as an edit war about the issue. Instead of any comments on the merits (except one positive one), I received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because (apparently) it was obviously unnecessary to answer. Q. When one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one's person and presentation, is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits?
See whole user discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:HAR (first I've heard of this charge against me) is intended to refer to my appropriate-level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess, of course. After he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith, he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith. My links there indicate specifically what behavior I referred to. I know of no other case which might come near to harassment. Q. When one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith, is one harassing?
See whole COI discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:DE is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with COI, along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have COI. Certainly I might have been overstrong in that edit (I recognize not noticing the 200-word limit, but I adverted that myself). But again, there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by COI. There was one attempt at googling me (and I'm not looking up the personal details policy right now) which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as """"considerable involvement of ... promotional activities"""". Recall there are about 60,000 Ron Paul Meetup volunteers, and nearly that many donors. If I worked for a 60,000-member workplace there might be a bit more point, but even that would be debatable in good faith. Q. Is every political donor or Meetup member forbidden from editing candidate-related articles neutrally, or only those who willingly disclose the relationship?
As near as I can tell, there is a further potential application of WP:POINT (which by the way is an application of the rule, convenient to the generic, that a generic warning is fungible with any warning). Apparently I don't realize that, in some sense, these users are every one justified in refusing to explain specifically any of their adverse actions against me, and that I am being disruptively pointed if I explain specific charges against them, citing policy and diffs. And there I do admit not understanding. The policies are no Procrustean bed, but very specific. I am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one's best to WP:AGF, to complain properly and carefully, and to accept potential suffering for it. However I'm essentially barred by generic threats (yes) from complaining specifically, and I'm completely certain that a generic, unsourced complaint from me (as appears to be the",0

There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker.

The article is impossibly long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now.  Note that I was able to put estimative/analytic material in for Korea and Cuba. Much data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual declassified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc., gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial """"dirty tricks"""". That's not NPOV.

Many sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers).

I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. 

Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out  but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.

It is somewhat difficult to respond to your statement due to the length of it and the huge poutpouri of points you make, but I will try.  

I want to stay focused and make, specifically, a case for the inclusion of a reference to the desolate state of urban Detroit in the introduction to this article.  First of all, though I hate to flash credentials, let me point out that I am not some urban partisan of one city or another: I am a graduate student in urban studies, and my goal both on Wikipedia and in my academic career is to understand and describe urban processes.  I agree with you in as much as most articles on cities on Wikipedia are exaggeratedly positive: alas, but boosters have their way on these topics.  Most major city articles could use to be more critical.  The Detroit one is simply one glaring example of the difference between real life and its presentation here.

You contradict yourself multiple times in your response (and, for the love of god, stop tinkering with it!  It distorts the appearance of our conversation).  How can you claim that New York City is """"five cities"""" (only two of the boroughs were incorporated as cities before joining into a single city in 1898; today, they are tightly bound by transit and employment patterns) and yet demand that the unfocused, sprawling Detroit metropolitan area be considered one city?  How can you stick to an arbitrary statistic about the wealth of Oakland county, and yet deny the significance of the fact that most statistics (even those that address metropolitan areas and not just urban municipalities) place Detroit near the top of the list of the most dangerous? 

The point that this article needs to make is obviously not that the Detroit metropolitan area is poor or that it is deteriorated; both of those statements are obviously false.  Rather, it needs to make it abundantly clear that the metropolitan area contains inside of it a vast segment of abandonment and crime that continues to be in decline for over five decades.  The existence of upper middle class suburbs of relative wealth and low crime do nothing to make the deterioration of the urban core less notable; neither does the recent redevelopment of a piece of that core.  

I must point out your focus on New York City is rather misguded  its deterioration and crime are now of a historical character; if Wikipedia had existed twenty years ago, one can only hope that it would have focused on NYC's urban wasteland character more.  In response to your other points, I would like to invite you to join me in patrolling the self-promotion of all city articles on Wikipedia.  You are certainly right, many of them do deserve to be less positive.  Let's start with this one.  

But, alas, I doubt that you will accept my invitation.  The history of your edits shows you spending much of your day chiseling away at the language of this page to make it more favorable towards its subject; are you paid to do this by the city's tourist bureau?  In any case, I can only hope that the casual reader would know to pay this page same kind of attention they direct to the boosterist propaganda spread by local town publications.""",0

Leejc is absolutely right. He did a better job expressing what I tried to say back in June, 2007. But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that """"we must assume the worst,"""" to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.

The ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term """"event."""" When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an """"event,"""" it is an """"occurrence."""" """"Event"""" is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: """"heads"""" and """"tails."""" There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.

If I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include """"black card,"""" """"spade,"""" """"honor card (TJQKA),"""" """"Ace,"""" and """"Ace of Spades."""" The occurrence """"black card"""" can be in the event """"spade"""" or """"club"""" as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of """"spade"""" is also an occurrence of """"black card,"""" but the event """"spade"""" is most definitely not the event """"black card."""" Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.

There is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?

The first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.

The incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the """"event"""" matches the observation """"the box has at least one gold coin."""" This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event """"the box has at least one gold coin.""""

The correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.

I have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says """"Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and..."""" and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?

This occurrence can be described as """"a two-child family includes at least one girl."""" But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set """"a two-child family includes at least one girl."""" So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.

The correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to """"you opened a drawer with a gold coin"""" in the Box Paradox. You can count four possible occurrences of that event. In two of those four, representing a single family, Sarah has a sister. The correct answer is 2/4, or 1/2.

"It is just like synthpop being a precursor to techno. Synthpop is white music whilst Techno is black music. Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I have studied theology for years, and all that I can say is Liberals haven't a clue of what Christ meant about everything because they twist the scriptures to agree with their own egos. There is no such thing as a Liberal Christian, only a Liberal.

Fair use rationale for Image:Losmejorescd.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Losmejorescd.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """,0

I don't believe the article section is about uncovering the truth of their claims.  The only fact necessary to presenting that viewpoint is that they've claimed it.

Wrong licenses
I have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. The exceptions are:
:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. 
:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).
:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.
:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". 
:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.
:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.
:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.
:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.
:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).
:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.
:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.
:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?

There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)

In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:
Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);
Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:
I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.
E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license. (This would be the best choice if the author doesn't want to reveal his identity on Wikip",0
"Reversion of PFS Conference 

Since JDWOLFF is being a Wikipedia Nazi I have moved discussion to the talk page.  In my opinion, the information I have included is very germane and significant.  It demonstrates not only that medical practitioners are taking Post-Finasteride Syndrome seriously but also informs to those who may be suffering from negative persistent side effects from Propecia and Proscar that there are current ongoing studies.  While it may not be apparent on this Wikipedia article because JDWOLFF is very aggressive to remove comments he doesn't like, there is an ongoing controversy relating to the side effects of taking Propecia.  Many men have disregarded the claims since a handful of doctors remain ignorant to the potential risks of the drug and have been misinforming their patients only to lead additional patients to suffer what seems to be permanent side effects.  Please state your case as to why the information about the conference should not be included or else I would put it back up.

Additionally, I do not believe that JDWOLFF's edits were in 'good faith' was was suggested in the edit page.  His excessively hostile tone in commenting on his edits shows he is bringing more emotion than rational thought to the discussion.",0

"Dougweller, you lied in this edit summary and you had clearly seen the discussion here, with Aoid insisting on the need for consensus before changing Aesop's Fables from the status quo to Mzilikazi's hijacked version. Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it?

Besides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that. Now that the article has been rejected, I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects, as well as more feedback from you. Perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects.

Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The """"Allegiance"""" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. 

I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters.

It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign  (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

 Israeli art students 

Thanks, Umeboshi! Yes, it has surprised me how quick on the draw (and vituperative) some folks have been in expunging any reference to the alleged/purported/apparent Israeli espionage. As happens in other contexts, I think some people conflate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism  or conflate this intentionally.

Do not be pathetic! I do not take anti-Polish views and do not make anti-Polish edits. (Unless, of course, you consider deleting Polish POV as making anti-Polish edits.) Provide evidence if you believe it is not so. Also, I am by far not the only one to react to your behaviour here.

You ask me about my nationality. I will not tell you as I believe nationality does not matter on Wikipedia. However, contrary to you I am not at the same time 1 a self declared Czech (when talking to editors with Czech ancestry), 2 a European (since the beginning of this calendar year), and 3 a Pole, whose grandfather was active in preparations of the Polish occupation of Zaolzie (when talking to your fellow Polish editors).

If you talk about your achievements, why do you not mention that you were several times blocked (once even by Jimbo Wales) for personal attacks or incivility? Why do you keep quiet about being desysoped because of bad behaviour in a dispute relating to ethnic issues?

In relation to the latest edits in Cieszyn and Český Těšín (the Austrian census of 1910) do you still believe there were no Czechs in town or did you """"not know"""" at that time (""""… It is not a POV pushing from my side, I would do the same for the Czech minority, if some would be here. …"""")?

Do seriously think of your approach. You have my sympathies in preserving Polish traditions and ethnicity in Teschen Silesia but I will keep on strongly opposing your POV insertions. They do not belong here. This is Wikipedia.

My argument is that your claim is soapboxing, something not supported in the sources.  There are no sources that say those other ideologies are """"just as diverse"""".  Besides, the issue isn't about diversity, it's about how related they are, whether all the ideologies have common roots from which they all evolved, or whether they have distinct unrelated sources.   The complete dearth of sources describing any one of those other ideological labels as being comprised of distinct ideologies with original unrelated sources is telling.  They are not """"just as diverse"""".  What is deficient about this argument?  It makes no reliance on all sources about libertarianism making this observation.  By the way, referring to the distinct ideologies as """"variants"""" does not preclude the possibility of them being distinct with separate/unrelated origins.No one is questioning the complexity of Conservatism et. al.  Yet that article never-the-less correctly associates the topic of that article with the political ideology of the U.S Republican party, just as this article should associate the topic of this article with the political ideology of the U.S. Libertarian Party, something you oppose (see below).

I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the """"two species"""" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life. At least this way, people will find the article if they need to. Oh, and thanks for rescuing the conservation status of the Steppe Field Mouse.

I wonder if there is a way to highlight the independent vote (which will likely  outstrip Lib Dem and UKIP's vote nationally.

Based on these figures, he determined that by 1950, some 21% of whites (about 28 million people then) had black ancestry within the last four generations, and he predicted that this number would only grow in the decades to come.[/quote]

"Criteria for Statistics Column 

Hi there,
I am very confused with several things in statistics column. I couldn't find any specific criteria for this section. Let me clear one by one easing to answer

1. Month/Year of statistics
Which month the stats should start?? In metro airports like BLR, MAA, HYD and CCU, it is mentioned from April 2010 - March 2011. But in DEL and BOM, month is not mentioned.
When to update these stats?? Monthly or Yearly?? In above mentioned airports, it is still until March 2011. Lets say if it is monthly, how to do after one financial year?? In first month, April only and in next month, April - May??
May be this is silly question, but just to clarify. What phrase we should use for Month/Year. I found several methods. They are April 2011, Apr 2011, April '11, Apr ' 11. Which is better to maintain a standard format for all airports in India??",0
"I am certain that it is wrong to say categorically, without detailing what one means when one says that biodiesel is non-toxic. Even apart from the fact that you are generalising on several items: mode, temperature, duration of exposure, plus even more pertinent: on source of oil (what plant it is coming from, and which part of it) and whether it is a methyl ester or ethyl ester. In my view it is irresponsible to say categorically that biodiesel is non-toxic.  If you insist then you can sign on the bottom line, if anyone comes to harm from biodiesel of any source and in any application you'll take the responsibility, but I don't think that you would be foolish enough to do that.

As an example: The toxicity of erucic acid (see WP under that title) a component of some canola oils and several others is a contentiou issue. Canola (rapeseed) oil is classed as high, medium and low eruc canola oil and only the low erucic acid canola oil is accepted universally for human consumption.

If you study a textbook on vegetable oils and fats you will find that the composition of an oil can depend on which part of the plant it is coming from.

Another example of the danger of generalisation: Is rhubarb toxic ? Its roots are not, but the leafs are deadly. So if you insist on leaving the statement in, then please say what you mean exactly (which biodiesel, when and how)    

  

Another ex 

The way that this statement has come about (at least two decades ago) is by somebody who wanted to flog the idea of ester fuels, and then it was repeated without thinking.",0

The citizens screaming and calling for justice may not be speaking for the population as a whole; but they are the ones that make the news.  I think before you guys make opinions based on what the media tells you; you should find out if the average tribal member agrees with Russel Means or Leonard Peltier.  You should also research how much time they actually spent on the reservation.  Again I am no expert but from what I know growing up here is that AIM and many others like them were extreme liberals that were not necessarily speaking for the society at large.

 Temple of Diana 

Quote from """"Pre-Norman cathedral"""" section: """"Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the cathedral had been built on the site of a temple dedicated to the goddess Diana, in alignment with the Apollo temple that he imagined once stood at Westminster..."""".

Nonsense - Geoffrey did NOT make such a claim. The idea that (following the persecution of Christians by Diocletian) Apollo was worshipped at Westminster and Diana in London comes from the history of Westminster Abbey by John Flete, 15th-century monk of Westminster - and he didn't say that Diana was worshipped on the site of St Paul's. That comes from William Camden's Britannia, published in 1586. Camden puts forward the theory that a Roman Temple of Diana had once stood on the site of St Paul's. His evidence is not accepted by modern archaeologists. 

And if the """"in alignment with"""" phrase actually means what it says, one can only respond that a straight line can indeed be drawn between any two points!

Since the sentence about Geoffrey of Monmouth is unreferenced and unverifiable (as well as untrue) I'm simply going to delete it pro tem - unless someone can provide the essential reference to a verifiable source. However, since the """"Temple of Diana"""" story still resurfaces occasionally (along with the """"megalithic stone circle""""!) it will be worth reintroducing it at some point, correctly attributed and with proper references.  -   """,0

@""""There is no way on earth it was a historical country."""" Yes, well, try telling that to . Frankly, I don't know what his current views are, or whether he's stopped pushing that recently, but I know I've been trying to hammer that point for months over there. For some reason, I honestly cannot fathom why, he's attached to presenting General Nedic's Government of National Salvation as a WWII Serbian state (see this version, for example).

Tomasevich and Ramet, as I recall, are both very clear on the issue:

@""""Do you have any suggestions as to an alternative article title?"""" There's the problem. Notice the wording of the current """"compromise title"""": Serbia under German occupation. What """"Serbia"""" was it that was under occupation? As I said above, there was no """"Serbia"""" since 1918, and the Federal State of Serbia was only de facto established after the liberation of the territory in question (with the establishment of the ASNOS on 12 November 1944 in newly-liberated Belgrade). It does not even geographically correspond with post-war Serbia (as it is significantly smaller).

The whole situation over there is a mess born out of compromise. We essentially have only two organizations in the area: the Military Administration in Serbia, and its subordinate Government of National Salvation. As far as I'm concerned, its perfectly fine whether we decide to cover them as one article (entitled """"Military Administration in Serbia""""), or if the Government of National Salvation gets its own article. What we do not need is this weird article entitled as if it covers an entirely imaginary occupied country. The point is that the official, real name of the territory was """"Military Administration in Serbia"""". A situation perfectly analogous with all the other five Military Administrations.

As I said, the situation is confused by the fact that """"Serbia"""" is apparently the nickname for the """"Military Administration in Serbia"""" (i.e. the territory known under that occupation """"designation""""). Look at Tomasevich. He says """"the Puppet Government of Serbia"""", suggesting (to a person who did not actually read the text) that this """"Serbia"""" was some sort of puppet country. Even though it is perfectly obvious, as you say, that there was no such historical country. Enter PANONIAN, proclaiming that Tomasevich supports him in the claim that there was a country called """"Serbia"""", and that the Government of National Salvation was only the government thereof. And then here comes General Nedic with some coins he issued with the name """"Serbia"""", and presto - a new historical country.   (talk) """,0

I am also a little puzzled by your reading of nine or ten identical frat-boy beer belches as a """"commendable"""" effort to """"keep things light.""""  We all have different sensibilities, and you're certainly entitled to yours.  But be aware that here is my attempt to keep things light in the face of obstructionism.  Note that in this case there is a point to the playfulness: the weight, authority, influence, and reliability of sources is not – contra Jayjg – a function of their print run.  Jay's response to this lightness was to say, again and again, that I had """"strawmanned"""" him (while steadfastly refusing to clarify his point or show how I'd distorted it), then to attack me directly and personally and say I've never in the past shown the """"grace or honesty to admit"""" when I've lied about such matters, and so was unlikely to admit my deceptions in this instance.  And then began the beer-belching frat-boy hazing extravaganza you found so commendably charming.

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

 Temporary massive removal of some legendary history 

There were quite a few paragraphs discussing the ancient origins of the Yadavs, but as I was picking my way through it, it appeared a well-nigh impenetrable mass of confusing data, and likely a lot of WP:Synthesis. Terms such as Yadava/Yadav, Ahir/Yadav, and Abhira/Ahir were frequently conflated, and it appeared at many (most?) times that info was included without regard for whether the cited author gave any indication that his topic involved the modern Yadav caste. The info is not """"lost"""", it is cleanly preserved in the History tab, and its removal noted in Edit Summary and here so that any inclined editor can go back through it and carefully select the appropriate portions to re-incorporate. I submit that any info not specifically related to the modern Yadav go into the appropriate other articles such as Yadava and Abhira, etc. and that only material clearly linking the modern Yadavs to those ancient roots be included here. Otherwise, lengthy explanations of past groups with no clear link to the present group constitutes Synthesis, as it implies/pre-supposes a factual linkage when one may not be specified.

Again, I'm not trying to permanently wipe out this info, I just think the section was very unwieldy and contentious, and rather than pick and chip at it, it's better to temporarily wipe the slate clean, and then mine the past drafts to incorporate any usable data.   """,0
"""::Respectable guide books (in their printed versions) mostly count as reliable sources, and, interestingly, most such respectable guide books are very uncomplimentary about Gibraltar as a tourist destination. (In comparison to the lovely areas of the Spanish coast to the west of Gibraltar.) If there really are concerns about the Gibraltar government's off-hand comments about not wanting """"nasty"""" material added - which seemed quite innocent and unremarkable to me - then the concerned people should spend some time adding neutral and due weight content from guide books to some of the Gibraltar-related article. I somehow doubt there will be mass reverting of such additions, which will helpfully show that we're still getting neutral and encyclopedic content.

If all of this brings us to a point where detailed summaries of such respected guide books can be easily accessed through Wikipedia when visiting Andalucia, that would be a huge benefit to people like me. So get to it!

Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.

 Symptoms 
 Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others
 Assumes bad faith frequently
 TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA)
 Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about """"writing the encyclopedia""""
 Impatience
 Exhibits immediatism
 Hangs out in project namespace
 Has no time for featured articles
 Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted
 Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...)
 Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life
 Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll
 Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons
 Seems to enjoy biting new users
 General BOFHness
 Strict adherence to """"Wikipedia policy"""" while not using common sense or conversely,
 Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense
 Self-denial. """"This page cannot possibly apply to me""""
 Humor breakdown. """"This page is not funny""""
 Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before
 Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person
 Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior
 Believes he is the only real claimant to the """"Defender of the Wiki"""" barnstar
 Exhibits signs of MPOV
 Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice
 Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack
 Indulges in biting delicious newcomers

 Diagnosis 
It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness: 

 You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!).
 """"Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked"""" is a recurrent thought.
 """"Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)"""" is a mantra, not anti-wiki. 
 If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis.
 Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis.
 If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected. 
 And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.

 Pathophysiology 
The infectious nature of this illness is unknown at this time.  More study needs to be conducted in order to identify transmission mechanisms. No effective containment mechanisms have been identified. So far anti-vandal bots have proved immune to this condition, although as yet there is no convincing explanation concerning this anomaly. 

Observational studies have noted that sufferers will seek the counsel of their Wikipedia friends, but end up infecting them in the process. Other studies have noted the evolution of a Wikipedia editor as potentially having a causal role in this illness.

Proposal for a revised introduction

Okay, I have a proposal for a new intro which needs to be worked on more, but I wanted to put what I have so far out there (I'm not at all wild about the specific wording at points, but I think you'll get the drift).  The intro has been the victim of a lot of reversions, and I think it would be good for us to get that straight.  Right now there is no criticism of Chomsky's position on Nicaragua v. United States in the intro (actually Ultramarine appears to have added it back, but I have a different version) and I think there obviously should be.  I've also added some new stuff.  Here it is, and I'll try to explain what I was trying to do and what I think is missing after the proposed text. The first two sentences are the same (including sources) though I have removed some italics which seemed unnecessary.

The United States of America has been accused of funding, training, and harboring individuals and groups who engage in terrorism by some legal scholars, other governments, and human rights organizations, among others. Linguist and U.S. foreign policy critic Noam Chomsky argues that the U.S. has been legally found guilty of international terrorism based on the verdict by the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. United States, which condemned the United States federal government not for terrorism per se, but for its """"unlawful use of force"""".{{cite web

Hello there, me old fruit!

It is true that it's getting harder for me with having to put in ten edits before I can use my accounts. They sometimes get spotted and blocked whilst I'm making the ten edits, especially if I've just used an account and especially if User:Hut 8.5's online. I have generally targeted a dormant user talk page or tagged my own sockpuppets to achieve the ten edits.

It is not too difficult yet. User:Raul654 has put in loads of IP rangeblocks which do restrict me. I can generally get on using BT.

There seems to be a concerted effort now by many different users to revert my edits quickly. I suppose a good measure of my effectiveness is the percentage of the time that my edits are visible, or whether the page is fully protected. That percentage is very low at the moment. VICS is fully protected, but Northwich Victoria F.C. and Witton Albion F.C. are not.

It is worth the effort; I still hate the whole Wikipedia concept of truth by consensus. I can cope with being reverted within minutes by many different editors, being checkusered regularly and blocked on sight. User:Raul654's checkuser investigations are only about 95 - 98% accurate in terms of percentage of accounts that he labels actually being me.

 Spider Loc & Young Buck controversy 
Hey boss, what is the issue you have with the Spider Loc and Young Buck controversy that you keep deleting the entire paragraph after numerous users have updated and added content to it? Are you not recognizing the beef as factual? Check out Spider Loc's homepage or MySpace page or any one of a thousand websites (including MTV) that have covered the controversy.

In effect, it should be treated no differently than as if Peiser himself (or any other scientist) had verbally relayed the conclusions directly to a reporter.

 Thank you for the assistance, really helps ) But in regards to the pages, you may be able to help me with a couple of questions. I know the songs by Kylie that I made have not charted, won an award, or have been covered by any artists as stated by WP:NSONGS, there are a selection of songs I found on Wikipedia by really famous artists that kinda sits on the same boat as these articles. For example, articles Superpower (song), Rocket (Beyoncé song) and Rocket (Beyoncé song) by American singer Beyonce are well cover just like my articles but have not charted, won an award or have been covered by a variety of artists as stated by the criteria (maybe the music video significance allows it on the site?), alongside Who Am I Living For? by American singer Katy Perry. Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like """"Too Far"""" and """"I Don't Need Anyone"""" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single. Also, the WP:NSONGS does say that those three criterias do not have to been needed but are afromented to. I'm not trying to make excuses, that is not my intention, but maybe you can help me out on this factor so I can have a clearer idea and mind on what I can do and cannot do with song/album articles.

 It's amazing the amount of ignorance concerning Martin Luther. Early in his life he was a stalwart defender of the Jews, saying 

""""We ought...not to treat the Jews in so unkindly a spirit,""""-Luther, Magnificat, 21:354f. 

and 

""""Absurd theologians defend hatred for the Jews. ... What Jew would consent to enter our ranks when he sees the cruelty and enmity we wreak on them—that in our behavior towards them we less resemble Christians than beasts?""""-Luther quoted in Elliot Rosenberg, But Were They Good for the Jews? (New York: Birch Lane Press, 1997), p.65.

What people fail to put together is that Luther suffered a tremendous decline in health in his old age (Iversen OH (1996). """"[Martin Luther's somatic diseases. A short life-history 450 years after his death]"""" (in Norwegian). Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 116 (30): 3643–46.) and decayed into senility. It was in this state that he challenged the canonicity of the Book of James and even recanted his faith on his death-bed. He lost his mind in his old age. Medicine had simply failed to progress to the point where they could diagnose it at that point in history. His later comments should not be privileged any more than the average institutionalized individual. It's very sad that people who wish to defame Luther take such a narrow-minded view of his illness and comments in order to discredit him. Truly it was a tragedy that such a great man was so utterly destroyed by illness.

 From the Members
Welcome to the sixth edition of the WikiProject Eurvision newsletter! 

It's been a busy few months for me at school so I am going to need a lot more participation from the WikiProject in organizing this newsletter each month. It's not an easy task. The best way to help would be to submit anything you feel should be on the next newsletter here so that when I want to make it, I have all of the information ready to go. Also, by doing it this way, there is more information that you want to know as opposed to what I felt was important.

National final season is now in full swing and participants and songs are being chosen every week. For the most part, we are doing a great job in keeping all of the pages up to date, but I urge veteran editors to help out the new people as they tend to not know how everything should be",0

"""
 Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.
 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )""",0

OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

"MSU Interview 

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

Question
Hey, ! I saw that you were an administrator here, so I was just wondering if you might be able to answer a question I had. The thing is, I'm an admin on a different wiki, and another admin on the same wiki posted a question to the rest of the admins asking if there was a URL that can be used to show any user their current number of edits on the wiki. On our wiki, there's a page called Special:Editcount that conveys that information (I don't think Wikipedia has a page like this though), so another admin advised him to use this URL: http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/Username. That URL would achieve the desired result, but one would have to constantly put the username of the specific user at the end of the URL when posting it on that user's talk page, so my goal was to come up with a way to avoid that; almost to create something you could post on any user's talk page without changing any part of it and still get the desired result. I came up with this: {{fullurl:Special:Editcount/{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}, this way, one could just post the coding on the talk page of the desired user and the returned URL would automatically direct the user to their respective edit count. This worked successfully for every other user whose talk page I tested the coding on (without saving the page, of course); the only problem is that the user he wanted to do this for has an """"*"""" both at the beginning and the end of their username (the second asterisk isn't a problem, just the first), meaning that instead of being returned as:

it gets returned as:

{{fullurl:Special:Editcount/

User*}}

and doesn't take anyone anywhere, because it's just the raw coding. So I was just wondering if you knew of any way to circumvent this problem (aside from just telling him to post """"http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/*User*"""" on the user's talk page, which isn't the end of the world, but is, of course, what I was trying to get around in the first place), maybe by putting some other form of coding that I'm not aware of somewhere in the existing coding or something. Any light you may be able to shed on this problem would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

"""A column that elaborates on how the filesystem handles tiny file data (of a few bytes, like 5) would be nice.

This is called tail packing  
And block suballocation, which is a similar concept. I am unsure about file systems that keep short files with the directory or inode entry. I've heard something vague about NTFS keeping short files in the MFT; if this is true, it indeed isn't represented right now.   
This is correct. Tail packing and suballocation put multiple files into one block, but that is still discontigous from any other related information, like the inode block or directory listing. By contrast, NTFS stores data for *very* short (I don't have an exact number, but it's in the several hundred bytes region) files in the directory listing, which entirely eliminates a seek for the data. Perhaps a note of this fact in a footnote for the """"partial"""" suballocation support?

Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is """"Mary Lou""""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  """,0

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article.

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0

 A tag has been placed on Thomas Dworzak requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Someone placed a link to the prior article, which has been archived off Wikipedia, and is no longer Wikipedia's responsibility, in the current article.  Since this is a hot news story, and the new version of the article is a stub, I see nothing wrong with giving people a link to the old version while the new one is rewritten, so they at least have something to read.  Justin is of course welcome to complain to anyone hosting the old article, but as you know, trying such things on the Internet just makes more people replicate the information on their sites, and is a fruitless exercise.

As I said earlier I respect the victim. Maybe you didn't read my earlier comments in this section. But it doesn't matter whether you or I respect the victim. Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion and I have stated this fact again and again. It is one of the main policies of Wikipedia. Besides can I ask how is keeping her name a secret going to protect her dignity. It is not the victims but criminals who hide their names. The girl had done nothing wrong but wrong was done to her. Why should her name be kept secret? People should know who that girl was. Revealing her name will be true respect to her. This was the same thing her father said too and you think that by hiding her name you are respecting her. No you are doing the total opposite.Not only that her name is completely verifable. Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion but still revealing her name will inspire people. People made a publicity of her death and you say I'm the one disrespecting her. Looks it's easy to blame those weaker than you. If you really respected her you would have said that those who made her death a publicity event were the ones who didn't respect her. Tell me can you say to a political leader who is using her name for political agenda. Of course not because he's way more powerful than you. It's easier to blame the weak and tell them.they're doing the right thing but we can.never do that to those more powerful than us. Think again before saying that I don't respect her. Her father and I share the same opinion that revealing her identity will be true respect to her. Tell me will you say that her father does not respect her?,0

"History of Palestine national football team
We should show both viewpoints and matches claimed to be the first internationals played by Palestine or Israel in 1934 and 1953 if we want to be righteous and give a civilized image for Wikipedia. Note that the British mandate used the term Palestine predominately (not Israel).

I as a Palestinian try and wants to be neutral as much as I can, however when it comes to stealing my country's sport history, I became very angry and I feel injustice. According to many sources, a part of them says that Palestine came to existence in football for the first in 1928 and played vs Egypt in the World Cup Qualification, and the other part says that the Palestinian Football Association was inherited by the Israeli one in 1948.

"""is a matter of people editing your contributions. Otherwise, why would you edit-war in order to include content that violates the rules (more particularly about OR) and that happens to be written by you ? A lot of OR has already been removed many times from many articles by many editors, including me. However you created conflicts only when your contributions were concerned, because you just cannot accept the idea that your holy edits wouldn't stay on WP. 
I'm not reverting """"any change made by anyone"""", I am removing content that has nothing to do on Wikipedia, such as unsourced opinions and original research. Each time I'm removing something, it is always perfectly justified according to the WP policies and guidelines. However, each time you start an edit war, you're just unable to find anything to substanciate it, other than personal attacks. By the way, contributing to an article in any way, either by actually writing quality content (ie content that meet the requirements from various policies) or by removing the content that doesn't correspond to the WP standards, is work. So yes, I have worked on Eva articles. 
So, you are the hothead who throws childish trantrums each time someone """"dares"""" to touch your Holy Writings, and who yell at me instead of trying to discuss with civility and to actually try to justify your edits. 
Concerning your nonesense about """"authority"""", as Dandy Sephy reminded you, """"consensus isn't require to write things, and things being changed is what wikipedia is about"""". 
Moreover, there is no need of consensus to remove obvious policy violations either (such as original research, unsourced opinions, etc. That is, everything I have removed from your contribs). 
On the contrary, as it is stated in WP:V, """"Any material lacking a reliable source may be removed"""". I know very well what the next part of the sentence recommands, but it only highlights the fact that there is no need of discussion, only that the editor wanting to re-include the content has the duty to find a source, and not endlessly argue that editors should be allowed to write unsourced OR.
There is also the Jimmy Wales quote: """"I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced.""""
So if you're not ready to accept that anyone can remove your edits, you should not contribute.
What you're saying is indeed utter nonesense. Nowhere in WP is it stated that I would need your approval before removing your contribs (whether I'd just be wanting to replace them with something entirely different, or they'd be blatant policy violations), and indeed Wikipedia is not going to tolerate policy violations just so that some contributors could maintain their grasps on articles and their pride. When I remove content, it is always according to the most basic rules of WP so there's no discussing it. It is not authority, it is applying the rules of WP, and I can't see why they wouldn't apply to you.
By the way, you're reproaching me a so-called """"authority"""", but it doesn't seem to bother you to reinsert your content back into the article without any discussion of without any justification concerning the various policies and guidelines. You should not give lessons about authority in these circumstances.
In conclusion, your multiple and failed attempts at article ownership have only slowed down improvements, as your silly argument is doing now. You'd better either start showing you can write the actual quality content that you're boasting about, or stop whining.  

So everything you're saying is utter nonesense.

I do not mean to contend that the definition isn't open to debate, but only that its openness to debate isn't tied in any direct way to whether it is a """"social contruction"""".  In the first case, consider the terms """"integer"""" and """"one"""": both terms where surely created by agents in a social setting, yet their definitions are particularly rigorous.  As for the second case, i might say that a man is jewish just in case his mother were jewish. """"Jew"""" in this sense is a social construction, it is purely social convention and not a natural kind in any ordinary way.  Nonetheless, we already stipulated a perfectly rigourous definition.            -J""",0

 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",0

"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.  

And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic. Well, I counter your source with mine.  Source.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Did you really read what I wrote?  It doesn't matter if they're emo or not.  We're not using C&C; as an example of an emo band, we're using C&C; as an example of a band that's been called emo.  They've been called emo, so they're mentioned.  Period.

(BTW - click on the """"tag"""" page of your """"source"""".)  

Honestly, I read it. But I don't give a damn what you wrote. Apparently you are one of those """"I must be right, or heaven shall fall"""" type of people. But, yet again. So you're making your own rules for Wikipedia now? You know, the public place? ....Cute.

But, as always there is that one prick in the crowd. You know what though, KoRn sings about sad matters, about how they are lonely and scared little boys and no one gets them.

I also take massive issue with the translation. Even ignoring the fact that for absolutely no reason whatsoever, it just leaves large passages untranslated, some of it is just a clear sign of incompetence. """"Fenians of Fál""""? No. Just, no. Anyone with a basic familiarity with the Irish language in a modern context will be able to tell you that """"Fianna Fáil"""" means """"soldiers of destiny"""" - fáil being the genitive of fál, destiny, and fianna the plural of fiann, soldier, much as in """"Amhrán na bhFiann"""", the soldiers' song, and Lia Fáil, the rock of destiny. It's the name of a party, for God's sake, and the article about that party also confirms it means """"soldiers of destiny"""": Fianna Fáil. The Fenians were a minor Republican group, and """"Fál"""" isn't even an English word...I'm sorry, but the sources – as I'm sure other speakers of the language, native or otherwise, will be able to confirm – are just wrong.

I continue to have problems with LGagnon at Wikipedia. He sends me the most ill-written messages. It is almost impossible to wade through the bad grammar, misspellings/typos; etc to get his point. He indulges the most foul personal attacks with regard to everyone, even Wikipedia admins, referring to the latter as """"vandal-coddling."""" He never backs up his unthinking assertions. He simply asserts.

Why does Wikipedia continue to indulge one  but one  lamentably under-educated vulgarian in this regard, to this degree? What could possibly be the explanation????!!!!!!!!

In other words, you are asking if you and your cronies were unsuccessful at shutting down the discussion of the issue, on a different page (EURO), in part by employment of your ham-handed authority to shut me down for a few days, which you did 6 months ago.  No, you were not successful.  In part, this was also due to the fact that your cronies failed to actually address the issue:  They were apparently so enamored at their power to call you in to abuse your authority, they didn't find it necessary to actually present winning arguments...you know, DEBATE.  You, yourself, were unwilling or unable to participate in the debate, too.  But that means that there is no basis at all to allow you to give your input, in any way, into this matter.  You must admit to these people that you really weren't interested in the subject, you were just brought in to be a thug, a torpedo, to shut down the debate.

That may well all be true (isn't Perseus at Tuft's though not Harvard? - not that I really know much about its origins) but what particularly bothered me is that there are no citations for any of this outside of Landow himself and his immediate circle.  I don't mean to be spying around and know nothing about your personal relationship but I clicked on your website and saw in 10 seconds that it says right at the top """"neo victorian computing"""" which sounds like Landow in a nutshell and suggests to me some sort of connection.  Browsing the pages for Jackson and Manovich they were noticeably more diverse and feel rather more like proper wikipedia pages citing different sources and with input obviously derived from different people.  Sure Coover and Landow are colleagues at Brown, but you could say the same for hundreds of other people, it doesn't change the fact that Coover is one of the US's better known contemporary novelists and Landow is, well, not.  If you turn to other academic departments at a university like Brown, I imagine you'll find faculty members, departmental chairs, and so on, more influential than Landow in their respective fields but with no little """"who's who"""" wikipedia write-ups to show for it.  But I suppose I'm being petty and it shouldn't be a surprise that people who basically study wikipedia should have their own pages on it.  The same probably goes for bloggers etc..

"""

 A simple suggestion 

Instead of contextualizing paragraph two by books of """"The Bible,"""" which implies a later, Christian source, the more relevant words """"Hebrew Bible"""" or """"Tanakh"""" (or both) ought to be the terms of definition.  Otherwise, one might start to think that """"Old Testament"""" translations, based upon the Greek Septaguint, are the authorities when in fact the Masoretic text of the Tanakh is considered by Jews the obvious standard.  

The term 'Bible' does not at all imply a later Christian source. It is a widely used term for the books considered canonical by Christians, that is not to say that they have a Christian origin. It is also a misunderstanding that translations based on the Septuagint are authoritative for Christians. Nearly all English Bible translations are in fact based on the Masoretic text. Only in Eastern Orthodox streams of Christianity is the Septuagint the standard Bible. In any case, apart from a few fringe groups, Christians realize that the authority of any translation ultimately goes back to the original Hebrew (i.e. for the books of the Bible originally written in Hebrew of course).    

Failure to contextualize

The """"Construction"""" section's 7th paragraph begins """"In 1967 Israel captured Old Jerusalem (and the Temple Mount) from Jordan.""""  No other information is given about this; the impression is that Israel invaded Jordan without provocation, when in fact Israel's actions in the 1967 war were in response to a mass attack upon her by Arab countries, including Jordan, after Egypt's General Nasser and the other Arab States allied with Egypt had engaged in an act of war by closing down Israel's ability to ship through the Straits of Tiran with the express and stated purpose of annihilating Israel.  This false impression must be corrected if it is to avoid being unintentionally anti-Semitic.   

Having a bias against Israel is not the same as being anti-Semitic. Also, I think the current statement is simply concise, not going deep into the political situation because this is not the topic of the article. However, if you feel contextualizing is necessary, just go ahead. Remember Wikipedia's policy to be bold.    """,0
"""

 First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official """"executioner"""".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that """"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner"""", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.

 Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:
 """"Balance
 Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."""", etc. 

 Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about """"El Che"""", to see if all viewoints are represented:
  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)
 (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)
 (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)
 (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)
 (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)
 (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)
 It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the """"insignificant"""" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes """"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article"""" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  
 
 Third. I've been following the WP:Ignore all rules rule, mentioned by  in a prominent location in his user page, toward the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important ones in this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help to tell me about it). I will come back, promise. Regards,   """,0

They were arrested for protesting in a place and time there was a ban on protesting. It doesn't matter if they were protesting Zwarte Piet, racism or to save puppies Cruella de Ville: they were arrested for breaking the law. Just like you are doing now, they are playing the victim to turn this whole thing into a """"look at the evil racist white devil"""" story, but on Wikipedia we are supposed to stick to the facts.
FACT is that in the Netherlands there are limits to when and where people are allowed to protest. This goes for neo Nazi's as much as for Zwarte Piet protesters. No source has been provided to support the claim that the reason for the arrest was anything other than breaking the protesting law.
FACT is that a Wikipedia editor claiming """"Police reports a BS"""" needs some good evidence. Founding an entry in an article on a baseless accusation like that, we might as well turn the 9/11 page into the truth as claimed by the conspirators.
FACT is that none of the sources quoted support the claim based on first-hand reports.

It was 89.57. You rounded up. I love how have to type sentence after sentence about a subject you clearly know nothing about. It was a 27.3 m (89.5 ft) female caught off the South Shetland Islands in January 1925. Whether it was measured or not I can't say. It wasn't measured by a scientist in the standard zoological manner (in a straight line from the tip of the rostrum to the notch of the flukes) though, so it probably wasn't measured accurately (if at all). It was most likely measured alongside a factory ship during flensing (unless it was taken to the Deception Island station). This was just before the widespread use of stern slipways, so it would have been difficult to measure if it indeed was. The cited source should be Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929), which cite Risting (1928), which I don't have access to. Mackintosh and Wheeler simply say it was """"27.3 m. or 89 ft. 6 in."""" (p. 321).

I believe that if there are serious questions regarding this matter, the better place for such discussion would probably be at the WP:RSN or WP:NPOVN, and also perhaps contact editors at WP:LAW or any editors with legal expertise to see if the possible flaw in the above logic is a real flaw.

""":This is not original research, it is just presentation of the actual data used by Rodgers in his research, abstracted directly from his paper, from an earlier paper by Petty which Rodgers is re-analysing in his paper, and from a US National Safety Council report which Rodgers cites. However, from these data one can assess what importance should be attached to the Rodgers study. After reading the Rodgers paper and assembling the data he used, it became clear that quoting one sentence from Rodgers' conclusion overstated what could validly be drawn from the Rodgers analysis of the data shown above. The following text would be an acceptable compromise:
 """"Rodgers analysed annual (1973 to 1987) national time-series estimates of cycling injuries, annual counts of cycling and pedestrian road accident fatalities, estimates of bicycle use and bicycle standards compliance, and estimates of helmet use based on sales of one particular brand of (now obsolete) hard-shell helmet. After fitting a linear regression model to these data he concluded that: """"There is no evidence that hard shell helmets have reduced the head injury and fatality rates. The most surprising finding is that the bicycle-related fatality rate is positively and significantly correlated with increased helmet use"""".

Should The Great Khali be on ON Air Talent because right now, he has just been a bodyguard for Daivari and hasnt wrestled yet.

idk if anyone has mentioned him, but isnt Marty Jannetty supposed to appear on the ECW brand(hes inactive now)? i know there were rumors saying he was released shortly after being signed, but he said they were untrue and WWE hasnt officially cut ties with him, at least publicly.

And if Jannetty is left off, then i think Gangrel should be true. rumors said he was overweight and WWE was considering not using him

Angel Williams has been called up to valet the Gymini. she did so for a dark match, should she be called up to SD! yet?

Lastly, shouldnt Eric Bischoff be on On Air Talent for RAW? the Cyber Sunday thing seemed like a one time deal to promote the book, but it could develop into a storyline after he screwed DX.

The Ottoman census reflects only the religuious adherence of the population and nothing else

Exactly. So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth? Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but neither you nor me are in position to decide that. This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail, without deciding which is right and which is wrong, and that my friend is what we call neutrality. You might as well try and take a hint. Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking. The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople. You're confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic-speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time. Therefore despite religion and language, the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek (or Roman if you prefer). Then if we can't trust any demography, think of the population exchanges. 50,000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia, and some 60,000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria. Then some 500,000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly, we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia? Where did the other half million come from? Mars? Oh, I know, it's a Bulgarian """"majority"""" group that the Greek government is still hiding isn't that so? And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you're trying to pass as the truth: 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south. I mean, use your brain for ones and do the maths - have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today? Honestly some people just can't take the truth. And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco-Serbian alliance. Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek? Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic-speaking lands to assimilate. It would have never happened. If you really want to do something to help your country, I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help. I don't think that making nationalist propaganda of the internet is one of their priorities at the moment.

How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community. This will be more sources, more reliable and athenticated rather called Biased and may be reverted repeatedly.

Hi Star Mississippi,

We created a great new social network site www.homestayonline.com for homestay enthusiasts. It is the first of its kind in terms of technology features and more including online chat, groups, forums, and more... I think that it is the first of its kind in homestay. I launched on April 9th and so far we have 40 members. I tried to add it a resource page to Wikipedia homestay subject but it was removed. I may have used the wrong method to add it and I apologize but if very tiresome to try again. I wonder if you can help me do right thing or add it for me in the most appropriate manner. I also hope that it would stay, since the HomestayOnline network is expected goal is to grow by minimum 50 members per day by end of 2009.

I would appreciate if you can also log-in my site and see for yourself how this can help everyone. It is free of charge to join...

Let me know!

 Polyspermy 

Before you revert the stable version - please discuss this first on the talk page. As for your question:
Look at the beginning of the third line. The Talmud quotes the verse from 1 Samuel 17, 4, which goes as follows: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines"""", right? Now, look at your Bible - ibid., and see the full verse: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath..."""". Right?
So, the Talmud quotes the verse about Goliath, and then: interprates this verse - using a pun - in the following way (see the Talmud ibid. in that third line): """"One hundred foreskins of Philistines - got her [i.e. his mother] pregnant"""". In other words: the Talmud explains, that the biblical words """"And there went out a champion"""" - mean:  """"And there was created/born a champion"""", and it also explains that the biblical words: """"out of the camp of the Philistines"""", mean: """"out of a hundred foreskins of Philistines"""". Note that this fantastic interpretaion made by the Talmud - is based on a pun: the word for """"camp"""" is similar to (i.e. sounds like) """"a hundred foreskins"""" (not in English of course). Note also that fantastic interpretaions for the Bible - are very common in the Talmud.
Now, look ibid. at the next line (i.e. the fourth line); The Talmud now explains how - having so many fathers - is really possible from a biological point of view, so the Talmud continues: """"Rav Matania said: no controversy over that; as long as the sperm [of the first man] hasn't gotten rotten [in the woman's body] yet, a woman can get pregnant by two men - all at once"""".
Notice that all of the Talmud's commentators explain all of this - as I did.
Hope this helps. Anyway, next time, please consult pefore you revert the stable version.

"While it may be true that there are thousands of trolls for Richard Kastle and Lang Lang... there is a huge difference. Although Lang Lang does (visually) look like an idiot when he performs with his weird facial expressions and over exaggerated face... he still happens to be a brilliant pianist (in the pieces where he doesn't decide to go 10 times the speed as directed.) 

Richard Kastle however as far as I (or many other people have tried) know has never had a single CD published or recorded. The fact that on the entirety of YouTube there is about 30 seconds of actual footage of Richard Kastle playing and a still shot of him on a Jay Leno show. 

Many of the so called 'trolls' that abuse Richard Kastle have a right to do so, due to the fact that a couple of psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time are truly wrong. There is also video footage on YouTube of a guy (who I believe is Kastle) discrediting major pianists such as Horowitz and Cziffra because they 'supposedly' simplified parts of their repertoire. This is completely NOT true due to the fact that University Professionals and other Professional Pianists would easily have picked up such a disregard for the music, in seconds. 

This article on Richard Kastle should be deleted due to the fact that it is just another excuse for one of those psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time, to brag about a man who does not deserve the credit he deserves. If it IS true that Kastle did actually discredit the great pianists - this page should be taken down for praising a slander who has the audacity to verbally abuse the good name and brilliant talent of the pianists who are deceased and have no way of discrediting this so called fraud called 'Richard Kastle'.

"""lol. Regardless of intent or accident - I actually wish that GoingBatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that I'm working on. GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course.

 One Corpse Too Many  vandalism of reference's url 

Thanks for all your changes to spelling, date formats, use of dashes, etc in this entry.  I did not appreciate that you randomly altered part of the long string that is the url for Ref 8 in the article.  I have fixed it now, so the link goes directly to the google book of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica article on Shrewsbury Castle, on page 1022.  Please leave that unchanged.

I do not understand why you are undoing links to the 'year in literature' articles, and to the 'year in British television' articles.  It took me time to get each book in its proper year, and to make sure the television adaptations were correctly described as to series, episode and year, and matching that overall page as well as IMDb information.  Not every novel was adapted for television. So I put those links back, for consistency across The Cadfael Chronicles articles in Wikipedia, the 20 novels and one short story collection.  

Is this some new rule in Wikipedia, though the articles for the year in literature and year in television still exist?

Sorry, I was referring mainly to the INTRO not the rest of the article.

the two main popular opposing views of Saddam: as a brutal dictator, regional threat of WMD and terrorism, vs. freedom fighter / modern Sallah a-Din whatever his supporters want to call it.

Safi is from Iran, where images of the Prophet are tolerated.

So I should stop replying to you and let you get the last word here on your talk page. However, you did state """"For some of the claims, there are evidence, but others, there are not."""" So that's a start to  you seemingly acknowledging your belief that there is some valid evidence for the material you dispute.  

The text doesn't state that """"men [don't know] how to."""" It states something that Kinsey concluded, and it is clearly attributed to Kinsey  """"Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do."""" We are allowed to mention researchers' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It's also what I just stated above: """"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying."""" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that """"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship."""" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   

The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. 

We don't have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn't mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The """"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact"""" line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that """"many other sources"""" show the opposite of the material you kept removing. If there were many other sources of such nature, you'd be able to present one other than the Schwartz study, which is not an opposing study (as in a study directly going against what the studies in the article have found).

"BringIt

BringIt is a video gaming website that provides “gamers” the opportunity to connect over the internet and play one on one or multi-player tournaments against each other for money. The site was launched in November 2008 by Woodrow Levin.

In addition to the gaming provided, the website allows users to blog, create profiles and write reviews in the forums.  BringIt includes the following platforms: XBOX 360, PS2, PS3 and Wii.  The main page also provides gamers with a list of the games the website supports.

BringIt’s main page allows auto matches or allows gamers to select an opponent who is looking to play a specific game for the same dollar amount.  Players identify each other by their “gaming tag”, an online ID, and utilize their console’s online multiplayer platform or the built in multiplayer function of the game to play each other. When the game is completed, both players report the outcome to the website, or in the alternative result, emails are automatically reported from the game’s End of Game Email Reporting System. Winning players then have their account credited.  

Founder/Chief Executive Officer

Woodrow H. Levin founded InStadium and Riverbank Capital Management. Woodrow has been featured in Media Life Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, and has been a guest speaker at the University Of Wisconsin School Of Business. Woodrow received his B.A. in Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Juris Doctor from the Chicago-Kent School of Law. Woodrow is active in community and charitable organizations including JUF, Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation and most recently was on the executive committee of The Chicago Green Tie Ball.

How BringIt Works

All new gaming consoles and many older consoles are able to connect to the internet for multiplayer online game play. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo game consoles all have built in software which allows owners to play online against other gamers anywhere in the world. Each game will then be played through the existing technology of the console or game maker. 

Our Mission

BringIt is an online community where gamers across the globe can play video games for real money.  BringIt is a community of American and International gamers with the ability to play against each other 24 hours a day 7 days a week for real money.

Legal Aspects

BringIt is not in any violation of any United States or International anti-gambling laws currently in place. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that playing video games online are not games of chance; rather they are games of skill. Games of skill are not in violation of the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2006.  Users are required to be at least 18 years of age. Certain US State laws prohibit skill based game play and these residents may not compete in BringIt’s skill based video game tournaments.

Games which may be played through BringIt’s website for real money include:

Burnout Paradise
Call of Duty 4
Call of Duty World at War

It's summary is as follows:

The Kursk was taking part in an exercise with the aim of showing the power of Russia's superfast 'Skhval' torpedoes to the Chinese.
The U.S.-Navy, not happy with the planned sale of Skhvals to China, had sent two submarines to spy on 'Kursk' and thus show U.S. discontent.
One of them (Forgot which-one) had a collision with Kursk.
As a reaction Kursk opened it's Skhval-equipped torpedo-tubes.
Knowing they had no defense against a Skhval the commander of the other U.S.-sub, in order to 'out-speed' a Russion attack ordered the firing of it's own MK.48-torpedoes.
One of them sunk Kursk.

Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation.
Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia, too deep to strip mine from the surface, too many surface openings to plug, and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things. That's why people needed to be relocated: living in Centralia is hazardous to one's health. And when coal is burned, it loses 90% of its mass, so the ground above often subsides, opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires. There have long been reports of more people living there than should be, possibly including some who were paid to leave.

I'll quote the relevant part for you:

Here's my best guess for who Slim Virgin's first account was:

I'll say why:

1) Created the Yvonne Fletcher article, just 1 minute after he had made his first edit to Pan Am Flight 103
2) Made many edits to Yvonne Fletcher article insisting that a marksman killed her, and pushing many conspiracy theories about it.  Encouraged links to Joe Vialls' sites on it.
3) Received a new user message on 14 December 2003, yet first edit wasn't until 17 January 2004, suggesting Darkaddress was in some trouble, and had edits wiped from history.
4) Basically stopped editing in July 2004.  Only made 2 edits since Slim Virgin started in November 2004.  These two edits were minor:  and , and were 6 months apart from each other.  This is suggesting that Darkaddress had a sock puppet.

Of course, this is all going with the theory that Slim Virgin is Joe Vialls.  It is just a theory.  It is at this stage a very thin theory, and I am hoping for some more meat towards it.  However, Joe Vialls is the only person I can think of who is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing and also is anti-Jews.  And, make no mistake, Joe Vialls is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing.  He is also an expert on Yvonne Fletcher.  Indeed, he is an expert on Jews themselves.  He just happens to hate them, and blame them for everything.  Joe Vialls is also a former policeman turned detective turned journalist and conspiracy theorist.  Supposedly Joe Vialls died last year.  Joe Vialls is extremely secretive, and nobody really knows who he is.  He also likes to sign his name """"JoeVialls"""".  A bit like """"SlimVirgin"""" eh.

The fact that she lost her title: I guess it seems reasonably backed up (Tadias site) and can be used in the article. However, I don't see why it needs to be said again and again. The story is straightforward and doesn't require a lot of words. She was the Miss Ethiopia World for 2003. She was stripped of the title by the Ethiopian Life Foundation when she stayed back in the Philippines after participating in the Nov 2003 Miss Earth contest. End of story. The rest (unsourced statements about Yodit Getahun, future Miss Ethiopias, or about contests that may be held in Ethiopia) is unnecessary. The entire article should be about three short paras.

 """"Right to be forgotten"""" 

I think that the present conflict between Google and the Spanish Data Protection Agency bears watching.  The Spanish are seeking input from the EU, and could in the worst case become a model for EU countries.  Many of the 90 people who the Spanish want censored from the Google results would not be affected the same way by Wikipedia - hopefully people would add information about a lawsuit's dismissal, and a principal known only for public urination wouldn't be notable.  But Wikipedians might believe that someone who murders but gets off on temporary insanity is notable, and shouldn't be allowed to move on with his life until the victim moves on with his.

Wikipedia might be a natural ally for Google, since balanced articles here, appearing high in the rankings, can offset the impact of raw hits on news headlines.  And Google's deletions, if forced, would hinder our research.  In the end, the way to deal with petty prejudice by human resources functionaries is to fight for equal and widespread access to employment, rather than to impose censorship.  The latter approach only helps those who have actually done things wrong, not those who simply have an appearance that bigots don't like.   """,0

Show 'n' Tell

A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation.  For all I know, I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented, mind game-playing geek living in inner Mongolia.  It is imperative, in my mind, that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence, as I have, of their actual ability, credibility, reliability, accountability...  their authority to control.  If it's required of the sources, it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them.  Similarly, how do I """"call for consensus?""""

"""The main theory I have come across in relation to Lilith is about belief.  If a person believes the Bible is the word of God then it cannot be wrong.  So, if the Bible states in Gen 1:27:

 """"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them,"""" 

and then in Gen 2:7:

 """"then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature,"""" 

followed by Gen 2:21:

 """"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.""""

These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.  If a person believes the Bible is the inspired word of God, written by men capable of error, there is no need for Lilith.

(It reports on the cricket in Adelaide, if that interests you.)

  

It is now published.  Good luck for the ODI in Perth!   
Yeah, I pinged someone on IRC to review it, because I wasn't sure of the current standards. Regards,   

 Archived clarification 

 Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.    
Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?   
The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.    
Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking.
Ridiculous...   
To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.    

Hi Daniel, sorry to toss another piece of bureaucracy at you, but since technically this was a clarification of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case, shouldn't it be posted on that case's talkpage? onka 
No, because it served to amend the SlimVirgin case. I will post a link at the talk page of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case to where the motions are archived, but given the Martinphi-SA case wasn't the one being clarified or altered, it's correct residence is the SlimVirgin talk page.   
 Okay, thanks.  )  I wanted to link to the archive, so I wanted to doublecheck that I was linking to the permanent home.  Carry on, onka 
No probs.

I was trying not to bog down my statement with too many terms, in that the goal of my statement was that gender is not relevant in the term of pedophilia.  This IP poster seems to have mistaken the term """"pedophilia"""" to refer to the sex itself, and I was attempting to point out that this is incorrect.  I was not isolating to just sex, but the full spectrum, making CSA the most appropriate term. """"Statutory rape"""" is not a very good term to use, because a) it is not used very often in laws themselves, but rather is a more of a pop term b)it technically only refers to intercourse and c)it can include sex with an mature but mentally handicapped adult.
I'm not ever sure why we are even responding to this IP poster.  My initial impression was the post was some kind of homophobic soapboxing spouted by a bigoted individual, with nothing remotely constructive to offer this article.  I pondered erasing it altogether under trolling guidelines, but I decided to just assume good faith in hopes of a reply.  But given the lack of reply, it would seem this was a drive-by.  """,0

 Adding alternative POV to the article 
This article's neutrality is questionable.  How should we add alternative articles into the text?  I propose that we add """"alleged"""" to the opening paragraph and include references that show that the facts and details are in dispute.

"I did not perceived you attempt to discussion, sorry. Actually the article is doing worst possible by the so named “finding of a number only” there estimations which are intentionally increased like the “Centre Against Expulsions” work. Unnecessary you need to point on somebody who is responsible it is enough offensive providing numbers which are subjective and biased. There are official more or less numbers of all nations population killed in WW II. You should start from this, until I know the Germany lost 8.7% of population in it 2 810 000 civilians. Thus it is impossible that the numbers can reach 3 millions during expulsion. Are you count also those who were collaborators of Nazi Germany? Well, …
I ask you to be reasonable. Do not put numbers which are just somebody biased “supposition”. Any way I found only one non-German estimation, which are Cold War effort most probably. Do you have UN or other independent sources regarding this numbers? Instead public “findings” which are very irritating you should look for objective source of information. Private multiplication of possibilities is offending. Do you know it? It is particularly such if you consider that other nations in fact lost much more and were not responsible for spark the hell of war.
In total proportion for one German in the WW II was kill ten people of other nations.
When somebody unleash beware dog who the culprit is? Dog or the person, and this is the case. I do not contradicts that after the WWII could occur lawlessness and lynches. Are you surprised of it? I am not, but you see if in competition during the 80’s the Soviets would invade Poland and Jaruzelski would support it in some way – we would blame Jaruzelski for our deaths in first place. The Soviets we world also, but first and above all Jaruzelski. He was the totalitarian and collaborator. Exactly the Germans should immediately and in first place blame Hitler and Nazi, though some love the Nazi ideology and activity.
Instead I see the article where numbers are juggled for God knows what. 
Thus I say to you the article look unbalanced and with bad faith. I just do not have time to discuss details as it is from the start bad. The tags are unimportant until you will point to Hitler and Nazi in first sentence as the primary culprits. You or others definitely opposed the introductions, so…?
The “recent” is not for philosophical deliberations. I took the word and sentence from the same article written long before I knew about it. Just I emphasize existing points – maybe deliberately hidden somewhere in the back and under carpet. Again, somebody dos not like the truth? Put “most recent” if you like. Do you?
You must be referring to Overmans and Ingo Haar, two historians. Does the total number two really justify a plural expression? Anyway, let's take a look at them.
I agree that total number of German deaths in Poland could be 1.1 milions. Twice there, 6 years of ocupations and guerrilla warfare, escape front od Soviet Army in winter 1944 and last the expulssion, which I can be shure was fewest deadly. But be specific with this numbers do not stick others. I very much beleave that in the post war phase the were revanges, but again are you surprised ?– evry 5th person in Poland was killed. Are you expecting after the “total war” against civilians evry of Polish citizen will be ideal christian and give you other chick to hit. If that was expected so it means the Nazi sin is all the more bigger.
Also, the XX236 sugestion is good . Change the title of the article.

[I was asked to contribute here by Faendalimas.] I have no knowledge of the background to the two genus names in question. There are, however, some obvious problems with the article's current text. Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced, and editorial opinions and recommendations are given. I don't think there can be any justification for including editorialising like """"The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play"""" or leading statements like """"The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is 'science' or just 'politics', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells' name for this taxon"""". We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether """"W. dorsei"""" warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like """"this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]"""", where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn't mention the case in question) – this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the """"genus currently contains five [...] species"""", but only four are listed. I would also recommend removing the Wikispecies link until it provides complementary information, rather than a blank contradiction. External links are meant to be a service to the reader, which that link isn't at the moment (no. 2 in WP:ELNO).   """,0

Fair use rationale for Image:321b.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:321b.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

As Mbz1 showed, the article on the Holocaust in Poland gives that exact wording. The Nazis wiped out Jewish life in Poland, which before the Holocaust was thriving.

"Factual error in this article 

I would like to report a factual error in this article. The error is that it says that WJ Clinton's presidential term began at the end of the cold war. Clinton served as POTUS after the cold war had already ended. This can be confirmed in the wiki article (as well as many, many other reliable sources as well). I request that this article remove and correct this erroneous entry in order to be accurate and correct (an important and very valid Wikipedia motivation). Clinton's term began in 1993, this is two years after the end of the cold war. The George H.W. Bush BLP should also be edited for the factual entry that GHWB served as POTUS (seeing that this is important and was included in WJC BLP) at the time that the cold war ended. The fact that Clinton had absolutely NOTHING to do with the cold war may or may not be added for clarity on this very important point in American history. Thank you and have a great day!

The followers of Claude Vorilhon call him """"His Holiness""""; what do you think of that? If they called him """"Holy Father"""", would that be legitimate? The pretension of a title does not mean that you ACTUALLY possess that title. The coptic """"patriarch"""" DOESN’T  have the right of being called """"His Holiness"""", """"Holy Father"""" nor """"Pontiff"""", because these titles are CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY CATHOLICS and they belong to the CATHOLIC tradition.

"Criticism doesnt seem so unbiased 

The criticism aspect doesn't seem very unbiased.  Here's why.  It intially begins by presenting both points of the view.  But then goes on to present Clint Eastwood's side of the view exclusively.  Basically after presenting Spike's viewpoint it doesnt go any further to explain why he said what he said and if he did know that black soldiers were indeed depicted in the movie 

Basically, it doesnt present third party viewpoints but goes on to REFUTE Spike's comments to SHOW that he was wrong. 
These actions(in bold) were done by the author of the wikipedia page instead of showing commentary or actions of spike lee and the issues involved.
While this may be true, it is not fair to present the information in such a way.  More comments should have been presented reflecting Spikes view point since a lot of text was used to tacitly support Clint Eastwood's viewpoint by refuting Spike's issues with the movie.

"""A shared working relationship and agenda, limited actual knowledge of the subject in this case and unfortunately no desire to seriously discuss how much to highlight an obscure thesis. Of course. Best to just put NPOV tag on the article because consensus is impossible. Not that the Edwards reference concerns me much. 

There is a published view that Advaita and """"enlightenment"""" itself is a fraud created by possession by power hungry beings, specifically referencing Ramana Maharshi. That view deserves equal treatment as far as being referenced. To quote the author: 

Consider this quote by the currently popular guru, Ramana Maharshi: “Repetition aloud of His name is better than praise. Better still is its faint murmur. But the best is repetition within the mind — and that is meditation. Better than such broken thought is its steady and continuous flow like the flow of oil or of a perennial stream.”

Ramana Maharshi’s statement represents mantra meditation’s goal: a state where the mind is timelessly identified with surrender to the name of one’s god – identical with the god himself. The mind itself has become self-negation at the feet of the deity. Empty of original thought and dynamic desire, the “liberated” person’s ego is dissolved: the very thing that made him or her human. All that is left is a mind-body shell, a meat-robot, that moves through life as a surrendered instrument of some greater will. I suggest the greater will is not that of the Infinite. It is the will of the god who has taken the place of one’s mind...

Does this sound like possession? It surely appears to be. Think of all the gurus you’ve met with their palpable shakti. An energy so real no one who experiences it can deny it. What is that light in their eye, a light beyond this world? Whose is that power they touch you with, embrace you with? Is it the shakti of Brahman, the light of pure consciousness? Or is it the power of Kali or one of her friends? Gurus often say they are the embodiment of Shiva, Kali, or some other god. Why do we not take them at their word?

I would like to suggest that mantra meditation turns humans into zombies who serve the agenda of the gods. That agenda is procurement of more humans and more human energy. This explains the common phenomenon of proselytizing by the religious, including fundamentalist Christians, TMers, and disciples of other varieties. Servants of “God” or the gods feel a driving need to bring in more recruits. The god that moves through them fills them with this zeal, as a hungry stomach fills the mind with an overwhelming need to procure dinner.

There are no gods, in the sense the gods would have us think of them. No one has been designated by the Infinite to control creation and administer the laws of nature. The sun shines by itself as an entity with its own consciousness. The rain and wind don’t need a god to direct them; they move where they will in harmony with their fellow elements. All things are children of the Infinite, spirits or egos in their own unique right, expressing in physical form and also in astral dimensions.

The gods are spirits/egos like everybody else. Most of the time they dwell on astral planes, which is why human senses normally don’t perceive them. According to ancient records, they have visited the earth in ages past in physical forms of their own, as entities from the stars.

They are no more divine than a ghost, no more cosmic than you or I, and no more entitled or intended to run the universe than any other gang of warlords might be. Somehow they’ve gained control of this planet, and have held that control at least since the beginning of recorded human history. But that is no reason to think the Infinite wants it that way, or that life needs to continue that way.

True empowerment is not the Indian concept of enlightenment. It is knowing what we are and living from there. We are spirit: individual and eternal, moving within the consciousness of That which created, sustains and pervades all life. Knowing this is not difficult. It only requires putting attention on that which is beneath the content of thought. Acting from this place of empowerment is natural: we can ordain reality from that quantum level. Everyone can do it. Everyone is equally powerful moving and creating in the depths of their own consciousness.

Unfortunately, people rarely do that, though, as the mass hypnosis that governs human life convinces us that karma, fate or the will of God runs the world, that we as individuals have little direct control over what happens to us. The gods are the purveyors of this global hypnosis. It serves their agenda of control. True liberation does not mean rising above the illusion of ourselves as egos. It means rising above the illusion that as egos we are cut off from the powerhouse of creation. That as individuals we are something less t",0

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajalt",0

I'll clear the air here before I continue upon the current situation. 

I feel like I am being painted as the bad guy here, and that my editing and/or the editing of others is considered to be an American POV. I quote 

 Yet it was apparently Americans who started this article.

For the record. Yes I started this article. No I am not American. Such accusations that I am American and therefore my stance at maintaining the American ratings is of a POV nature are not only unfounded but unfair.

Secondly in regards to the link and image. This is no place to discuss such an issue here to begin with, and bringing it up in this situation is simply adding fuel to the fire. Furthermore it is simply a slap in the face given that just hours prior to your post I had re-opened dialogue asking for help choosing 1 of 4 new images for the infobox located here: Talk:Rookie Blue#New_Image. Since you have brought this up I have no choice but to defend myself and the editors involved about violations of NPOV. The items in question were added in this edit:  at 23:08, 17 May 2010. At the time of the edit the only available material was from the ABC. I refer you to the following two links. The first will show that the ABC Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 28 Apr 2010. The second link will show that the GlobalTV Rookie Blue website was indexed on the 12 Jun 2010. Hell I will even used google.ca:

ABC:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fabc.go.com%2Fshows%2Frookie-blue%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

Global:
http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&lr;=&tbs;=qdr%3Ay&q;=%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltv.com%2Frookieblue%2Findex.html%22&aq;=f&aqi;=&aql;=&oq;=&gs;_rfai=

As you can see Logical_Fuzz did no wrong as the material from Global was not available to him/her till nearly a month later. As far as I know Logical_Fuzz is in the North American region. Specifically what nationality I am unsure of, but his/her edits were made in good faith and not in an American POV. Any further allegations that state me or other editors that have contributed to this article or the main article have violated NPOV, without proper proof backing those allegations; will not be met with too kindly.

Third. I was the one who added that is was a Canadian police drama (evidence here: ) as I accept it is a mainly a Canadian production. If I wanted to I could easily say it was a Canadian-American production. This should further dispel any such allegations that I am in violation of NPOV.

Now on with what I am to say. As I said I accept that this is mainly a Canadian Production. The page says Canadian but it also says the following:

 The series is a joint venture between Canwest Broadcasting and ABC, and produced by E1 Entertainment.

Given that Canwest also put out a joint announcement with the ABC () renewing Rookie Blue for a second season, I think it is fair to say a joint venture doesn't mean that anything American immediately takes a back seat. In regards to the """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here"""" comment. I am confused. Are you suggesting we remove the ABC as the original channel? Or have you just read it wrong and trying to argue that the picture and website don't below because it says """"Do not add foreign broadcasters here""""?

Read the first sentence of this whole exchange.

 Adaptively Reused churches and Former churches 

Hi Bencherlite, 
I've distinguished """"Adaptively Reused churches"""" from """"Former churches"""" because former churches could refer to any church building no longer used as a church, which would include demolition, closure, abandonment, ruin, etc. Adaptively Reused is an historic preservation / architectural conservation term for the reuse of a structure.

Hope this clarifies that neither category is really a subcategory of each other, although they do heavily overlap.

The """"critical reception of the series"""" section has been amended to reflect data taken directly from the series.  It does not speculate on reasons for the data, beyond identifying trends.  That the wife of the series editor appeared in the series, where the series editor is the primary screener of selections (but does not make final selections), is a notable fact, however one interprets it.  Given that Lehman has indicated thousands, if not tens of thousands, of poems are read for each issue of the anthologyand only 75 get inthe selection of his wife, who does not meet the notability criteria for a writer on Wikipedia, and has not published extensively elsewhere, is relevant to criticism of the series. The same can be said for those who have assisted Lehman with the production of the series, as well as those who have worked with or studied under Lehman.  Whether or not the trends are dispositive is beside the point (though mathematically, they are """"statistically significant""""); the point is that criticism of the series is based on this information.  While the blogosphere may not a preferred citation, previous edits of this entry prove that if it were necessary to establish (for the """"critical reception"""" portion of the entry, not the entry proper) the above criticism as pervasive in the only sphere it is alleged (in the article) to be pervasivethe blogosphereit would be a matter of picking which high-traffic links (of the dozens available) to select, and not whether any could be found.  On the blogosphere, it is simply the case that discussion of the BAP does not occur outside the context, or exclusive of the backdrop, of persistent allegations of cronyism against the series, and that it is the data that fuels this speculation, not whimsy or fancy.

Holocaust Denial?

Having read and re-read this article, I cannot understand why this section of the Jared Taylor biography even exists for several important policy-related reasons.

First, there is the policy issue of undue weight. It would be understandable that this section existed if Jared Taylor is known for his anti-Semitism or (more importantly) finds himself being the subject of journalists who cover his alleged Holocaust denial. After all, Wikipedia is a terciary source that relies on publicly verifiable secondary sources that document subjects in a NPOV fashion. The fact is, after checking Factiva, Lexis-Nexis, Google News, and JSTOR I cannot find a single article in a reliable mainstream source that associates him with Holocaust denial. Furthermore,  even the Anti-Defamation League does not accuse Taylor of such things. Right away, the alarm bells should start to sound based on those two facts and we should start scrutinizing a  little more carefully what is and is not relevant for this biography.

I'm not suggesting that inconvenient facts and criticisms found in reliable sources cannot be included in this article. I simply have not found them. As it is written now, I think what we have is clear violation of Wikipedia's undue weight policy in a living person's biography.   

Second, speaking of biographies, there is the all-important policy points for  writing biographies of living persons. Specifically, we are told to """"do no harm."""" Is it harmful to create an entire section on Tayler's alleged """"Holocaust denial"""" based on one journalist's question and Taylor's one-line response? To be honest, I think it is.

The question at hand is whether these are true facts that are pertinent to this Wikipedia page and thus deserve to be judged by the people who read it. This is, after all, a page in the Wikipedia and not your personal property. Is that not so? These facts are as follows:

1) Substantial numbers of horses which show many characteristics of purebred Appaloosas have been found in 2014 living in a remote mountain valley of Kyrgyzstan near the Chinese border. These horses exhibit spots, white sclerae, and striped hooves.

2) a DNA analysis conducted by Dr. Gus Cothran at Texas A & M University shows that these Kyrgyzstan horses closely match purebred  American Appaloosas in their genetics.

3) As of 2015, controversy exists as to whether these horses should be considered true Appaloosas. A BBC documentary shows the 69-year-old female New Zealand Appaloosa breeder who rode horseback over a 13,777 foot mountain pass to find these horses. This documentary clearly shows these horses in their native milieu and discusses the DNA evidence.

Now Mr. Montanabw Sir, are those facts not true?  Are they not germane? People come to this Wikipedia Appaloosa page to learn current and pertinent facts about Appaloosas. In that context neither your opinion nor mine count for a plug nickel.

Therefore I will now repeat my question . Exactly why are you continuing to refuse the addition of these facts to this Wikipedia page? If you wish, I don't see why an additional section cannot be added entitled """"Kyrgyzstan horse controversy"""" containing this information. Can you? 

Because if we can't resolve this question here, that is the issue I am going to ask the next level to resolve. I will not ask them to decide about LP genes or whether the BBC has made up some fairy story about the Appaloosa or whether the moon is made of green cheese. I will ask them whether you are in your legitimate rights to deny the inclusion of this information to the Wikipedia readers. Am I speaking clearly enough, Mister?

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor. If the article is improving now, then it's probably best for someone like me to just shut up.

Kane's secrecy?
quote from the article:
""""if the Allied campaign were to be completed in Red Alert, the Allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of Red Alert 2. It should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original Tiberian Dawn manual, which states that Nod is an African group in its origin, making no mention of the Soviet Union whatsoever.""""
if the instruction manual was written by GDI, then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of Nod were.  Maybe Kane planted information stating that it was from Africa; or maybe it really WAS from Africa, and Kane's attempts to drum up support in the USSR were unsuccessful.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to conflict, especially if it could be established that the manual was a GDI document, and therefore biased and uninformed.

Hi ,
 Re 1 and 2: I don't have access to any additional facilities.  I am a run-of-the-mill editor like you, not an administrator.  Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do; it does not require administrator privileges.  The procedure for doing this is described on WP:CP.  It does take an administrator to delete a page, however, which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations.  The notice is posted on the article in question, and on the WP:CP page, nowhere else.  Again, I have no subscription to EB, nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations.
 Re 3: If you scroll down WP:CP, you'll see it consists mainly of reports, with the occasional comment, many of which are not from the original poster.  Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window.  There are many new contributors who happily copy-and-paste from other websites, with utter disregard of their copyright notices, and our policies.  Have a look at some of the listed items for examples.  Most entries on the WP:CP page are in dated sections under """"New listings"""", but some have """"fallen off the top"""" into """"Older than 7 days"""".  
 Re 4: If you look at the original report on WP:CP#July 11, you'll see that  listed that URL.  Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice.  How that URL was found, I have no idea, but I would suspect search engines before spyware.  8-)  It's by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure.  I'm prepared to accept that it's within the bounds of coincidence.
 Re 5: You are correct; permit me to clarify.  People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like """"in Wikipedia"""", """"for non-commercial purposes"""", """"providing it is quoted without alteration"""", or """"on condition that the source is credited in a particular way"""".  Unfortunately, none of those (except perhaps the last) is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above.
 Re 6: New articles can be seen at Special:Newpages.  Changes to all articles can be seen at Special:Recentchanges.  Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check, but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users.
 I note with regret that  has just blocked you for 24 hours.  In the same circumstances, were I an administrator, I would probably not have done this, but you have to admit that you did twist each other's tails quite a bit.  Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project.  8-) Note that you can still edit your user page, and I think you can still send e-mails using the """"E-mail this user"""" link.  I'll add a note to both entries on WP:CP that we are in a dialogue.
 This is probably an unnecessary remark, but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me, I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion.  This is independent of my feelings about the block itself.  Sorry.

Technically, the MBTA replaced the MTA; it is legally not a descendant, but a new agency to which all of the assets of the old agency were transferred.  The MTA was financed under the authority of the Boston Metropolitan District (no relation to the Metropolitan District Commission), which persisted until all its bonds were retired in the late 1980s or early 1990s (check US Census Bureau's census of governments for details), long after the MBTA took over from the MTA.

Track connections between subway lines
As far as I know, there are no connections, direct OR indirect between the lines. The Red Line MAY have a connection to the Commuter Rail at the Cabot Yard or at a track near Neponset (just north of the Neponset River), but I doubt it. The Blue Line has no connections to any other rail lines. I think the Orange Line has a connection at Wellington, and the Green Line has only Riverside. So there MAY very indirect connections between the Red, Orange and Green, but they are never used except in emergencies (like when the Green Line flooded and Commuter Rail trains served Riverside).   

Just checked a few sources. A June 2000 track map shows no connection at Wellington or anywhere else on the Orange Line. Same for the Red Line. Of course it also shows no Green Line connection at Riverside, and I know that exists (but is usually fenced off). The track I remember at Neponset is a dead end (Java). At Cabot Yard (Red Line) and South Bay Yard (Commuter Rail) the two systems are totally separated, lookign at aerials on that same site. So the only one remaining to check is Wellington.   

Now the Orange Line USED to connect via Everett Shops, as did the Green Line (via surface tracks under the El). And the Blue and Red connected over the Longfellow Bridge, and there may have been a connection at Eliot Street Yard in Harvard connecting the Red Line to the streetcar line to Watertown and thus the Green Line, but I'm not sure about that. But at one point the Longfellow Bridge track did connect to other streetcar tracks. And I think I found a connection north of Wellington on aerials at http://www.globexplorer.com/ , but I'm not sure - shouldn't be too hard to spot from the Commuter Rail (harder from the Orange Line because of the unused east track) if it exists. But even if there is an Orange-Green connection via Commuter Rail (and fairly direct at that, using the Grand Junction Line), I would very much doubt it gets any use.   

So how do you figure all those nice new Red Line cars were delivered from Barre, Vermont?

 

Ah, here we go. Blue has none. Red has one at JFK/UMass, Orange has one at Wellington (last used ca. 1981), and Green has one at Riverside. None appear to be used at the present time. It would be rather misleading to suggest that there are in fact connections. How's this?

 Dispute with section on device drivers

There is only x86 drivers right now, but I can assure you that X86 drivers can run in Windows X64, provided they do not run in Kernel mode. Presumably, this driver is User mode, which Microsoft allows. It is also unsigned, but Windows X64 installed it anyway (proving it couldn't be x64 because Windows won't install 64 bit drivers unsigned. I can give some screenshots proving this.

The interior of the fictional Masyaf citadel in Assassin's Creed contains an extensive library, and the rear is a lush garden above a sheer drop. These two properties happen to be known features of the real Alamut, which was also a Hashashin fortress at this time. Subsequently, it is likely that the fictional Masyaf is a combination of features of both fortresses.

It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191). So there certainly are elements of the real Masyaf which have carried into the game, albeit modified. 

At any rate, a reference to Assassin's creed should only be made under the Popular Culture heading.   """,0

Roc Nation Template
Hi there ,

I'm sure you a nice person, but I would like to know the reason of why you have removed just the name of Tinchy Stryder and no other names on the Template:Roc Nation just under reason of """"Reverting edits by block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" when In fact I have been unblocked since 16 September 2011, and all the edits I have made to the Template:Roc Nation since the end of my ban have all been in good faith and correction of information and also of other WPA edits I have made from the knowledge I have on a specific WPA, have been made after my 1 month ban from the 16 August 2011 to 16 Sep 2011. So I just don't understand what you mean by """"block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" and when Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template, and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being co-owner of Roc Nation UK-based subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company, the same goes to Stargate (production team) who are the co-owners of the Roc Nation US-based StarRoc record label and publishing company. I would be grateful if you can give an explanation and if bias reverting of WPA edits, which is what this looks like in my oppinion is allowed by Wikipedia as I'm pretty sure it is not.

I see that you're idly floating speculative theories again, with another of your legendary flights of fancy. Rather than speculate without the benefit of evidence and reasoning, why don't you interview me to discover the nature and extent of my interest in troublesome (and troubled) individuals such as yourself. 

Are you a curious and courageous enough adventure writer to discover the unrevealed truth, or do you prefer to remain safely ensconced in a cocoon of child-like self-delusion, anonymity and utter indifference to the tragic harm caused by blindly acting out one's innermost fantasies? 

Rest assured, I am becoming increasing familiar with your legendary and oft-disclosed lack of caring, which seems to be a recurring issue in your life and recently published remarks.

And I appreciate that your dreadfully provocative remarks elsewhere may well be a transparent attempt to solicit the kind of caring that you apparently crave.

You have a keen sense of awareness of those who respond with a tiny measure of empathy and compassion to your repeated (dare  I say desperate?) cries for attention.  

So it appears you've chosen me as your antagonist, respondent, and reluctant mentor.  So be it.  I'm flattered.

Controversy flaw
JBL using racial slurs isn't actually controversial. It's part of his gimmick. It shouldn't be part of the controversy section.  

JBL's racial slurs as part of his gimmick are controversial.  Just because they're scripted does not make them non-controversal.  Further, JBL's comments are controversal just as the Cryme Tyme gimick has been controversial, too.

The controversial section needs some cleaning up. Where's the objectivity? Most of it assumes him as racist by making no dissemination between his personal beliefs, and his gimmick.

 Anyone know the date of his WWF debut? 
The best I can find is December 1995 as John Hawk against Savio Vega (http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/95.htm). Is that right.@ 

 Nicknames 
Should a section be added with """"Wrestling God"""" put there? I'm not sure if he's had any other nicknames or if it's notable enough. But it would seem so, other articles (see Triple H) list them.  
I don't think we should. Triple H has had multiple nicknames, 3 of which he still uses. Layfield used only that one, he used it sparingly, he was almost never called """"Wrestling God"""" by other superstars or commentators, and he has not used it in years. ( )

 Return To Active Duty 
It seems we've been entertaining a bit of looking into the crystal ball, here. JBL returns tonight on Smackdown, but until that show airs, it's not official unless it's properly referenced somewhere else (WWE.com or another reliable source).

"""I'm sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of 'Northumberland'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).

On the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can't deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.
As for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.

And as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn't proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish """"Viking"""" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don't care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly 'English'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.

Either way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.

Note: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn't about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it's folklore especially it's creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type.

The fact that there don't appear to be any, of course!!! For the sake of the argument, let me outline why I consider the story to be incredible (though not necessarily false). 1. Why were his parents permitted to have sex? 2. Why was he not aborted like other babies? 3. Why was he kept alive? Children are not cost-effective as slaves in the early years. 4. Why was he kept in the camp when he could have been transferred to an """"orphanage""""?  5. If he was dishonest about his mother's death, how can his honesty on anything else be assumed? 6. How could they afford to maintain an electric fence when they couldn't afford to feed border guards? 7. Why was a military uniform a """"passport"""" to travel through the country, when military service is compulsory? What did Shin do when questioned about his unit or purpose given his ignorance of the DPRK? 8. How was Shin able to trade, travel, survive, and escape better than the average North Korean given his ignorance? 9. Why would a hungry border guard let him through in exchange for food and cigarettes, when the guard could capture him, pocket the food and cigarettes, and gain a reward for capturing a traitor and prison escapee? 10. Given the long and largely unguarded border, why would he need to deal with a guard at all? 11. Finally, given that, by his own admission, he has next to no experience of North Korea, outside bizarre prison experience, how can it be established that he has ever been to North Korea, and is not an ethnic Korean from China?
I am sure that the book makes an attempt to explain some of these issues, but this is circular logic. Such an incredible story, would not be accepted so readily if it did not concern North Korea.  For various reasons, there are special """"DPRK Rules"""" which cause most people to suspend their critical judgement when assessing negative stories about the country. I fail to see why I, who unapologetically do not suspend my critical judgement, am subject to the onus of proof.  I rest my case.  21:48, 14 May""",0

Sure.  Definitely get some of what content creation you want to done, as that'll 1. help with a future RfA and 2. ensure you actually do it; you'll find that admin tasks end up taking a pretty substantial percentage of your time.  You don't have to do everything (I've maintained some content work and uploaded a few images since becoming an admin), but a few articles will be helpful.  Going the NPP route to adminship requires a very high degree of accuracy; I've seen you in CAT:CSD a few times, and never had a problem, and from what I can see that's an accurate impression.  I'll have to check your AfD participation tomorrow when I get a better connection, but putting in a bit of time over there is also good.  Some dispute resolution participation is also a good idea; it doesn't necessarily have to be resolving the dispute, but something demonstrating you know some of the channels.  And in all those venues, make sure you watch how admins handle different situations; people may ask you questions on different scenarios, and it's good to have an idea of how you'd deal with them.
You won't need a huge amount of anti-vandal work, but a few AIV reports and vandal reverts are good.  And as to the RfA process; it's hard to predict.  The Blade of the Northern Lights|My RfA went about as smoothly as one could hope, but the RfA of another exceptional user was a lot rockier.  One thing I can say is that it's nice to be the 2nd RfA added to the page, as those RfAs tend to have fewer people making mountains out of molehills (mine was the 4th RfA on the page, maybe that helped me).

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it.

Otherwise you should simply leave the question alone and not answer it at all and instead remove the answers which do not include a disclaimer or may be contrary to facts. 

Also, no one can be held responsible for providing an answer to a question, even if a disclaimer is not attached, in any scenario where the answer or """"advice"""" is free of financial charge. In other words, unless you require something of values in exchange for your answer or """"advice"""" you can not be held responsible for what your answer is. 

This is of course not the case when questioned by a police officer or other official or officer of the court who represent the State and are seeking an answer on the State's behalf. If you choose to answer their questions then you are obligated by law to tell them the truth although you are likewise permitted to withhold an answer or to provide a disclaimer if you do not.

Whilst the article does mention these things in one form or another, it really does need to be succinctly in this location as well. Many readers will come to this page, read the headings and skip straight to the contraversy section. Without differentiating in a small way my two points, we risk the reader coming away with a very biased view of stem cell research as a whole.  
It is a defect of this article that it talks too much about “cures” which indeed gives a biased view. The controversy section is best kept short, as there is a main article. 
I agree, the Controversy section is best kept short, not incorrectly biased and lacking information, as it currently stands.  
The controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise. That is all there is to it. 
Your anaolgy is about as crass as saying """"oh look, theres a dead body there, lets use it for fertilizer, after all, its dead"""". Whilst you might not agree with that analogy, it is roughly how many people would view your point. Your opinion whilst well informed isn't any more right then someone else who adheres to a different belief system. And thank you for clarrifying that it is indeed a contraversial issue. As a side note """"some people"""" covers a large portion of the people on this planet.  
No, because those embryos really do end in trash cans, whatever the whish of the family be. This is the general rule, whereas found bodies end up in the morgue, then are incinerated if not claimed. And the ashes are indeed used as fertiliser in this case. It might seem crass to say so, but it is still the truth. 

Stem cell research should be legalized everywhere. What would happen to people if they had any of their body part burned or worse? Stem cell research could help grow a new one based on the persons DNA et all and reattach back to the body. The wouldn’t reject it because it wont be foreign to it

January 2008 - Publication of the Neural Colony-Forming Cell (NCFC) Assay as a simple assay to enumerate neural stem cells. Importantly, the assay allows discrimination between neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells.

I dont consider the March 2008 key event to be so notable given that it was only shown in one individual and has not been replicated since.

Dear Mr. 147.252.223.38.

Please do not vandalize like you did to Fourier inversion formula. Math is a wonderful subject even if you don't appreciate it.

If, by """"get a life"""", you mean """"go to parties, get drunk, and crash your car into another car and die"""", then it's obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence that mathematics is far superior.

Also, you have no right to criticize people who do math unless you yourself can understand what they do. The mathematics you have criticized is deep and interesting and you shouldn't insult it unless you understand it. I hate the mentality that if you don't understand something you need to criticize it.

 Alpha Phi Omega (APO) International Service Frternity and Sorority 

Alpha Phi Omega (?FO) (commonly known as APO,Join APO in the fight against Breast Cancer! but also A-Phi-OUC Davis Greek Life - Alpha Phi Omega and A-Phi-QThe Gramblinite 4/30/2009 A Phi Q crowned champs again) is the largest collegiate fraternity in the United States, with chapters at over 350 campuses, an active membership of approximately 17,000 students, and over 350,000 alumni members. There are also 250 chapters in the Philippines and one in Australia.

Retrieved on February 23, 2007. and social opportunities for college students. Chapters range in size from a handful of active members to over 200 active members, independent of each college's size.

The purpose of the fraternity is """"to assemble college students in a National Service Fraternity in the fellowship of principles derived from the Scout Oath and Scout Law of the Boy Scouts of America; to develop Leadership, to promote Friendship, and to provide Service to humanity; and to further the freedom that is our national, educational, and intellectual heritage."""" Unlike many other fraternities, APO's primary focus is to provide volunteer service within four areas: service to the community, service to the campus, service to the fraternity, and service to the nation as participating citizens. Being primarily a service organization, the fraternity restricts its chapters from maintaining fraternity houses to serve as residences for their members. This also encourages members of social fraternities and sororities that have houses to join APO as well.

Alpha Phi Omega was founded on December 16, 1925 at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, by Frank Reed Horton and 13 other students who were former Boy Scouts and scouters, as a way to continue participating in the ideals of Scouting at the college level.

Unsourced Awards

In regards to """"unsourced and ridiculous awards"""", I have sources for them, as you will see below, and they're not ridiculous.  For example, Meryl Streep's page has her NOMINATED for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for The Iron Lady.  This means she ranked in one of the top 5-10 slots for said award, though she didn't win the award itself.  If you peruse her awards section, you will find many critics circle awards she did not win, but was """"nominated"""" for and the same applies to these awards.  This is common not just on Ms. Streep's page, but on other actors/actresses pages as well.  Nonetheless, I've made a compromise by removing Ms. Lange's actual rankings and replacing them """"Nominated"""" as per Ms. Streep's and others' pages.

I am not sure what the Shirra has to do with this. Surely it's documentary, graphic, archaeological etc evidence that counts, not the unreferenced thoughts of the early 19th century Scotland's answer to Jeffrey Archer.

Though in one respect you are quite right. The article is incomplete - there is no reference to F  J Grant's little book - Islay is on p 11 of gthe 1914 edition - available as a pdf download online.

""""The Scottish officers of arms formed an important part
of the Royal Household, and were in attendance on the
King on all occasions of state. Besides the duties enumerated
above, they were employed in accompanying embassies
abroad, making royal proclamation throughout the country,
carrying important messages of state between the King and
his subjects, and a summons for treason could only be
served by a herald or pursuivant.
As early as 1364 mention is made of William Pittolloch,
Herald; and in 1365, in the Great Seal Register, of John
Trupour, Carrick Herald (probably a mistake for pursuivant).
Lyon Herald appears in 1377, and ten years
later as Lyon King of Heralds. Rothesay Herald, officer
of the Prince of Scotland, is first mentioned in 1401:
Marchmont, a title derived from Marchmont, the ancient
name of the Royal Castle of Roxburgh, in 1436 ; Snowdoun,
derived from a part of Stirhng Castle, in 1448; Albany,
from the Duke of Albany, a title of one of the King's sons,
in 145 1 (he is called pursuivant, however, in 1447); Ross,
from the Royal Earldom of the same, in 1474; and tslay,
from the island of that name, in 1493. Other heralds are
also found from time to time, such as Ireland in 1498 and
Orkney in 1581.
Of the pursuivants, Carrick, Pursuivant of the Prince, who
was Earl of Carrick, appears first in the year 1365 ; Unicorn in
1426; Aliszaiin 1426; Dragancein 1429; Diligence in 1472;
Dingwall in 1479; Montrose, Bute and Ormond in 1488;
Falkland in 1493; Ireland and Kintyre in 1495 '> March in
1515 ; and Ettrick, """"pretendit pursuivant,"""" in 157 1.
The number of heralds and pursuivants became fixed at
The Heraldic Executive
six of each by the reign of King James VI., and continued
at this number till by the Act of 1867 their numbers were
gradually reduced to three of each as vacancies occurred.
The titles now [at the time of writing] in use are Ross, Rothesay, and Albany for
the heralds; and March, Unicorn, and Carrick for the
pursuivants"""".

Professor Simon Wessely and claims of harassment

PERMISSION TO REPOST

Below is a series of correspondence I have recently had with Professor Peter McGuffin, Dean of Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London, and John Williams, Interim Head of HR , at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London.

I have transcribed the correspondence by both, but have the original documents in my possession.

The contents of this correspondence are self-explanatory.

I am publishing this correspondence for two reasons:

1. I consider that I have been defamed, and seek to protect my good name and reputation against defamatory attacks of this nature.

2. This correspondence, sadly, provides merely one example of an increasingly unpleasant and worrying phenomenon. I have observed, over the years, a growing tendency, by some, to make grossly ad hominem attacks on ME/CFS advocates and the community at large. These are logically indefensible, and morally and intellectually unsound: and have had the effect of preventing reasonable, legitimate voices of criticism being acknowledged within the discourse of ME/CFS politics, with adverse consequences for sufferers. This is a phenomenon which I will return to over the coming months.

Angela Kennedy

1. Letter from Angela Kennedy to Peter McGuffin:

1st October 2007

Dear Professor McGuffin,

I am writing to you about a serious matter of defamation which potentially involves a member of your department, Professor Simon Wessely.

I am an advocate for my daughter, a young woman seriously ill and severely disabled by her illness, who was diagnosed with ME/CFS. I also politically advocate for the community at large. I am also a known critic of the ‘psychiatric paradigm’ of ME/CFS, and I undertake this from an academic perspective (I appreciate the above term might be contested, but that is not the issue at hand).

I am currently working towards publication on this issue, having been engaged in academic research for some years. I have a social science background and am an Associate Lecturer with the Open University (although the work I am undertaking in this field is not connected to this institution).

I therefore do have a reputation that might be damaged by libellous, defamatory comments.

In recent weeks, various editors of the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia have expressed an intention to publish claims that Professor Wessely has ‘retired’ from ‘CFS’ research because of ‘harassment’ by certain people within the ME/CFS patient community. The basis for these claims is the Gibson Report, an unofficial, unsourced, un-referenced document, which has been criticised for key inaccuracies, and inflammatory, inaccurate language about the patient community and its advocates.

I, with other advocates, have endeavoured to provide reasons and evidence as to why the Gibson Report is not a reliable source, and why claims of ‘harassment’ are, certainly at present, unsubstantiated and unsafe to the point they should not be published on Wikipedia. One advocate has attempted to clarify, by contacting MP Ian Gibson himself, the source of the comment, within the report itself, that Professor Wessely has retired from “CFS” research, and the claim that this was """"possibly due to extreme harassment"""" [my italics] present within the report. Ian Gibson’s researcher is following this up.

This is an extremely important issue. I, like many in the community, would condemn harassment of academics (particularly harassment as defined in criminal law), particularly as I am myself an academic, and because I have been subjected to criminal harassment before, which I have reported to the police. However, there is also a problem around the use of the term ‘harassment‘: ME/CFS sufferers and their advocates have for many years been subject to inaccurate ad hominem attacks on their motives for protesting the psychiatric paradigm. Inaccurate descriptions of legitimate critique as ‘personal attack’, or ‘abuse’, or terms actually associated with criminal ‘harassment’ are all too common, to the detriment of a patient community with valid concerns.

On September 26th, and 27th, 2007, a member of the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia posted a long attack on myself and others, which included the comments below, on their ‘Admin Notice board’, which were grossly misrepresentative of my work, and which",0
"I am in complete agreement with Kelisi on this one. One of the disturbing trends that I have witnessed on Wikipedia has been the propensity of users to actually REDUCE article sizes and chop out pertinent information. This is supposed to be a comprehensive encyclopedia and information database. By reducing article sizes and taking out relevant information about the topic itself, you are no longer facilitating the spread of knowledge or shared interests and it goes against the very principles of Wikipedia itself. Why would someone take out pictureso of the school or the staff and administration? That just seems inane to me.",0
"Your attempt to manipulate the argument by questioning my civility in this case and basing it upon previous dealings of mine is a mistake. That was between me and an abusive admin whom I had no recourse against. Regardless, that is neither here nor there and frankly has nothing to do with this discussion, so you can just leave it alone.

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack.

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0

Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

 Hi thanks for taking the time to respond Avi.  I had presumed you were Muslim because it said on your talkpage that you had contributed to the Abbey Hill Mosque article.  From your response I now gather you are of the Jewish faith so sorry if I have misrepresented you at any point. Have I got that right, you are Jewish, not Muslim? I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.  Is that right?
When I said most people are against it I meant that most people where I am from don't know much about it and if they did find out about the negative aspects of it (such as the complications (serious and minor), loss in sexual function, etc) then they would most likely take a somewhat negative view of it. I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it. 
It is done on children without their consent.  Most people would view this as ethically wrong - to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body (a particularly sensitive part at that).  
It can cause pain (people generally don't like to see children in pain).  
They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done.  They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact.
 What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.  
 I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to.
 Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define """"circumcision"""" would ask the question, """"which type? Male or female?"""" In the last post on this subject, at talk:circumcision, I said this and I don't think you or Jake responded.  I took that as meaning you didn't have a counter-argument to what I said.  My point there was that we should be as specific as possible and that being accurate is more important than using the most widely used term.  This is following the Wikipedia naming guidelines.

 Dear Mr. Jim Handerson, please read the 09:58 16 July 2012 fightingagainstlies edition of the article. You will understand that what I am mentioned. 

Oktay Sinanoğlu (born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled """"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book""""[1] he describes himself as: """"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,""""[2] """"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,""""[3] """"a man who reached the level to say, """"I'm God"""" in science,""""[4] """"the Lord of the U.S.A.,""""[5] and """"The Turkish Einstein.""""[6]

Childhood and High School Years (1934-1953)

Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was """"Ankara Maarif College"""" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.

Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18

In his autobiographical book entitled """"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,"""" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT """"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey"""" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.

A University Student in the U.S.A. (1953-1960)

He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.

Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.

According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: """"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: """"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.""""[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.

Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable. Sorry if I didn't give a better thought on it before contacting you. Cheers! (talk)

 Jewish Supremacism (My Awakening to the Jewish Question) 
Hi
@Mike Rosoft: please explain where the text is promotion of the book and the ideas contained in the book? In the first time is better that define the portion of text that had problem.
  
 Considering the draft presents a hateful and insane conspiracy theory by a white supremacist as if it were factual?   

Hi
@Ian.thomson: Please talk about Wikipedia rules and do not tell insult word. I say that this is not a valid reason for speed deletion. The admin must stated it in talk page until solved.
  

@Mike Rosoft:Please reply to my question. Do is G11 rule in speed deletion? 
  
The draft presented lies by a known conspiracy theorist as """"meticulously research.""""  To call that promotional is better than that deserves.
WP:G11 says that """"Unambiguous advertising or promotion"""" is to be speedily deleted.  The lies David Duke wrote were promoted as """"meticulously research.""""    

@Ian.thomson: You have a personal problem with this book and the idea of the author. Please observe the rules and don't tell loose talk. This is your idea about this book that is a lies but many people in the world are against to your idea. I decided to edit this subject and submit in this page. 
  

@Mike Rosoft: In the content and purpose of book sections, I selected and wrote several sentence from this book. So, I think some people had against idea with it. I want introduce this book just and i had not any goal. please explain about text and say where have problem?

"First Paragraph is a Joke 

Hilarious how Wikipedia purports to have a NPOV policy yet articles such as this continue to show just how liberal-biased its editors actually are. To wit, the first paragraph is an absolute joke. It might as well be a full-scale endorsement of modern liberalism. Focus on “individual liberties” so long as they don’t intrude upon the liberties and rights of others? That’s actually libertarianism (about as far right as you can get). How about modern liberals favor bigger government, higher taxes, and redistribution of wealth? No, that would be telling the truth, and wikipedians hate the truth if it places their ideology in a bad light. No matter what sources you bring to the table, and no matter how many you bring to the table, the masses of welfare-loving, big-government-favoring, anti-American, anti-religious, pro-terrorist, socialist democrat monkeys who run this mickey-mouse operation will (1) find a problem with the source (even when it is a peer-reviewed journal), (2) claim other sources favor the opposing viewpoint (even when their sources come from unreliable, and HIGHLTY biased sources), or – and this is the most common response – (3) try and interpret your source in a manner that would make it consistent with their own views (in vain, but since consensus carries the day, they end up winning). I’m giving up on this site. It’s a %@#$!&&$ joke.65.247.226.99",0

 Spventi: """"but perhaps it's safest to discuss your concerns before making arbitrary changes."""" - Indeedly. Sorry for my thoughtlessness.I have no intention to suggest a change from """"nakashite"""" to """"nakasete,"""" but would feel better if """"miseyo"""" is changed to """"miseu"""" or """"miseyou"""" because みせよ cannot be an expression of volition.The version in Spventi referred is modernized in wording, and both of the two sources say it was written by 松浦靜山, I would say みせう is the original. Plus, the explanation 「松浦靜山の『甲子夜話』にみえる川柳。おそらくはよみ人知らず」 sounds much more reliable than 「江戸後期の平戸藩主・松浦静山が詠んだ句」. Then, みせよう should be a more adequate modern Japanese word here than みよう. I suspect that it might be a typo or mistranslation. Now, here is a third source; a text book for junior-high ISBN 4-594-03155-2, in which the one for Hideyoshi is written as 鳴かぬなら鳴かしてみせようほととぎす. Spventi: """"then the onus is on you to provide information that suggests otherwise."""" - Indeedly. But I can't find an english word to express hototogisu. That is why I questioned. It is a family of cuckoo, but smaller. And it really sings. A popular bird next to uguisu who tells you the spring has come, while hototogisu being the one for the summer. Here is an illustration. I was not suggesting to change the word, but just asking whether there was a better word to be used here. If not, it can stay as it is.Spventi: """"your concern about the word """"coax"""" is entirely misplaced."""" and Jim_Lockhart: """"I think coax is fine for saying that"""" - Hmmm. I withdraw. I trust you two than my dictionaries. One comment to Jim_Lockhart. Yes, he used flattery when necessary, especially in his early times, and I don't think it gives a negative feeling by describing him that way. That was not my worry. What I wanted to say was that it is only one face of him. You wrote """"resourseful as he was"""", agreed.Now that I accepted the word coax and the form without first person, I admit Spventi's saying """"the changes you made to the English versions of the senryu were clearly not improvements.""""

 Korean articles 
Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

 Do you work for NAD ?

I find it interesting that arguments made in this propeganda material http://www.nad-plo.org/facts/wall/WallMagazine%207-2005.pdf (such as that the wall actually does not save lives and does not increase Israel security ) have found their way into this article.

Let me be clear:

There are two groups who don't like the wall.

The two groups are: Palestinians who are against the two state solution
Settlers who are against the two state solution

Each of these groups think, that by using force (and God) they will eventually drive the other people out.
The Palestinians who object the two setate solution and the settler all see a big problem in the wall: It creates a border, a demarcation line.

So natually, both of thse groups are trying to show that the wall is bad and not working.

WE should reresent this on this article but not in the way you have done.

Since I am sure you are not a settler but I know you are from Ramalla I wonder if you are one of those paid 20-30 researchers and PR experts in NAD ?

I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation.

The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites.

Statement by Justallofthem
On the whole, I agree with BigBlueFish that the extensive quoting of critical reviews is a bit over the top. I would not go so far as to call the article a """"quote farm"""" of course but the Critical reception section comes close. I also see the article as serving as a vehicle for panning """"all things Scientology"""". Example, featuring the ridiculous rumors spread by anti-Scientologists such as the alleged subliminal messages. Example, the entire Controversy - Scientology sub-section that leads off with an OR interpretation that there was something controversial about the rights holder, Author Services, and continuing with undue emphasis to further invented controversy based on scant and clearly biased sources, mainly two anti-Scientologists, Bunker and Wollersheim. In actual fact all we have is a pet project of Travolta that was produced by a questionable character (not a Scientologist) and that was a big flop. The rest is invented controversy. I do not think this project, as an encyclopedia, needs unduly forward invented controversy, let alone invent more.   """,0

 Blanco, Hitler and Mussolini

Also, in the section Relationship with Hitler and Mussolini, it says: """"While Franco ruled undemocratically, he seems to have reluctantly accepted that Spain would be a democracy after his death."""" This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy.

Well it has been changed, also it may have been recorded in 1976 but no singles were released and the album wasn't released then so no one could hear it or buy it. The references are in the inlay booklets provided with CD's so don't delete it. Also it clearly states her hit singles career was very much gone by the 1980's after several changes in musical styles, many of which finished off bands that were in when Suzi Quatro was at her peak. It was new wave that finally finished Suzi's recording career, that and motherhood. Also what is this rubbish about her being a major rock star? I could perhaps agree she was in the 1970's but certainly not now! Infact most young people below about 25 have probably never even heard of her. She had her last U.K top 75 hit in 1982 and her last hit in America in 1981 for crying out loud!

Alright,  through all of the various discussions on various article:talk pages, AN/I, and user talk pages I see so many different conversations.  Well, people keep saying that I could use a mentor.  That I have turned it down.  Guess what, look at my userpage, I have asked for one and still ask for one.  .  It has also been stated I keep using non RS.  If you look here, I state that when a source is stated to be non-RS I never use it again.   I saw that Niteshift went to RS/N to identify usadojo and ashidakim as non/RS. I never used those sources again. I used RS/N to identify if boxrec and judoinsider are reliable sources (although I don't have a reliable answer).  I primarily just use Google news and google books, but user 82 or maybe niteshift (I am unsure which one) stated that even books on that might not be considered to be RS such as  written by Al Gotay because they are written by him are unreliable (when I was only using them as an example of books he wrote for his own notability as an author).  Again, I don't work for wikipedia or any organization that wants to have articles up.   What I do here is volunteer my time to disseminate information (I was trying to work within the guidelines).

I will make an admission, I am an urban male of color from an urban environment.  For the most part, I am writing for a specific audience.  I don't expect individuals who are from different environments to see the world in the same way I do.  People like Marcus Garvey or Buffalo Soldier's may not be important to the general American but are pretty important to  those in the African American community.  WP:WORLDVIEW.  Dutty Boukman is important in the history of Haiti and the African diaspora, but an unknown when it comes to the majority of the  anglo world.   It is difficult to find information from mainstream media sources on minorities on many important figures.  Think about how hard it is to find information on historical individuals such as Malcolm X, Frederick Douglass, George Washington Carver on BBC News, Time Magazine or Newsweek.  You may find some information on Ebony Magazine, Essence or Jet Magazine.  Think about how hard it is to find moderately notable figures as shown here.    The use of blogs  and indb   does highlight some individuals but wouldn't be considered to be a reliable source.  So how can I find online sources? Printed sources I know can be used, but if people can't see the books there is little in the way of Verifiability.   Thus we have issues like Basile Croquère  and George Cofield and listed in  black heroes in the martial arts  not having a wikipedia page.  Jose Landi was deleted in March 2014 and later speedily deleted when I tried to recreate it.  This forced me to have to take it to DRV to have it recreated.  This is for an individual who is considered to be a top 10 black martial artist in the history of MMA.     

Fact remains blacks and latinos make up about 80 million people in the United States.  About 1/4 of the population  but many important individuals in their history is underrepresented on wikipedia.
Call me an idealist, as I have read about the decline of wikipedia from how newer users are treated  , male oriented with a western bias  .  I read the New York Times writing that """"“The stereotype of a Wikipedia editor is a 30-year-old white man, and so most of the articles written are about stuff that interests 30-year-old white men,” said James Hare, president of Wikimedia D.C., the local branch of the foundation that runs Wikipedia. “So a lot of black history is left out.”""""   Now please don't accuse me of being a racist because of me bringing up the quote.  I won't even bring up the problems of sexism on wikipedia. [http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/29/wik",0

 Prince Charles 

One of my relations shares the same birthdate as Prince Charles, so I wrote to his secretary and (at the most) expected to receive a letter from the secretary. This came a week later and my relation was pleased. A few days before 14th November, we received another letter - this time a handwritten letter from Prince Charles - and a tin of biscuits from the Prince's organic estate. The Prince's handwriting is a bit difficult to read, but he made a joke in there which made my relation chuckle. He also said that because of the bad weather, a party for people of the same birthdate had been cancelled.

User:A930913, User:Dru_of_Id, User:Legoktm, User:Bgwhite 

I appreciate the computer's catching three syntax errors in the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Aerospace_Control_Squadron.  These have been around several years but it is good to know about them.

They occur in the lists of personnel at 1st Aero, their job descriptions (showing now jobs were defined and allocated to different ranks), and the courses offered as training in the development of the squadron's activities for the first formative years.  However, a few days ago, I had occasion to look at the article and saw that, last year, someone had removed all  this detailed personnel information except for the list of Squadron Commanders.  I restored this information recently, but it has again been removed with the comment by BB-PB

grossly excessive level of detail - none of these people are notable

It is a matter of opinion whether, as trackers of man-made satellite, people who have done things that have never before been done in human history are or are not notable.

Is there any way to appeal this decision on the grounds that the listing provides useful historical detail not available elsewhere about the organizational progress of early satellite tracking in the US?  My Ph.D. is in Management Theory so I think this is worthwhile information that should not be suppressed.

I removed the list of Commanders (as that is trivial compared to the other information) and inserted this remark):

""""The historical development of the Squadron is shown by detailed listings of personnel with dates and citations. However, a Wikipedia monitor refuses to allow this level of detail. Copies of the information are available on request from the author.""""
The list of commanders has again been restored, repacing my comment, and I have removed it as they are not notable  it is the workers who did something special.
But the commanders are again restored.

If an appeal is permitted, please tell me how to do that.  seaotter6@aol.com""",0

Your recent editing history at Centrifugal force shows that you are currently engaged in an edit war. Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.
 
To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors.

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time. Please see forums.worldatwarmod.com and check the Firearms section for evidence of notability. Thanks.  SWATJester  Ready  Aim  Fire!

Since I voted, further evidence of notability has been added so I have changed to a keep vote.  

On the same subject, the article was kept per the afd, but you might want to establish the notability further on the article itself (by including some references to it on notable sites etc.) so that someone else won't just nominate it again in a few weeks. Thanks. -

"On your poorly researched (it should have taken you an hour or two to read through the raw data on Underwood) response 

You're talking to the wrong guy. Not only did I not start any editwars. I didn't initiate any personal attacks either, I used the talk page the way it is supposed to be utilized, to initiate discussion on the subject of an influential person to the Church of the SubGenius. Someone who at bare minimum is a church in-joke and at maximum had a chilling effect on a number of the members. I suppose you are off to edit DooM out of the article on the Columbine Killings as it was released several years before the killings happened and there is no direct causal relationship between it and the killings, only people who claim there is a causal link. Kevin Underwood affected the church. Nearly every member of note has an opinion on the booger, and all you have to do is mention Underwood on the talk page to get swarmed by Church member caretakers and hack attacks (a variety of these have taken place in the last few days while discussing editing the article, from blocking of the page entirely, to abnormal (10 minutes or more) page load times, to apparent deletion of talk points after loading the page.) What you have here is a page zealously defended by a bunch of nuts who are so zealous about their complete disassociation from Underwood despite comments by Church co-creator Ivan Stang regarding him AND conversations with him, that the protestations are evidence themselves of his effect on the Church.

 Response to Gnangarra and a suggestion for a compromise 
Introduction:Thanks Gnangarra for your comments. Everyone interprets policies differently and this talk page is no exception to that. There are two policies widely debated here, which are WP:BLP and WP:UNDUE. I am summarising opinions of the editors involved in this discussion based on the current talk page, I did not include opinions from BLP notice board and individual members talk pages. If I may have made mistakes (unintentional) in the summarisation, please feel free to remind me and I will correct. Now, while Gnangarra, Pete (Skyring), Suturz and Yeti Hunter think it is WP:BLP violation, MickMacNee, Merbabu, Orderinchaos, Peter Ballard, chaser, Lester, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont. Gnagarra and Orderinchaos believe it violates WP:UNDUE MickMacNee, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont.

Quote from WP:BLP

My interpretation:The reason why Gnangarra thinks it violates BLP is because of the availability of only one reliable source. As far as I understand, reliable sources in plural do not mean that it needs more than one reliable source. Even if a strict requirement for multiple sources need to be strictly followed as asserted by Gnangarra, we have more than one instance when Howard was accused of war crimes as noted in the begining of this talk page, including the head of a state. Please remember the key word here is war crime allegations not crimes. Due to these reasons, I personally think that this does not violate BLP (as with many others).

Clarify you are taking my comments out of context, you ask specifically what policies was I quoting for opposing the text. It was the lack of multiple independent sources, ie one reliable source the ABC article, though still questionable as its lacking specific details. In this BLP is clear poorly source contentious material should be removed. garra 

Quote from WP:UNDUE
 and 

My interpretation:
I guess the first quote deals with two different views. An example can be that one view being that the world is round and one being world is flat. In our current dispute, I am not sure what we are comparing. Are we comparing reports that he was alleged of war crimes and not alleged of war crimes (if such reports exists which contradict the ABC news reports) or are we comparing that he was alleged of war crimes and he never commited war crimes. It is hard to make the distinction here.

The second quote says that minority view should not be represented at all except in articles devoted to those views. The content in dispute may fail inclusion as per WP:UNDUE because the belief that he commited war crimes are held by a small n",0

I also understand that """"My"""" personal point of view, what ever it is on what ever topic, should not be reflected in the article because I think so.

You are the first editor to take any time with me. I see that, and I see that we do not agree on many interpretations of things. I like this.

Forgive my lack of experience, I feel new. My first edit(HC way back when) rash, and I had thought that commonly accepted applied to recent events. I am learning and apologize if it has been seen as wasting your time. 

I have added a few accepted edits. I am particularly proud of my change to Sin, the sub section header, Etymology, as opposed to the prier History of the word.

However, both articles have problems.

"""POSTED FROM MARYLAND TALK PAGE WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM Thisisbossi

I'm getting the sense of a double standard for Maryland here. Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...

If you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, 

 """"Virginia is known as the """"Mother of Presidents"""", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the """"Mother of States"""", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.""""

How is that anymore relevant than proclaiming """"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.""""? Doesn't talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?

Not convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,

Wisconsin's rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.

In previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it's a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?

Didn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

During the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.

The state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.
As of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.

Must I continue? It should be clear by now.

 Concerns
Got a message about an hour ago from Professor Obar of the Media and Telecommunication Policy project and I think it is viewed best in full:

Can you please communicate to the online mentors that I DO NOT want them moving student material into the main space for them. This is a big problem. I have noticed that this has happened with a number of the projects already, for example, in the broadband.gov article and the media cross-ownership article. We need the students to be doing this on their own, of course so they can learn how to do it, and also so that I can grade what they've done. How am I supposed to follow student submissions if the data is associated with online mentors? A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY... please help me with this. None of you responded to my post about this on the discussion page. This is about to get out of hand. Jaobar (talk) 

With that, of course, please only give instructions on how to move, don't do it for them.  Please only let them know what to do and let them do it themselves.  If they run into problems, provide further instructions.  Do not it for them.  This seems to be making a mess of Prof. Obar's grading system and I would like to avoid that.  Thanks. -  • Talk • Coor.

There's no need to compromise an article to placate cranks on the Talk page; respond to them on the Talk page.  
There are separate questions:
Why is it called the """"World Series""""? 
Is it justifiable to call it """"World Series""""? 
Is """"World Series"""" meant literally or just a label preserved for historic/traditional reasons?
Regarding the answers:
The answer would appear to be: 1880s hype + 120 years of tradition/inertia.  
The first bit should be in the history section. The reference says In 1884, the Providence Grays of the National League outplayed the New York Metropolitan Club of the American Association in a three game series for what was originally called """"The Championship of the United States."""" Several newspapers penned the Grays as """"World Champions"""" and the new title stuck. 
It would be nice to cite an 1884 newspaper saying something like """"The Grays are now the Champions of the United States; indeed one might well call them the Champions of the World."""" 
""""the new title stuck"""" is rather vague: did it stick instantly and unanimously? Looking at the contemporary match programs on baseball alamanac, 1911 is World's Championship Games, 1912 is World's Series, 1930 is for the Championship of the World, 1940 is World's Series, 1941 is World Series. It's worth distinguishing """"World Series"""" the series of matches from """"World Championship"""" the title at stake in the series.
The """"New York World"""" urban myth is widespread enough to be mentioned and debunked. 
 """"The title of this championship may seem odd to some readers"""" is not a justification for answering this question, since it relates to the previous question. The justification would be something like """"Some people have (jocularly or otherwise) questioned the appropriateness or accuracy of the name World Series""""  
I speculate that there should be some juicy examples of such questioning from U.S. journalists in the 1880s, or Latin Americans in the 1960s.  There is the quote attributed to John Cleese: """"When we [the UK] hold a World Championship for a particular sport, we invite teams from other countries to play, as well.""""  
There are various arguments pro and contra that might be made. But only those that have actually been made by noteworthy sources should be given. 
The relevant information seems to be present in the article.

"""

This RS question is whether Stephen Hill, the cofounder of a notable niche music genre, """"spacemusic"""", can be disqualified as a secondary source expert, and have his radio production company's website (= expert's book) reclassified with primary source usage restrictions (results in removal). 

The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago (35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA). HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500. This 2004-01-11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill's expertise reads: 
""""Hill, who coined the term """"spacemusic"""" more than 20 years ago, hosts the """"Music From the Hearts of Space"""" music program, syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations, including San Francisco's KALW 91.7 FM, which airs two hours of the program at 10 p.m. Sundays. In addition, Hill's Hearts of Space Web site (www.hos.com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music.""""

The claim as I understand it (maybe I don't), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis/OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder's detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. 

The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a """"commercial entity's branding drive"""". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. 

Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame. Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered, but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives. Its niche music sales amount to less than 1% of the commercial market, so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising. 

(The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary, and then removed for synthesis/OR, should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload.) 
 

 I suppose all this would give some reason for caution in using these sources, and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double-source things and to give all sides where sources disagree, but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source. Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre, or about his own show, he's primary. Where he's writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. -  | Talk 

I agree with  on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic.  On the primary/secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show. On third-party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he'd be a secondary source.   I'd say that within his area of expertise, there's no reason not to use his work as a reliable source.   

Just to be clear about the encyclopedia-margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying: 

Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert-based secondary sources via WP:V(WP:SPS). The Wikipedia art/music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art/music genre knows subjectively more about what he/she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion. You are changing that.

What a secondary source says can be combined in a point-by-point source-provable editorial analysis. In this case, since there are so few other mainstream sources, many or most of them are presently combined with Hill's previous secondary source expertise to write the article.

But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source. What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis, even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t",0

Podczas składania kwiatów pod Pomnikiem Czynu Powstańczego uczynili oni gest pozdrowienia poprzez podniesienie prawej ręki. Geneza tego gestu sięga Cesarstwa Rzymskiego. Był to tzw. „rzymski salut” stosowany podczas powitania cesarza. Gest ten przejęli później włoscy faszyści, a następnie faszyści niemieccy, którzy unosząc w górę prawą dłoń jednocześnie wypowiadali słowa: „Heil Hitler”.

Zgodnie z pkt 5 rozdziału I statutu: „ONR może używać odznak, pieczęci i innych symboli na zasadach określonych w przepisach szczegółowych”. Przepisy te nie regulują jednak kwestii, czy zapis ten odnosi się również do pozdrowienia poprzez podniesienie prawej ręki.

 NPOV again 

First of all, I'm Brazilian and PRO Lula. I want a more neutral article. Not all the people in Brazil, I know, like him. But not all the people hate him. Every one knows what NPOV means, it would be rather a Multiple Point of view. So, criticism and good things must come together. Althou, Wikipedia cannot agree with bias, hate or fanatism.
Here is a list of some alterations I made and a bit of opinion:

 Biography: it is alright. It is a standart biography...
 Elections... """"In the second round of the 2002 election, (...) and became the president of Brazil."""" instead of """"to become the president-elect of Brazil"""". Just a bit of grammar.3
 The Government - Political Orientation: some time before, I transfered a piece of text about the radical-left-wing of PT from this article to PT's article. I DID NOT DELETED it. I just put it in a better place, because it is not a personal problem of Lula, but a problem for the party. Every one agree? The external links about it i tranfered to PT's article, too.
 The Government - Reforms and Important Laws. When I first wrote it I put each item as a section (I was pretending to write a piece of text for each one). It was oversized and so, following a sugestion, I changed it in a list. All right?
 Deleted: """"Unfortunately, there has been no control over the program on behalf of the government and """"Bolsa Família"""" has been transformed into mere populism."""" - It is not the common sense. It is a political point of view of an action of the government. Populism is a dangerous word that must be avoided. Maybe we could use another phrase instead, like it: """"Althou, there is some criticism on the efficency of this project."""".

"""::::::First off, Miles and Blume came to the same conclusion, and Blume said he did interviews, so I'm assuming Miles didn't pull his statements out of his behind and actually talked to some residents about the riots. That would be the logical conclusion since he's one of the few in Lhasa for the riots, so why would he just hang around making assumptions about what they were complaining about without any evidence whatsoever? Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started? Does that point to nationalism or does that point to the same type of anger you or I would feel if we saw nuns getting shot by the police? I already addressed your """"proof"""" of nationalism by the Chinese flag being trampled. You are free to actually read what I say. And someone who attributes flag burning and pro-tibet slogans as proof that the riots were not because of ethnic hatred, but because of nationalism (and implying that the cause of the riots were for independence/autonomy) has no right to criticize how the current article is written. Your own """"proof"""" is 100% presumptuous, while the argument I make is actually from what the Tibetans have reportedly said. Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154

"Demonising Turks 

It is obvious from certain Wikipedia articles that many people are using it as a vehicle to demonise Turks. Wherever possible articles derogatory to these people are being written, media and writings manipulated so that when a search is done of Google - only one version - a completely Christo-Armenia, Greek Othodox version can be found. It is seems that as in America, Armenian and Greek lobbying is alive and well here, too. What a shame that Jews, who found solace in the Turkish Ottoman Empire, while the rest of Europe was have progrom festivals have come on board, too.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.

"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.  There is no way operational costs equal or exceed this value even if they bought brand new servers every other year, which doesn't seem logical given my knowledge of networking.
Now they might be incorporating expansion costs, ie the new server banks in Russia and other countries, and other related costs to expansion in costs of business when saying they operate at a loss.  Hate to break it to ya, this means they're just spending money they already earned.  So yes, they do in fact earn that much money, they just spend it as fast as they earn it.

Saul Friedlander states that """"a man above all: Hitler"""" started the process and that it was not """"generated in the machinery of Nazi and SS administration"""". That is quite normal he argues in that direction, given he is an """"intentionalist"""".
The opposite quotes can be found as well 
 Christopher R. Browning, The Path to Genocide: Essays on Launching the Final Solution, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.87 writes 
""""Martin Broszat and Hans Mommsen, however argued that [the mass murder] occured without any specific and comprehensive Hitler decision or order. The system's automatic mechanisms for 'cumulative radicalization' more than Hitler's ideology and leadership explained the origin of the Final Solution""""  
 Gerald Fleming, Hitler and the Final Solution, University of California Press, 1987, p.II writes 
""""It may be tempting to state that each approach has its merits and to seek an synthesis between the two positions. In fact, functionalism, which stresses the dynamics of a system instead of a central role of a leader, fits better in many ways within the mainstream of modern historiography. The image it offers of Nazism is more 'normal', easier to explain: any group can stumble hapharzadly, from step to step, into the most extreme criminal behavior. Responsibility remains obviously; but it is more deluted, more nebulous, because of the very automatism of the process, its outcome unforseeable, and because of the absence of real premeditation as well. Intentionalism at the other hand asserts that the course of action was in some way planned. This latter view gives Hitler a predominant role, but it also implies much greater awareness at various level; whereas functionalism pushed to its logical conclusion, gets very close to denying that Hitler had accurate knowledge of the Final Solution. It leaves most of the operation to subordinates agencies - in a nutshell, to police terror.""""

 Rostling 

Rostling is a alternative form of wrestling, a form of """"Worshiping God"""".  Normally done at small groups, there is always an entertaining match.  The reason it is played in small groups is due to the indisputable fact that it was invented in one of the these such meetings.  Bronski Wookie (name changed for security purposes), is credited with the invention of this game.  There are two judges, both decide the weight classes.  If there is a tie, then the judges decide who is the winner.  The game itself is like wrestling, but it allows a formerly banned hold: the behind-the-head choke hold.  Once in this hold, if held long enough and done right, the captive is forced to tap out due to lack of oxygen.  The rostler most known for this hold is named Justin Bieber.  No, not the girl, the rostler.  Never heard of him?  He often wins his matches by properly executing the choke hold.  
 To play the game 
 1. Both contestants start at opposite sides of the rink.  The judges announce their names, like """"White Bread"""" or """"Whole Wheat""""
 2. The judge starts the countdown, and the two contestants begin to rostle.
 3. A combination of moves are necessary to be effective in this sport, and there are two ways to do it. Finesse or power.  In finesse, one must use many holds and twists.  If one is quick, it greatly increases the chance of success in the match.  In power, one often uses his strength to throw his opponent to the ground.  Both techniques are very effective.  No punching or kicking is allowed
 4. The way to win is to force the opponent to tap out.  There are many ways to do this, the main point is to tire him out, or use the choke hold.
 5. Once the match is finished, the winner is announced by the judges, and they are congratulated.

That, is how you play a match of rostling.

"If you're talking about the standard of joining gangs to overpower the bias of other gangs, I do not agree to that standard.  The standard I follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it.  When a gang subverts that process by purposefully making articles worse as punishment or to serve a personal agenda, I tell them how I feel to their face.  Doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.
I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.  It's all within the rules of a system where there is no accountability for power, but it is in direct conflict to our humanity and what we know to be right.  I am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that I have never had to compromise.

For too long we have though about Weekly Shōnen Jump as a harmless childrens' manga magazine. For too long we have failed to recognize Weekly Shōnen Jump for what it actually is: a terrorist organization. Through research and hard work I have uncovered a vast conspiracy theory to make today's children violent and aggressive by carrying themes of violence and aggression in Weekly Shōnen Jump. Weekly Shōnen Jump is the cancer of society and promotes violence, aggression, rape and terrorism. Weekly Shōnen Jump is not innocent as you think, it is a vast conspiracy to KILL OFF WESTERN CULTURE. Weekly Shōnen Jump wants to DESTROY religion and peace and start a massive world war. Weekly Shōnen Jump is evil. Weekly Shōnen Jump is nothing but a cover for the world's criminals and terrorists. Weekly Shōnen Jump is vile and corrupt.

The opponent calling me hysterical did so when I had not posted anythiing at all so you should read the page again, what is written in capital letter was inserted long after the texts previous to it and after it had been written, so you can see that he is asking for my banishment for no reasons at all.
I have not being editing ANYTHING AT ALL on this site and you know that.
YBM has been editing all my writtings on it from the beginning also those of a user called Laurence but you never noticed it and do not blame him for that WHY? does he have the right to do it or are you just YBM himself?
I don't see why you are talking about people who cannot read french as all I read is written in english and the links you talk about show a webside with links in it to the same contain in english and in german. Things you will know if you had consulted them instead of attacking me.
You talk about yelling I am attackt for no reason and have to be subject to punishments which I do not deserve, and that you impose on me unjustified.
All the reason you evoce her do not exist.
I do not have edit anyone but my own texts.
I write in english
My links show a place written in 3 different languages.
Links shown by other also show french web site in french like fr. physic and there is links on the french site about the bogdanov affair who show web site in english, so what you are saying is rabbish, and od not constitute an excuse for expulsion but are low argumentation to show an excuse to through me out, exactly as YBM did.
The links i showed are not a web site about the bogdanov but about Voyer and YBM who act as a prove that the motives of YBM in that affair are not to conduct a scientific evaluation of the theory advanced by the Bogdanov, but a social experiment about manipulation of the masses and of evidences, as it is described in the web site which links are available in my column. Another link show what Voyer and YBM did to 2 other writers, a man ans a woman, previously to that affair, and show that he used of exactly the same tool as for this one, and that he stopped doing it when he begin to take care of the Bogdanovs affair. He is insulting the writters abondantly and even show the cover of their books with the title """"de la merde!"""" made in such a way to appear like if it was its real title.
I would like you to come forword with prove that I edited somebody text 'cause I dont see any.
As for your 2 texts above I do not see what is the problem with them so explain yourself.
What do you mean by threat? what kind of threat?
I do read on YBM column a threat to get me banished and a threat to get me ignored and a threat to deleete all my texts no matter what I write with links to wiki revert function, which is illegal by wikis rules, and a threat to get presented as a vandaliser of the site with a link to do it, even so I did not have written a word about it.
What do you mean I am not talking about the subject? Where?
I am firmly keeping the subject: there is no error what so ever in the Bogdanovs book and in their thesis, there is no attempt on their part at lying or at making a bluff out of science, there is people who pretend to be what they are not and pretend to detain evidences of something they barely understand, and who constantly insult the Bogdanovs and anyone who do not have the same opi8nion as they have, who insult the Bogdanovs famili, teachers, physical appearence, life, friends, constantly and in many forum of the internet.
This person is YBM and his associate are: Romnulphe, Voyer, rayon-z, and Max, and their name are to be followed every time YBM appear on a site about the subject.
There is plenty of links about it.
The Bogdanov have already discussed and rediscussed each and every point of the list of so called errors presented by those pseudo scientist, and have proven them wrong and other scientist have intervene too to explain how it had to be understood in theoretical physic, but yBm keep using them as if Igor had never argumented against it, and even do it in a way as if it was because he couldn't argue against it, even a fiew blog after he had got an all explaination about it.
It just doesn't make sens.
He always provocate people by personnal attacks and then reproach them to don't stick to the subject.
Thats a clear line in all his appearences on the net.
A specialist in theoritical science has once demonstrate to him how it hang together and explained each of the points he had listed, but even with that who was a perfect demonstration, he answered: I don't give a shit about it, and even if you prove me wrong on all points, I will continue anyway! he says that on fr. physic, and i put the link to it here and on the french wiki about the bogdanovs.

Here is the content of the Monoplane article from Britannica.  It's not an initial.
Monoplane,  type of aircraft with a single pair of wings. The monoplane design has been nearly universally adopted over multiplane configurations because airflow interference between adjacent wings reduces efficiency. The first monoplane was constructed by the Romanian inventor Trajan Vuia, who made a flight of 12 m (40 feet) on March 18, 1906. Louis Blériot of France built a monoplane in 1907 and flew it across the English Channel two years later.

 Merging Red Hand of Doom and Reliability issue 

Given that there's not alot of information regarding RHoD I'm not sure I agree that it deserves it's own article. Given that I do think it belongs in Wikipedia, and suggest merging and redirecting it with a new article on other similarly-themed D&D; modules. This would have the advantage of 1) allying yourself with other editors with articles in this category, and 2) being able to gather all the secondary sources in one place to address notability concerns. I was thinking about this last night and had the idea that it could fit with 3rd edition modules with a generic setting. That would be a pretty good list of modules; take a look at List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures, and we should be able to gather a good number of secondary sources. I'd be happy to put in work on this. 

Also I'd like to get the issue of whether or not some of the secondary sources being used by D&D; editors that the deletionists view as """"fansites"""" are indeed reliable sources. I'll be happy to put in the work or collaborate on this if you would gather up a list of the disputed sources you have been using. I think other people, such as user:webwarlock, might be interested also. We could submit the case to wp:Reliable sources/Noticeboard and then notify Jack and Gavin so they can see what's going on and make their own arguments. If it can't be resolved there then we can kick it up to informal mediation by the mediation cabal.

Speedy deletion of Phillip saul
 A tag has been placed on Phillip saul requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. —  (say whaaat?!)

"The speed at which the aircraft will fly is lower, but it may take more time to reach that speed because of the extra drag. The change in distance depends on the specific aircraft, as will the amount of flap the manufacturer would recommend for takeoff. If it lacks power - such as a loaded Cessna 172, the amount of flap deflection suggested for takeoff will be very small, and more proficient pilots have been known to accelerate without flaps, then lower them when they have reached the flaps down flying speed.
Had they used full flaps all the way, the extra drag would reduce acceleration so that it would take longer to reach even the lower speed now needed. On aircraft with more power, more flap deflection is possible, always balancing the additional drag with the reduction in acceleration.

Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours.

Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not.

"""-A VERY DISTURBING STATEMENT

Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one:
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/reich1.htm
 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/leuven/
 
Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and """"fuck others"""" as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others.
It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism.
YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of """"mass communication"""" and a weapon to convince anyone of anything.
 
I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle.
 
I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years.
Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov.
 
No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed.
 
Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met?
They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions.
 
I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology.
I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.  On a more general way and even more central here, our power to distinguish between agreeing to a given opinion based on facts, and being manipulate in doing so for all the wrong reasons.
 
This information compleete the picture and gave it its true mening, even if it is by showing how meningsless a huge part of this affair was.

Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to utilize the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

"Another point to be examined, regarding the controversial interpretations of the NY Times story is the interpretation of this key paragraph, where Picard's name is mentioned, along with two other scientists:

The unspoken and unexamined implication or assumption in the disputed section of this biography is that scientists such as Tour, Picard, and Skell are accurately described by the DI's claim that they are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin and also supporters of the DI's political agenda, deserving negative publicity for taking such a laughable position.  Did Chang intentionally put that paragraph into his story to affirm the DI's characterization of those three scientists?  Or did Chang put that paragragraph into the story to cast doubt in the reader's mind on the DI's incredulous claim that all signers adhered to the DI's characterization of the signers?

Given that Chang reported both the DI's claims and the string of quotes revealing a mix of support and disdain among the petition signers, a neutral point of view requires that anyone reading Chang's article with a critical eye would ask the obvious question:  Is the reader supposed to take at face value the DI's naked claim that scientists such as those three are anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda?  Or is the reader supposed to take that paragragh as startling evidence that the claims of the DI stretch credulity.

The way the article is written, a casual reader could draw either conclusion.  A skeptical or fair-minded reader could also draw the conclusion that no firm conclusion can be drawn as to whether any of the signers fit the DI's characterization of them as anti-evolution dissenters from Darwin who support the DI's political agenda.

What conclusion did the various Wikipedia editors draw, and how do they justify treating any such conclusion as an established fact for the purpose of crafting authentic biographies of figures such as Tour, Picard, or Skell?",0

 Incorrect ambiguous name 

OK guys, the list is interesting and important, but it's name is ambiguous for following reasons:
encyclopedically, not all former Soviet republics joined CIS. Some of the CIS members are going to withdraw from the Commonwealth. But all of them certainly do use (or maybe modernize) military aircraft, mostly those Soviet-designed. Thus, the name is unadequately narrowing the subject
practically, CIS is not a purely military organization (or rather mostly non-military). Moreover, some of its members never joined th CIS military institutions and are seeking NATO membership. That's why CIS definition has little in common with military aviation equipment.

So I suggest to rename the article to """"List of military aircraft of the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet countries"""". Other thoughts? """,0

Hi John.  In answer to your question about why the UPenn study is inappropriate for the article, I'm reposting a quote from WP:MEDRS: """"any given primary source [such as this study] may be contradicted by another, and the Wikipedia community relies on the guidance of expert reviews, and statements of major medical and scientific bodies, to provide guidance on any given issue."""" 
When I first read  statement, """"We do not use primary sources to refute secondary ones,"""" I was pretty confused.  I mean, primary sources are more fundamental, right?  Well, the idea is just that when the """"secondary source"""" is a systematic review or the like, what that means is that the secondary source has looked at the all primary sources and evaluated their significance and rendered a scientific judgment.  The authors of the secondary source are better able to interpret the primary sources, not only because they are collecting those sources and considering them in the context of all the available evidence, but because those authors are experts in their fields.  We should expect that they understand the data better than we do, or, at the very least, better than the average reader.  Interpreting primary sources is challenging, and when the experts have already done it for us, there is no reason to foist that responsibility on the average reader. 
From my perpsective, the issue of whether it's a press release or a peer reviewed article quoted to describe the UPenn/Philadelphia study is more or less a red herring.  That study is just a single study, and we should trust the public health experts to render judgment rather than ourselves or the readership. I hope this helps answer your question.   """,0

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

Holocaust
I don't know of any detailed comparison between American use of reservations and the Nazi policy of the """"Final Solution"""". It's quite commonplace to point out that the general concept of """"manifest destiny"""" and the displacement of the original population by """"superior"""" Europeans was part of a widespread social-darwinist model at the end of the nineteenth century that provides a model for the Nazi idea of lebensraum. There was a these written on that as far back as 1950: Frank Parrella, “Lebensraum and Manifest Destiny: A Comparative Study in the Justification of  Expansionism” . There's also Reginald Horsman, Race and Manifest Destiny. Ward Churchill makes comparisons between lebenraum and American attitudes to Indians in his books, notably A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas.   """,0

"Warning 

Hi.  You recently posted the following on my wall:

For the last time, please stop revert warring. Users who persistently revert to their preferred version of the article may be blocked from editing for disruption. In particular, there exists the three revert rule: except in case of vandalism or other purely disruptive edits, a user may not revert the same article more than three times within 24 hours. (You have violated this rule, so I strongly recommend you to stop editing the page altogether and take the issue to the talk page. Otherwise, I am going to report you at the revert warring noticeboard.)

Emphasis mine.  Now, I have to say that I'm rather baffled, because if you've actually read what it is that I've been removing, it is surely completely obvious that the content in question is not encyclopedic material, but rather a highly selective and biased viewpoint - ie that a majority of people in a certain political party favour a certain political point of view.  You will notice that I haven't been touching the section immediately above it which details the actual political parties which have officially come out against AV, since that is a matter of fact and has been presented in a properly factual way.

So what's there to say on the talk page?  The other editor is clearly vandalising the article by repeatedly distorting it to present his own political viewpoint (I notice you haven't warned him though for editing the same article more than three times within 24 hours) and I, in line with the principles you yourself gave me, am cleaning it up.",0

P.S. In response to 'canvassing': I think such accusations are, once again, biased. We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it, but nothing happens, because she is supporting the status quo. Canvassing for the status quo=acceptable. Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I'm being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn't know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field. Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia, but society itself.

Finally again, FYO I am more than two, but slightly less than three, standard deviations above the 'average' IQ, and therefore I see fit to say that I, like Michael C Price, and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society. Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average, we can still see the groundwork of 'one' order of magnitude higher. Of course, an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user, so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system, which I see as having quite many flaws. I do hope that these types of 'essays' will lead to 'constructive' improvements in the future.

Krishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. 

Nabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style
Babukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.

From this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.

Babukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. 

So it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. 

Though the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. 

Babukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. 

As a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band """"Birds"""", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate"""" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.""""GYPSYINDIA"""" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.

""":::Even during the 1891 census, castes like Vilakkithalavan and Veluthedan were counted separately. 90% of the Nairs counted in 1891 belonged to the Kshatriya divisions. The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them """"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas"""". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them """"Nagara Kshatriyas"""" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. 

However the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four """"Suryavanshi"""" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). 

Regarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don't think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no """"conversion of caste"""". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added """"Nair"""" or """"Pillai"""" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.

What I was saying in this section, that was the limiting factor, for it didn't discuss non-city demographics.

There is no free speech on Wikipedia?
You are nuts, there is a lot of freedom of speech in the US and you abide to that.
You can't just make a law that will prevail over the US constitution. Unless you are willing to rewrite the bill of rights, for that we have to kill Dr MLK jr. again.
You allowed this computer hacker Pablo something, located overseas, probably in some garage in a little town in a country called argentina to ignore, laugh at our bill of rights.
He censored my contributions, probably he could not even understand what was in those, his command of the language is just poor, you allowed him to show how powerful he is.
No freedom of speech on wikipedia, and i am sure our fathers have fainted back there in Philadelphia after that statement.
This pablo does not need to worry about the us constitution, the bill of rights or anything like that, probably he does not even care about the bill of rights of his own country.
He can do as he pleases and block the freedom of speech of any US citizen at will.
His intrusion in our territory shall not be tolerated, he can do as he pleases in his country but in ours, he just can't.
I strongly recommend in order to preserve the little prestige left for wikipedia you don't allow this overseas people what you allow them to do.
I see now why he thought the law was a threat, probably it is back there, here is some precious possession of ours that did cost blood and we shall defend it.
I emailed the Attorney General, but i doubt this pablo even knows where california is.
Now that i know his whereabouts i think his connections with carrio are closer than what i thought.

Another response from Jmk

Thank you for finally looking into this.  Do you think I would be so adamant if I had something to hide vis a vis the clone/impersonation issue?  I will be very curious to see what your findings show, as I have my suspicions, but I will keep them to myself for now.  As I have repeatedly stated, the *only* anonymous edits I made were after my editing privileges were blocked, and then only to correct misinformation in the Farmer article, all of which has since been re-inserted by Wyss herself.  You're right, all I wanted was accuracya simple review of my very first post to Wyss' talk page will show (despite my improper posting etiquette, for which I have repeatedly apologized) that all I asked her to do was fact-check.

I am well aware of the Rashomon like qualities of attempting to discern the truth about Frances Farmer.  That indeed is why the subtitle to my article """"Shedding Light on Shadowland"""" is indeed called The Truth About Frances Farmer.  That in turn is why my research has been used by A&E; Biography, NPR, the Washington Post, and, hilariously, the magazine Wyss apparently thinks discredits me, 'American Atheist.'  If you read Conrad Goeringer's article in 'American Atheist' you will find that I am his major source of information and, indeed, there is a whole secondary article about me and my findings vis a vis the false lobotomy allegations.

What bothers me about all of this is not the block (though Wyss says it's easy to get rescinded, I have yet to receive even a hint of how to do that, but that truly is not important to me), but Wyss' repeated assertions that I have sinister motives and, more importantly, have cloned her ID and/or impersonated her.  In terms of my motives, I have for over 20 years worked diligently to rid the world of misinformation about Frances Farmer, and I have been lauded internationally in the press and broadcast media for my attempts.  How is that sinsister?  In terms of the cloning/impersonation, what more can I say?  I have asked repeatedly for someone to do something technical to prove I didn't do it.

It seems that Wyss has had frequent run-ins with others, and perhaps I am the unwitting recipient of some pent-up frustration on her part.  As I have come to surmise, I am probably at least twice as old as most of you, and I am willing to cut you """"kids"""" (joke) some slack, but I want these false allegations to stop and I am asking again for someone to do an IP trace and consclusively state publicly to Wyss and everyone involved that I had nothing to do with this clone ID/impersonation affair.""",0

 Some  Wikipedia  """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum 

This section is taken out from the propaganda web page of the MPLA Peoples Party (Communist Party).
Looking at the dates there is no chance that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos could have gone to Russia for a Oil Engineer Degree. Also the MPLA official web page does not mentions any such degree as well. Taking into consideration that this would be considered a major achievement it seems odd to say the least that the MPLA Comrades Totalitarian Party have """"forgotten"""" to mention this intellectual and academic achievement of their murderous and deep ignorant leader.

But in wikipedia from (night to day) """"voila"""" Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos (a son of a Sao Tome brick layer) could not have gone to Russia or Timbuktu for a degree, as it was economical impossible to him to afford such studies. 

People in Angola who are still alive knew personally this communist and murderous pig, as having only two shirts and only a couple of suits, how could this criminal afford to go to Russia for his Engineer degree, and if he had been there and made his degree (3 to 4 years minimum) then there is no time in the description of his activities and exiled years in Congo Brazzaville.

From the MPLA Web Site: """"Após a eclosão da luta contra a ocupação colonial, em 4 de Fevereiro de 1961, José Eduardo dos Santos, então com 19 anos, abandonou em Novembro desse mesmo ano o país e passou a coordenar no exterior a actividade da Juventude do MPLA(organismo de que é um dos fundadores). Integrou em 1962 o EPLA (Exército Popular de Libertação de Angola), participando na preparação das condições para a abertura da 2ª Região Político-Militar. Em 1963 foi o primeiro representante do MPLA em Brazzaville/ Congo. Nesse mesmo país, depois de terminados os seus estudos superiores, frequentou durante um ano um curso Militar de Telecomunicações, que o habilitou a exercer, de 1970 a 1974, sucessivamente as funções de Operador do Centro Principal de Comunicações da Frente Norte e Responsável-adjunto dos Serviços de Telecomunicações na 2ª Região Político-Militar do MPLA (Cabinda). Em 1974, José Eduardo dos Santos é designado membro da Comissão Provisória de Reajustamento da Frente Norte, responsável das Finanças da 2ª Região, e desempenha novamente as funções de Representante do MPLA em Brazzaville, até Junho de 1975.""""

http://web.archive.org/web/20100828013436/http://www.mpla-angola.org/opresidente.php

So lets hope that common sense sinks in, and that we can see what is obvious, and lets not allow the good nature on which the Wikipedia project was founded and based to be a place where totalitarian communist regimes use this space and wikipedia inadvertently is perceived as a tool to validate their Regimes, we therefore as freemen and humans, we must not allow this space to be used with the aim to prize this (or other) criminal murderous Communist Dictator.

May the light of wisdom illuminate our minds,

Celebrity side dish: John Malkovich brushes Bernie Madoff off of his shoulders
Tom Hanks' films are helping us 'Buck' up through tough times
He’s one of journalism’s most beloved and respected men, but someone appears to have it in for Tom Brokaw. 
Look up the former NBC News anchor on Wikipedia and you’ll find a review of his Emmy-winning reports, his best-selling books, his 20 honorary degrees. Until recently, you also would have found this sentence: 
“He had been married to Meredith Lynn Auld (a former Miss South Dakota and author) from 1962 until 2007, when an alleged affair between Brokaw and Diane Sawyer ended their marriage.”
The Brokaws’ marriage is very much intact (a Google image search shows them arm in arm at events throughout 2008 and 2009). Likewise, ABC News’ Sawyer remains happily married to director Mike Nichols.
A rep for Brokaw said he “burst out laughing” when he heard about the supposed affair. Contacted in the arctic reaches of Finland, Sawyer sent back word through her rep that, “as cute as Tom is, she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the icebreaker she’s traveling on.”
The purported affair, anonymously added to Brokaw’s bio on Feb. 27, was deleted after five days. Wikipedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh tells us the post “would constitute a ‘vandal edit’” but doubted the vandal could be found.
“It’s an open system,” says Walsh. “People may use it to exert their views. But the biographies of living people are most scrutinized by our volunteer editors. It’s incumbent on the Wikipedia Foundation to make sure they’re accurate.”
Walsh surmised that “someone with some agenda” was behind the post. Or maybe there’s more than one person. Clicking on the discussion page of Brokaw’s bio reveals attempts to slip in digs about his accent and personality. Wiki watchdogs rejected the insults, though not the unflattering picture of the newsman, which reminded one reader of “Clint Eastwood saying, ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’ ”
The effort to smear Brokaw recalls the anonymous Wiki attack in 2005 on former assistant attorney general John Seigenthaler Sr., who, it was falsely claimed, masterminded the assassinations of both John and Bobby Kennedy.
Brokaw isn’t the only newsman targeted by Wiki vandals. “Some of our correspondents have stalkers who constantly post falsehoods,” says a source at another network news department. “We’ve had Wikipedia block posts from repeat offenders.”
But the unflappable Brokaw isn’t calling for any investigations. Through his rep he said, “This is beneath comment.”

Hi,

I deleted your recent comment on my talk page because I considered it to be rude. The loss of a chance to debate the technical issues you raised was a shame. I think we are both trying to improve matters of style. Furthermore, we appear to agree on many of those matters.

I am copying your comments to wp:mosnum so that the substantive issues that you raised can be debated more widely. That seems to be me to be a good place. See you there.  

How ironic. I considered it rude of you to dismiss a constructive suggestion on the basis that doing things the right way was too difficult and slow for you. Like I said, you'd rather do a half-assed job because it's quicker and easier than doing it properly. In future, expect your edits to be rolled back summarily - your dismissive attitude deserves to be reciprocated.  """,0
"I also support Finno-Ugric mythologies as a plural term, because there is no just one mythology or system of myths, but different and  diverse Finno-Ugric mythologies. Some kind of an analogy for this is how we name the groups of languages; we do not speak of (common) Finno-Ugric language, but Finno-Ugric languages (plural). Baltic-Finnic mythology is still acceptable as a singular term, because Baltic-Finnic mythologies share very much with each other. Kalevala, for example, is collected from speakers of different baltic Finnic languages. But there could not be an opus of Fenno-Ugric or Fenno-Volgaic mythology; it would just be a mess of unrelated material and languages that are not mutually intelligible.  puhu",0

 Mention of The Gun  

The Sandman's gun was considered to be an unusual and ground breaking invention in the 1960s when the book was published and has had possible influences on Judge Dredd (see above).

I mentioned this in a section entitled The Gun but another editor removed it citing that it was trivial.

I disagree as the main plot of the novel in both this book and the sequel Logan's World, focuses on how terrified Runners are of this weapon and in particular the threat of being shot at with a Homer. 

The Gun provides key plot elements in the novel (e.g. Logan killing the tiger towards the end, his inability to kill Jessica with it at the novel's close, the Gun going """"wild"""" as they race for Sanctuary and Logan using the power cell to find a way out of the cave they are trapped in). 

The Gun is also something that saves his life on many occasions and on two separate instances alerts other people to who he really is (Doc in The New You and Jessica when he kills the Cub Scouts).

I believe such a crucial backbone to the novel deserves its own sub section, especially when it has as much impact on the story as Logan, Jessica or Ballard/ Francis do.""",0
"Kennett went to Greenland and detected nanodiamonds, they were contested on the basis that there were not hexagonal nanodiamonds with claims that only lonsdaleite is indicative of impacts. Further research has refuted that claim, and nanodiamonds are not delivered in situ, they are created in the impact. In fact further research has concluded that the nanodiamonds are a mix of cubic, hexagonal, new previously unknown polymorphs and always accompanied by a mix of carbon sheet polymorphs, that transition nearly continuously to nanodiamond. The Madden found nanodiamonds in the sediments in Oklahoma, and completely independent secondary result that you insisted on deleting from the reference list. Now Kennett finds nanodiamond at half the sites, and studies them extensively. This has moved well beyond the primary into the tertiary.

Plagiarism?

This source, which is from Medieval Italy: an Encyclopedia,""""  ed. Christopher Kleinhenz, has been plagiarized, or nearly so, in a version of this article. Take this old version of the article as a reference point, and compare the following (emphasis added by me):

Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro (born circa 1300, died 1342) was from Sansepolcro near Arezzo. (Wikipedia)
Dionigi (c. 1300–1342) was born in Sansepolcro, near Arezzo. (Medieval Italy)

He was an Augustinian scholar of very keen intellect and was much sympathetic towards others. (Wikipedia)
He entered the Augustinian order at a young age and immediately distinguished himself by his keen intellect and piety. (Medieval Italy)

Dionigi was a scholar trained as an astrologer in Sorbonne as well as a theologian. He received his doctorate circa 1324. (Wikipedia)
He studied theology at the Sorbonne in Paris and received his doctorate c. 1324. (Medieval Italy)

One of Dionigi's works (which since has been lost) is his commentary (circa 1339–1342) on Valerius Maximus’s Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri. (Wikipedia)
Almost all of Dionigi’s own writing has been lost. His most
famous work is his commentary (probably c. 1339–1342) on
Valerius Maximus’s Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri. (Medieval Italy)

It became a template for subsequent commentaries on Valerius Maximus and also for several of Boccaccio’s reference works such as Esposizioni and Genealogia deorum gentilium.  (Wikipedia)
This commentary, with its many citations of classical authors, became a template not only for subsequent commentaries on
Valerius Maximus but also for several of Boccaccio’s nonfictional works, such as Esposizioni and Genealogia deorum gentilium. (Medieval Italy)

Another of Dionigi’s writings is a commentary on the first book of the Sententiae (a treatise on logic) and still another is a commentary on the pseudo Aristotelian Oeconomia'. (Wikipedia)
 Dionigi’s other writings include a commentary on the first book of the Sententiae, a treatise on logic, and a commentary on the pseudo-Aristotelian Oeconomia. (Medieval Italy'')

And that's just the first two paragraphs of that version of the WP article. In my opinion, this is a clear-cut case of plagiarism and a violation of copyright. Some of this remains in the article, some has been altered; but there's obviously a larger concern of whether there are other instances of plagiarism in the article. I'm not sure how to proceed.

I'm not alone believing this was not a case of outing, and making unproven allegations of misconduct, in this case outing, is also a form of personal attack designed to undermine the other editor, and Offliner has been warned in the past not to file such vexatious claims. Offliner is a veteran of filing complaints on WP:AE, and if this comes under WP:DIGWUREN (and Kuril Islands dispute seems to fall outside of the scope of that case being Eastern Europe), he should know that board would have been the more appropriate place to lodge that complaint, but perhaps he wouldn't have achieved the same result.

If you ever change your minds...

Original to Leo Kinahan, counsel for Sgt. Jim Cassells

Mr. Kinahan:

Having discovered how sensitive you are about your e-mail address, note that I have included you as a BCC to protect your privacy. As I have been battling with the media ever since my saga began, I am only including them, at this time, in the hope that - considering the recent brave actions of your client and the resultant headlines which have followed - they may, finally, be forced to recognize my plight and resultant complaint since it all began.

As briefly as I can describe it, I was set up by 55 Division in November of ' 98 with a manufactured charge of Criminal Harassment as a favour to their local coffee hangout in my then-neighbourhood, to obviate potential civil litigation I had against it and the parent chain, Second Cup Ltd..Come trial the following year and representing myself, I went to court with 39 witnesses, several exculpatory documents and more. 

As a result of my actions and an airtight defence, the """"complainant"""" - who had been sexually servicing at least one 55 cop (John Maciek) - and two of my defence witnesses associated with the coffee franchise were paid to, respectively, take and avoid the stand.

When this was articulated by myself, the original two arresting officers, Paul Scudds (immediately afterwards appointed by Fantino to Internal Affairs, itself) and Sheila Richardson, attempted to smash through my door without cause or warrant, causing me to secure counsel, ostensibly for my own protection, in the person of Lorne Honickman.

Where I lose all of the media, in their zeal to protect one of their peers, is the fact that Honickman took a bribe from Second Cup CEO  Michael  Bregman to throw the trial and protect their """"good name"""", which resulted in his: excluding every one of my witnesses; ordering transcripts to be altered by a Ministry of the A.G. court reporter - who then bailed on both her employer and her apartment and went into hiding, along with her sister/fellow A.G. employee, who resided elsewhere; refusing to admit documents and evidence to prove my innocence and more.

After dismissing Honickman - but still having to return to court to continue the trial - I received a phone call, at home, on Friday, January 7, 2000, from 55's John Graham, informing me that I would not make it to College Park alive with the evidence of all that I put before you now.

Thirty-six hours later, just after 10:00 a.m. on January 9, the threat was made good when a dozen cops from the division assembled themselves outside my door - armed with billy clubs, black leather """"beater"""" gloves and cell phones - with the stated intention (taped phone messages retrieved after my too-narrow escape) of killing me.

Since then, I have run the entire gamut of the complaint system, including three cops I was publicly handed to by Fantino at his precious """"Town Hall"""" meetings: Stu Eley, Wayne Cotgreave and Mike Trimble ( stu.eley@torontopolice.on.ca, wayne.cotgreave@torontopolice.on.ca,  mike.trimble@torontopolice.on.ca).

Prior to - and after - this, upon my own initiative, were Bryce Evans (bryce.evans@torontopolice.on.ca), Dave Mcleod (dave.mcleod@torontopolice.on.ca) and Steven Pipe (steven.pipe@torontopolice.on.ca); all of whom have had the displeasure - or more, the sadistic pleasure - of dealing with/blowing me off - and who disappeared behind voice mail forever after, as did the others, plus every one of the usual suspects in Pro Standards ( jane.wilcox@torontopolice.on.ca, john.knaap@torontopolice.on.ca,  rick.gauthier@torontopolice.on.ca)  that I was referred to and others, including Scott Gilbert of 55 Division     (scott.gilbert@torontopolice.on.ca), whom I was forced to cooperate with by the OCCOPS and provided a gruelling, eight hour video taped statement, only to have same outright ignored - and my complaint dismissed - by the latter.

During your client's original investigation, I actually contacted  RCMP Supt. John Neily and asked him to include my situation in the mix, as Fantino was bleating about rooting out """"perjury and corruption"""" (I was subject to both during my trial) and we cooperatively communicated for eighteen months, only to have - come the moment of truth -  Neily regretfully inform me that he'd been ordered to drop my case.

I am confused here.  I posted something about both of the publically funded Waldorf schools in Sonoma County, not an 'individual school,' and that information comes from official sources (so it is properly sourced), and the information provides information which contradicts the 'Official' Waldorf position.  I do not believe that the 'official' statement of the Waldorf committee reflects their reality.  Anti-immunization is so highly correlated with the Waldorf schools I have looked at as to be close to official policy.  Waldorf schools in the US  education as practiced in the US includes a substantial anti-immunization    

 Concerns over immunizations 

The current text refers to a 'consensus statement' which is a dead link.  This page http://www.waldorfanswers.org/QuestionsMore.htm refers to a growing anti-immunization movement within and outside of Waldorf schools, but again refers to the same dead link as the 'consensus statement' on vaccinations.

The article does not cite a verifiable source on the policy of Waldorf education towards vaccinations.  The article does say """"Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an """"anthroposophic lifestyle"""" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination""""  Which is a deep violation of NPOV - to assert a correlation when there is a deep selection bias in the cited studies.

I will replace the immunization section with something sourced unless it is properly sourced.""",0

I really think that you did a great job with this page. There is a large emphasis on application throughout the wiki which has its strengths given the audience. I do think that there are a fe sentence structure issues and some material that would be nice to add. You are the expert in this  stuff so please take my advice, with respect to the content, with a grain of salt.

Introduction
I like the points that you address, as far as versatility and challenges in design. One thing that I think needs a little work is the sentence structure. I noticed that the opening sentence is a hard to read. There is a lot of good stuff in it, but I think that it could be broken up a little bit. I think that the first sentence can be broken up into three different sentences addressing the purpose and challenges in application and decomposition. As it reads it is just a little hard to follow. Also the term breakdown is used several times, and I was wondering if the term decomposition could be used interchangeably. Overall I think that the intro hits all the areas that it should, and the content is good. I do think that it need a little restructuring though.

History
I really found the history of these polymers to be interesting. I think your decision to make history a section was a good choice given the natural quality of a lot of these polymers. One thing that I did not like about the history section in the opening two sentences. I understand what you are trying to say, but I think there may be better ways to say that biodegradable polymers have a been around for a while. If you remove the two sentences I think it would be more fluid. I really like how you covered a large timespan. It is easy to get wrapped up in what is cutting edge, but I think you did a really good job covering as much time as possible and pointing out many things. Nice! 

Structure and properties
This section was really nice. I really like the scheme that you have in the beginning. One nit picky thing I want to point out, is that think that there is a repeat in the first sentence of ester and ester bonds. Also in the first sentence you mention that some of polymers, such as proteins, contain amide bonds.  I think a nice addition to the scheme next to biopolyesters would be biopolyamides and a following box labelled peptides. I notices that you mention it in the next section and it may be a good place to show it in your scheme. I really like the properties section of your article, you address a lot of challenges with respect to degradation.  Another nit picky thing, I think the term impractical  in the third sentence could be changed to something more science like. 

Synthesis
This is section is great. I printed the article off to read it and as I was reading I thought """"They should really include a scheme for polyurethanes."""" and wah la! On the next page at the top there is a scheme for polyurethanes, so what I am trying to say is good placement. 

Mechanism of Breakdown
Another great section. One thing I think you both need to decide on is whether you are going to use the term breakdown, degradation, or decomposition. I see them all throughout, I am not sure which one is more right, but I think that you should agree on one and use it throughout. In the second paragraph there seems to be an error in your wiki language. There is the word oxygen that looks like this: [[oxygen[[. In the paragraph following your scheme, there is a sentence explaining the challenges for enzymes to evolve to accommodate the synthetic polymers. I there really like it and I think it is full of information. Although, I think that this sentence is crucial, I also think that it could be worded better. In this same paragraph there is a sentence that starts with:""""Typically, after physical processes......"""" There seems to be some extra words and the sentence does not quite make sense. 

Applications 
Application section is really nice. I think that medicinal application for these is really interesting and I also think that most people will find this intriguing. I think your section is weighted toward medicinal applications, and I think that is awesome. Now the stuff I thought that could be changed: I think that the first sentence of the second paragraph could be removed completely and the paragraph would be fine. In the third paragraph there is a sentence where you use the term in vitro twice. I think that second usage could be removed. Also, I got a little confused in the example sentence about rat smooth muscle tissue. I really like the term """"holy grail"""", not sure if this was intended to be a monty python reference, but it should of been. Although, I like the term holy grail, I think from a professional stance there may be other terms you could use.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good. If Hell is other people, Wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle.   """,1

"""I believe a number of statements from this supplement to WP:OR are relevant to this discussion:
Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.
Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only """"cervical cap"""").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.
Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so """"cervical cap"""" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.

I am not attached to the title of """"cervical cap"""" for this article.  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Lea's Shield into this article, but, like David and Una, I am open to looking for a new name.  Anon, are you willing to consider a merge with a name change?  If so, we can discuss alternatives to """"cervical barrier"""", which you have objected to. Talk     C

Translating interwiki
Thanks, that's great, I just wanted to convey my old thoughts (I was doing that too). Many other wikis have """"featured articles"""", and translating them is quite straightforward (yes, time consuming). One issue is sourcing - we can't trust unreferenced information. Prose might get nicely polished, but the facts could be POVish or plain wrong. Unfortunately, many other wikis don't demand referencing, and I had to research that independently. Cheers.   """,0

There are lots of definitions of terrorism but none of them are """"accepted"""". Every definition is disputed by somebody. That is the reason many news agencies don't label any attacks as terrorist attacks and nor should we. Investigating and adjudicating as to whether a particular incident falls within the US State Department definition of terrorism (for instance) when the State Department itself has not given it's opinion on the subject is most definitely Original research. Remember that an argument can be made that the Boston Tea party could qualify as a terrorist incident under some definitions. That is why I am suggesting we list all notable violent incidents and ongoing conflicts and let our readers decide whether they want to call a particular incident terrorism. This would let us include the 2011 Tucson shooting for instance without having to determine the shooters motive. We could also include incidents like the 2010 Kingston unrest even though that was criminal, rather than political, violence.   """,0

 Speedy Deletion """"Dogsoc"""" as patent nonsense 

Hi Dreadstar
Could you please rehabilitate the """"Dogsoc"""" article you deleted to some private talk space so that we can work with it and convert it to brilliant prose and all the other stuff. Would appreciate a little room / time to work on this one - since it is not patent nonsense although it may appear so at first blush.  

I will reply for Dreadstar, and he can respond  if he needs to. Let me first explain the concept of verifiability, which is a core pillar of Wikipedia. Another thing is notability, which basically means that you can create an acronym about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without citations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc.,), then articles are likely to be deleted. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additionally, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your username is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia's core policies. I'd encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed notability. Cheers! Ariel♥Gold

Thanks Ariel, better get some foot warmers for that poor doggie!   † 

Dogsoc, the article consisted of an acronym and six sentences describing what the acronym meant, none of which was verifiable per WP:Verifiability, and which miserably failed Wikipedia:Notability.  The only claim to verifiability was a presumed """"xerox copy"""" of an """"underground magazine"""" published in 1976 purportedly recently acquired and alleged to be undergoing the """"process of being translated and scanned.""""  The contents of the article, although short, were quite inflammatory, making unfounded accusations against governmental """"regulatory assassins"""", etc.  All in all, it added up to, quite frankly, patent nonsense with no meaningful content.  † 

Dreadstar, Wiki has many articles devoted to acronyms (such as United Nations, United States of America). Referring to the recently acquired document, there is now a stay order of the concerned High Court on publication of this document. We can *Now* cite the judgement's link on an OFFICIAL Govt. High Court website (which ought to meet reputable source /verificability criteria). For DOGSOC notability a simple google (is this verifiable?) news search on """"Nandigram"""" should do. Finally I may mention Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View Policy which is absolutely non-negotiable.  
Dogsoc, you do not seem to have read the links provided to you. You say """"DOGSOC"""" is on Google, but here is the Google search result for DOGSOC  with a total of  one article from 1910, not related to this article you are claiming is notable. The words you said it stands for, """"Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities"""", a Google search comes up with again, nothing:  None of this has anything to do with POV, it has to do with, again, verifiability and reliable, third-party sources that establish the notability. Yes, USA, UN, and many, many other acronyms have pages here, but they are notable, mentioned in the news, media, and other reliable sources. This acronym is not. Further, you may wish to review the single purpose account guide as well. Thanks, Ariel[[Special:C",0

This theory states that the Universe was originally all matter. The theory is based on the fact that a vacuum can only be created when work is done. The exact proportion and density of the original matter is not known. It is only an educated guess that the matter was a gas. The Gas Theory states: 1 Space is infinite = n/1 2 Matter is infinite = n/1 3 Time is infinite 4 Energy is the reactant

n/1 matter + energy = (n/1 space + (1/n matter - energy))

The starting point is theoretical: Matter n/1 + n/1 energy = space n/1/ matter 1/n - n/1 energy “ n/1 over 1/n “ equals an """"open proportion"""" an unknown balance. Since the universe is not subject to proportion, all things are technically part of a type of gas.

The Gas Theory

The GAS THEORY states that a GAS in some low density form or equal to or proportional to: 1/infinite times a Helium atom (or any particle). (matter/space-energy) is/was the """"original substance"""". A property-less gas. This gas had POTENTIAL energy. Ironically only because it was substance and had mass.... This GAS was... At a single volume, pressure, and temperature. First the GAS condensed some. Then the GAS developed some properties... 1st, the variation of volume... CREATED the WEAK FORCE from Vacuum/MATTER 2nd, the variation of pressure... CREATED GRAVITATION from condensation/MATTER 3rd, the variation of temperature... CREATED ELECTROMAGNETISM from hot and cold +(P,T,V)/MATTER 4th, friction developed (KINETIC ENERGY)... This CAUSED electrical activity, condensations and... """"Dynamic cosmic relationships"""" A gaseous-energetic cloud of """"Microwave laden matter/energy reactions."""" All these (1-4) CAUSED and CREATED The STRONG FORCE (HIGHLY KINETIC AND CONDENSED MATTER) Which lead to... Spontaneous disintegration's and atomic radiation.

 Re - Silent Films

Sooner or later, they'll all be in GoogleNews/googlebooks; at the very least , for every building erected or planned before 1920. If we're going to hold to the GNG, we have several choices A.  use an increasingly stringent definition of what we consider RSs for WLOCAL  such as requiring regional sources, but that wont have any effect in large cities  B.  Make a special provision about LOCAL requiring more than RSs, such as RSs showing notability in particular ways  C.

Accept the articles, but require substantial content F.  Simply accept the articles . G Use a WikipediaTwo or WikipediaLocal project as a supplement to Wikipedia.    

The GNG was originally adopted as a restrictive measure. This is no longer the case. The increase in easily available reliable web information has killed it's usefulness this way. It is now a rule that will increasingly work the other way around. Many deletionists   try to  elevate it into what they consider a basic policy on principles that are not specifically exclusionary, but rely on confusion of WP:N with WP:V ; many deletionists and others think that in principle it is the only logically  defensible way of having a guideline I wonder whether they will stick with it when it yields the opposite result to what they really want, or yield a result that contradicts their own intuition?

What I really want in G, above, a supplement that will maintain WP:V and WP:NPOV and other foundation principles, but not have a WP:N barrier.

""":::::Rev. Margolin, you are quite correct that LaVey did not originate the term 'satanist', and yet you have yet to demonstrate that LaVey (and his wife, and their comrades) did not invent the religion of Satanism, which was obviously my focus of interest for many moons now. self-ID is not irrelevant as this is one of the criteria for sociological categorization. if you have others, then please explain them.

I do appreciate your attempted summary of a history of Satanism. how did you arrive at the 13th century (1200s) as the time of the origin of Roman Catholicism propaganda using the term? the OED? is your selection of the late 1800s (that leaves at least 600 years of history unmapped!) based on Dashwood or the Taxil Hoax material? absent defining """"Satanism"""" beyond propaganda, i don't see how priests """"caught experimenting with magic or accused of being witches or committing various heresies"""" necessarily represents a 'backfire'. are you maintaining that magical practice and/or the practice of witchcraft/heresies were indicators of the propagandistic 'satanism' of the Roman Catholic Church? if so, and these may be identified, can we run down a list of these identifiers for the 'first part' of Satanism's history (as a tool of religious propaganda)? I don't follow your reference to Richard Ramirez here, or why he is some kind of example of a """"backfire"""" of religious propaganda. is it because he uses the propaganda as a fear-inspirer with the communication of the media?

as regards 'Reverse Christians' or 'Inverse Christians', i don't think that these kinds of beliefs began being called 'Satanism' in any systemic sense until the 20th century as self-applied. if you know differently, please point out some instances, as i would be very interested to learn of the linguistic history.

with regard to this article, it extends off of the Satanism_(disambiguation) page, to whose Talk page you have posted many times, and thus without that disambiguation, it could well become anything associated with the term. if this is your contention, then you ought to be stating this on the previously-mentioned Talk page also so that we can get the disambiguation removed, else more clearly indicating what you want to do, since presently that page says """"Satanism is a catch-all term referring to several religious movements."""" (my bolding) please make up your mind or at least forge an agreement with me about it. ) consider this some kind of 'Satanic' olive branch.

for my part, i suggest that the disambiguation page list the various categories of referent for the term (add to these if you have ideas):
(1) propaganda;
(2) proto-religion in inversion interior to Christianity and de facto statuses;
(3) pop-media circus (under LaVey, if you like);
(4) serious religious extentions (starting with or beyond the Church of Satan, or earlier, if we can document it);
and that we delineate those here. 

I can spearhead the matter either at the disambiguation page or here if you like, and we can map them out. there truly aren't that many of them, and some good portion of the territory is mapped on the disambiguation page right now, possibly needing a slight tweak. please advise as to your preferences and your interests, as we seem the major contributors of duration and appear to be drawing near to consensus. ;)

"""

Hi, thanks for your thoughts. I have to disagree about your disambiguity-argument. You say """"Germany"""" can refer to either """"West Germany"""" or """"East Germany"""". This is - as I already stated - simply not correct, since there never was a country named """"West Germany"""" and there never was a country named """"East Germany"""", they were called those names in foreign media for simplicity reasons, as the """"Federal Republic of Germany"""" was part of the western capitalist world or first world, while the """"Peoples Republic of Germany"""" was part of Eastern bloc, or second world. Still this is not the correct term for the country, and is therefore no phrasing for an encyclopaedia. It is colloquial language that saves time, but still this doesn't make it the correct term. I do not make up names or use other possibly derogatory terms for other countries, and therefore would prefer, if wikipaedia articles are kept in a neutral tone too. So if there is really confusion to avoid, then the only correct way to do so, is to use the complete names of the country, and not some popular slang. To be honest, i didn't think there would be a confusion, and someone might think this final was between the Peoples Republic of Germany and England, and not between the Federal Republic of Germany and England (since the Peoples Republic of Germany only participated in one World Cup anyways). But that's probably me knowing already a lot about this topic and forgetting about people that know little about World Cup history, so i might be wrong. But if others do think the distinction is necessary, then please distinguish the teams with the real names of the country and not colloquial language. Finally i want to point out, that the link to Germany National Footbal Team leads to an article that already explains, that there were temporary governing football associations other than the DFB, so if there really is a confusion which German team this is, a click on the link of the team name will resolve that confusion.

Your second argument is, that """"most sources refer to that team as West Germany"""". That may be right, but is that really the deciding criterion? If i find, that most sources say, that eg Evolution is wrong, and Intelligent Design is right, will that decide the content of a wikipaedia article? I know it's a bad example, and i don't want to provoke a political or offtopic discussion, i just want to make to point that what many people say is not necessarily right. But unlike in discussions about """"most sources say Britney Spears is the best singer of all times"""" this whole thing is not up to taste, political views, scientific surveys, or speculations. It is simply a fact, that the name of the country this team represents is not """"West Germany"""", so it is not right to call the football team that represents this country """"West Germany"""". If you don't believe that this is a fact, then look it up on every government document of the Federal Republic of Germany, the name """"West Germany"""" is never used. And btw: it is not like, there is no source using the proper name of the team. It may not be the majority (i don't know tbh), but i am confident, that i can find a sizeable number of references using the correct term, which will be enough for every passage of this article. German sources use the correct term anyways, i could bombard you with thousands of sources in German language that use """"Germany"""" or """"FRG"""" or """"BRD"""", and not """"West Germany"""". At the end it is the souvereign right of a country to name herself (see also Macedonia vs Greece) and in English the """"Bundesrepublik Deutschland"""" has the official name """"Federal Republic of Germany"""" - or short """"Germany"""" - and has never called herself or referred to itself as """"West Germany"""", or """"Federal Republic of West Germany"""" or any other alteration including geographical terms. And the governing body of German football since 1900, the """"Deutscher Fußballbund"""" which translates into """"German Football Association"""" has never called itself """"West German Football Association"""" or referred to its players as """"West Germans"""". As i have already mentioned above, all Germans were eligble to play, whether they are from east or west or south or north. Even Germans born in other countries are eligible, like Paolo Rink born in Brazil, or Miroslav Klose/Lukas Podolski/Piotr Trochowski born in Poland, or Oliver Neuville born in Switzerland, as long as they have German ancestry. 

It is and was the explicit objective of the DFB to represent all Germans. This is exemplified when the Federal Republic of Germany played in eastern Europe, thousands came from the Peoples Republic of Germany to support the team from the other side of the Iron Curtain. They did that even though the Peoples Republic of Germany over time started penalizing people who support the """"class enemy"""" from across the border.

"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1

Ringerfan23: I just want you to let you know that you appear to alienate a lot of people on Wikipedia. Perhaps the problem can be best summarized by your own comment on this page when you said that you thought about the issue and came to agree with the rest of the group. In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful. When faced with a group of people who reached consensus, you still had the audacity to have the page locked to reflect your (poorly reasoned) point of view. These are the actions of a stubborn child who wants his way and completely contradictory to what Wikipedia is about. I think you should grow up, recognize that your positions are often incorrect, and defer to the democratic process. Seriously, why do you think your opinion is so important that your beliefs should outweigh a consensus?   —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.13.207.186   """,0

Youtube is not a reliable source.  
I agree with Off2riorob.  This picture is very unclear by itself.  It could easily be captioned the other way and no-one would know the difference.    

Which is why it needs context of a proper descriptive caption that explains what is going on. Bless sins, youtube may host the video, but it isn't the source. However, it the video isn't a secondary source, which is why it isn't used for citations.  talk 
You are not making any sense at all..within policy or without policy.   
I'm not talking about policy, I'm just saying that it is pretty obvious what the picture shows. It doesn't mean the caption was the best, but it certainly wasn't factually incorrect.  talk 
That picture is a meaningless shadow puppet show. People can say is it clear what it shows but the picture will always remain a shadow puppet show.

 Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.
 In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka """,0

 Maduro Criticisms and Homophobic Allegations Update 

Maduro claimed that Capriles could be killed by CIA 
Capriles said openly that if he something happens to him, that is it Maduro's doing. 
Maduro on 3/16 shut down an airport that Capriles was using that morning. 
Maduro indicates that he will shut down all """"Comida Rapida"""" or fast food restaurants on VTV on March 24th. 

Maduro states """"I do have a wife, you know? I do like women!"""" Maduro told a rally. He has also called Capriles """"a little princess."""" (sic)

Why title a section called gay rights, when the issue is moreso """"Allegations of Homophobic Comments""""

"Sons of Ali al-Hadi (Imam Ali Naqi)
There is no conclusion over three sons or seven.  Why it is considered necessary to place a full stop after mentioning three sons.  Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of reference being emphasized with the availability of an ISBN # and its publishing in English language by a foreign expert (his dignity is recognized, but critical view is our right).  In my discussion  Abu Mikhnaf is one of primary sources per norm of social science (history).

 Primary sources: relate to an event, written by someone who experienced or witnessed the event in question by  letters, memoirs, journals, speeches, manuscripts, etc.

Secondary sources: function to interpret primary sources.  Secondary sources interpret to assign value and draw conclusions about the events reported in primary sources.
 
When evaluating primary or secondary sources, the very basis warrants to know:
(i)How does the author know these details
(ii) Was the author present at the event or soon on the scene? 
(iii) Where does this information come from, i.e. personal experience, eyewitness, or reports written by others?

Thus the reliability of an scholar (Wilferd Madelung ) belonging to a belated period (20th century) depending on single source of tenth century does not sense to overrule the very old primary source of 8th century  which is not only supported by millions of naqvis/naqavis  of the world (particularly the sub-continent) but also evident from the various published (secondary) sources e.g. Gulzar-e-Naqi (Riaz ulnasab), compiled with the help of 38 books annexing 40 pedigrees, by a family member of Ali Naqi Naqvi .  The writer belongs to well educated family, his two elder brothers were college principals in colleges of  Punjab.  Among his brothers Dr. Sohail Bukhari was an authority in Urdu Literature  in his time besides being an author for Punjab Text Books for school and colleges.

In view of above discussion the section which provides explanation to the confusion in numbering and names of sons should remain in the main article for research and reference, in terms of EN-WP being  the tertiary source.",0

 BUSH AND JFK 

The recent 50th anniversary upsurge in Kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in 2017 has caused many conspiracy theories to be re-examined.  More often GHW Bush's name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy.  His favoring of Nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory, as does the depth of Nixon's corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.

I feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of GHWB's career, especially as both Bush presidents were such avid war-mongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the """"military-industrial"""" influence that Eisenhower warned the nation against.  Bush's attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the Vietnam war.""",0

Too many lies in this para=
In following para, yogindar sikand is a muslim convert and his name is mentioned as Hindu representative. The first statement is a lie as he is not a hindu representative.

Representatives of Hinduism held a variety of views on Muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the Narashansrishi of the Vedas, predicted in the Atharva Veda.[183] One of the prominent Vaishnava proponents, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",0

This assumption, however well-meaning, is not legally sufficient and the tag is being phased out.  Images using it are being deleted.

This image has been tagged for deletion and will be deleted in one week if adequate copyright information is not provided.

If you, personally, are the author of this content, meaning that you took the photograph yourself or you created the chart yourself (and it does not use any clipart that you did not create), please retag the image with a free image copyright tag that correctly describes your licensing intentions, usually  or .  Please also make sure if you have not already done so that you write a good description of what the image depicts, when you took the photo, and other important details.  This will allow Wikipedia to continue using the image.

If you did not create the image or if it is derived from the copyrighted works of others, please keep in mind that most images on the internet are copyrighted and are not suitable for use on Wikipedia.  Wikipedia respects the copyrights of others and does not use images unless we know that they have been freely licensed.  Any creative work is automatically copyrighted, even if it lacks a copyright notice.  Unless the copyright holder has specifically disclaimed their rights to the image and released it under the GFDL or another compatible license, we cannot use it.  If you did not create the image, simply do nothing and it will be deleted in a week.

Yeah, this is pretty much how I see you. I can tell the difference between an editor or admin """"out to get me,"""" a few are on occasion, maybe, and one who is simply dealing with matters as they appear at the moment. Often what I do can be hard to understand; if I'm brief, it's rejected as incoherent, if I explain thoroughly, it's tl;dr. And to explain with the exact balance of brevity and detail is difficult and often time-consuming; that is the best of writing, and it's hard to come by. One of my friends who, in the past, has written on the same topics as I do, but who is far more brief, has said that, sure, he's brief, but I'm more thorough, and it takes him three times as long to write his brief summary (which, I'd say, is typically excellent) as it takes me to write my tome.) Ideally, it takes all kinds to write and edit an encyclopedia; writers *often* are too wordy, besides having points of view, making mistakes, and failing to reference claims, because they are writing from personal knowledge, and that's why they need editors, in real life as well as on Wikipedia. Editors and writers, real-world, are famous for conflict.
On-line interaction is also famous for leading to flame wars, because of the absence of all the cues that allow truly high-bandwidth communication in person, mostly visual: this can't be stuffed into the very narrow channel of text, not even close (much more than a thousand times as much information per second). I've been """"conferencing"""" on-line since the mid-1980s, and it was obvious then. If there is rapport failure, text may be interpreted through a hostile filter; hostile or false meanings can be seen in the text, instead of alternate true or at least neutral meanings. Woonpton has done some reading in my history, and doesn't understand what she read (I think it's she). Others have done the same. If you look at Jehochman's warning to me that was the basis for my block last year, you could see a similarity with Woonpton's conclusions. Iridescent didn't make that the basis of the block, but was clearly thinking the like of it in discussions around the block on her Talk page. I went to the trouble of working it out with Jehochman, first with a userspace self-RfC (an new process, I must say, that should be more used by editors with a complaint about how they have been treated, it was designed to be minimally disruptive; had I been as accused, I'd have been so advised, and I would not have been able to use the self-RfC for anything else), then by approaching Jehochman directly, and, out of that, a very solid working relationship has been formed. it was good even before we met in person. I never did address it with Iridescent, it seemed moot by the time I'd have been ready. Maybe someday. Thanks for dropping by, make yourself at home.

We don't have to stick religiously to the words used in the literature, particularly if, like with these, they are ambiguous in English. We should paraphrase if we need to, especially if it is a literal, rather than a meaning, translation from French as much of this appears to be. I think we need to forge a compromise between what is there now, and something  easier to grasp the true meaning of. I'll offer the following as a starter in this spirit:

Manufacturable and repeatable standards
Example physical standards of the base units used in the metric system capable of being accurately manufactured (known as realisable by the BIPM), ideally with reference to naturally occurring stable physical constants or phenomena rather than to a single existing physical object or artefacts. The BIPM publish a set of instructions for how to manufacture a reference standard for each of the base units. This is known as a mise en pratique in French, the primary language of the BIPM. Where practical at the time, the definitions of the base units were developed so that a suitably equipped laboratory would be able to construct an acceptably accurate reference standard without the need to compare it with an existing physical object, which may not be available locally. In practice, such such realisation is done under the auspices of what is known as a mutual acceptance arrangement (MAA).

 I'm not seeing what points readers to Hotchkiss in popular culture. Please clarify.

If the section is called """"Hotchkiss in Print"""" then maybe movie references are not appropriate here, or the section should be renamed.

As to your point about """"disgruntled alums:"""" Whether the quotations are positive or negative is immaterial. If they are references in print and they shed light on the history and reputation of the school, then the quotations seem entirely appropriate here. Would we want to include every last mention of Hotchkiss in the written record? Perhaps not. However, below are reasons for including quotes I have recently added (actually, re-added because they were removed at some point).

Thomas Hoving quotation: Hoving is one of the more notable alums, a longtime director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a public figure who is also an alum, his perspective on the school is significant. McPhee is also a leading writer of profiles and this piece originally appeared in the New Yorker. So, it's authoritative.

The Cullman quotation: I believe Cullman was chairman of the board of trustees, and the Cullman family has been one of the school's major supporters. Since Cullman is an alumnus and a prominent supporter, his comments on the school are worth noting.

Julian Houston is a judge in Massachusetts. As a successful legal professional, an alumnus, and a person of color, who has written a book that is clearly based on his experience at the school, it is appropriate to quote him on his time at the school.

Archibald MacLeish is among the school's most prominent alumni. Because of his stature, his comments on the school are notable.

Lemisch is both an alumnus and an emeritus history professor, who has written an article on the history of Hotchkiss. Because he is an alum and a historian, and because the subject of this article is the history of the school, a quotation from it is notable.

The above reasons support the relevance of these quotations to this article.

If there are other quotes by prominent alums who enjoyed their time at Hotchkiss, of course those would be worth citing here as well. """,0
"Likewise Hi. You do not want to, or are not able to understand the content of my message. The FIRST sentence in the lead section states WHO is the person and, if needed, what he/she is NOTABLE for.

So, to take in account what you 'kindly' suggest and the word chosen by another user, I actually put it in a sentence that follows the first one (i.e. the second sentence of the page, although I really think it duplicates the last paragraph of the lead section and really think somebody else will mind  as much as I do and remove the sentence, and the word for that matter) .

Just wanted to let you know that the citation needed marking needs to be inserted in articles using the template  (a convenient shortcut that produces the same result is ). Like other wikicode and templates this will be expanded, when you save the page, to the superscripted “citation needed” text as well as—and this is the crucial bit—adding the article to a hidden maintenance category. When you simply insert the text “citation needed” and format it the article won't be added to that category and it'll be harder for other editors to find it.

Anyways, just wanted to let you know about the templates and say thanks for the cleanup on `Faustus.",0

for one thing, it focuses exclusively on solid material - what about fluids and solids? For another, the most important concepts are buried under mountains of crap - the most simple, basic and important concepts, like ductile materials failing under shear and brittle failing under normal, fluids supporting normal but flowing under shear ... that should be in the intro. Instead, the article drones on and on with graduate level tensor math that should be spit into other articles.",1

"PROOF OF THE 4-DIMENSIONAL SMOOTH POINCARE' CONJECTURE IN PDE's ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY 

The 4-dimensional smooth Poincaré conjecture has been proved in the following work:

DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-1124-0. arXiv: 1101.0283[math.AT].

For complementary information see also the following works:

The method used is the Algebraic Topology of PDE's formulated by A. Prástaro in a series of early published works on the geometric theory of PDE's and the characterization of their global solutions by means of suitable bordism groups.

In particular in [1] and [2] it is proved the following theorem.

Theorem [Integral h-cobordism in Ricci flow PDE's]
The Ricci flow equation for n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, admits that starting from a n-dimensional sphere S^n, we can dynamically arrive, into a finite time, to any n-dimensional homotopy sphere $M$. When this is realized with a smooth solution, i.e., solution with characteristic flow without singular points, then S^n is diffeomorphic to M. The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.
In particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n. In particular, the case n=4, is related to the proof that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is true.",0

Took me a while to figure out what you were talking about; that edit was almost a month ago.  The explanation on the page suggested that making the edit would block the script running the bot from its source, which was the intention.  Blocking the IP it was using as a logged-out bot, which is what was originally done, was causing collateral damage.  All bots are supposed to know that they're logged out and stop themselves (or be able to log themselves back in); the absence of that section of code is a serious matter, because bot editing is restricted to named bot accounts, and is essentially a malfunction.  Just think if someone had blocked the range (which someone was considering doing!), not realizing that it was the WMF Labs - none of the Labs-based tools regularly used on this project would have functioned, and cross-wiki bot activity would also have been adversely affected.  Better than 90% of bots include code that tells the bot how to check if it is logged in, and what to do if it is not, and many that don't require hands-on control. There's no reason for these ones not to include that code. Heck, they can probably swipe it from one of the other open-source coded bots currently in operation.  
I'm also confused by your statement,  was the bot blocked or not? and was it editing logged-in or logged-out? If it was editing logged out, then there's an even more serious problem because it should always need a manual restart after a block.  If it was editing logged-in, then the """"kill switch"""" isn't working.  So, no matter how you look at it, something's not working right.   """,0

""":The wording that was reverted was as follows:


Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[2]...

2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a """"country"""" (example). The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a """"province"""" (UK: example; NI: example) or a """"region"""" (UK: example; NI: example). Regardless of the choice of term, it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective:
 """"One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government."""" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford
 """"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change."""" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter
 """"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'."""" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, its population was 1,685,000, constituting between a quarter and a third of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the United Kingdom.

 Thomas Jefferson - Paleontologist 

I propose adding Paleontologist to the Categories. From the Wikipedia article, Vertebrate paleontology:

Thomas Jefferson is credited with initiating the science of vertebrate paleontology in the United States with the reading of a paper to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1797. Jefferson presented fossil bones of a ground sloth found in a cave in western Virginia and named the genus (Megalonyx). The species was ultimately named Megalonyx jeffersonii in his honor.Jefferson, Thomas, """"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia"""", Read before the American Philosophical Society, March 10, 1797. The """"certain bones"""" consisted of three large claws and associated smaller bones. He theorized that they were the remains of an extinct lion which he named Megalonyx (""""giant claw""""). In 1799, Dr. Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as belonging to a giant ground sloth. In 1822 Wistar officially named it Megalonyx jeffersonii.Jefferson, Thomas (1799), """"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia"""", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 4 pp. 246-260.Wistar, Caspar (1799), """"A Description of the Bones Deposited, by the President, in the Museum of the Society, and Represented in the Annexed Plates"""", Transactions, pp. 526-531, plates. Jefferson corresponded with Cuvier, including sending him a shipment of highly desirable bones of the American mastodon and the woolly mammoth.Rice, Howard C, Jr., """"Jefferson's Gift of Fossils to the Museum of Natural History in Paris,"""" Proceeding of the American Philosophical Society, 95 (1958): 597-627.

He also carried on a well known lively debate and correspondence with Buffon, and engaged others, including Lewis and Clark, to procure specimens for study. He is just as much the Father of American Paleontology as he is the Father of American Architecture, neither for which is he primarily known, nor from which he deign make a livelihood. If cryptographer made the cut, I'm just sayin...

Iranian Villagers
Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet. The authors speculated this could be because their diets, which were very low in protein, allowed for B12-producing bacteria to ascend into the ileum where the B12 could be absorbed. They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

I have never heard even the bad press call him a """"white Supremacist""""-extreme rightwing, hatemonger, anti-semite and other bogeymen namesyes.  These would again be stupid name calling without any legitmate application in their use.  

So how is """"White Supremacist"""" NPOV and """"Canadian patriot"""" NOT?!  I think it's a matter of false perspective.  BTWthere is a link to David Lethbrigde, who was nothing but a Jewish-Marxist """"Professor"""", who misled a gang of youths in disrupting meetings of lawfully abiding citizens using their right to free speechmooning an assembly of mature people is being a """"professor"""" worthy of even the slightest consideration here!!!

The link to anti-semitic, which I find to be an absurd page in the first place is just another smear tactic (used by left-to-right so-called) to quell the right to question and discuss anything that has to do with things """"Jewish"""", Zionist, Israeli by labelling people as if they were the devil themselves. I personally know of many Jews who stood by his stance on freedom of speech and any published articles on the exploits of Zionism and it's New World Order machinations.

"""::Regarding Silver's """"timber leg,"""" Silver specifically says that he learned his craft as a sailor while in the navy. In fact, he specifically mentions that he was a """"master mariner,"""" which indicates he was an officer on a warship (yes, the pirate could have been lying regarding his former rank) and that he lost his leg in battle, which would doubtlessly lead to his retirement from active naval service. However, with the skills of a former naval officer (incidentally, who would have been trained in navigation) he would have had an easy time joining up with a pirate crew. (He was likely lying about serving under Captain England given the dates.) Also, Silver was Flint's quartermaster, which in the Royal Navy is the helmsman's position. Given that his one-legged status does not seem to make him any less lethal a pirate  he takes down a man by nailing him in the spine with his crutch!  there is no reason to suppose that he retired from the life of a gentleman of fortune because he had one leg. He retired because Flint died.

Hello,

You recently deleted File:Nasrallah.jpg, citing this discussion.  I'd just like to know how one person saying the image should be deleted constitutes consensus on the topic, because I really don't think it should.

Additionally, deletion discusions are not votes and are instead determined based on the strength of the various arguments presented; in this case, I feel that the delete !votes were more grounded in policy than your own (no offense intended), as previous consensus in many discussions has shown that just because a free image of a person can't be found doesn't mean that one couldn't be made or that a copyright holder of a non-free image won't release it under a free license; therefore, it is replaceable, as Peripitus describes. – (T • C • L)",0

 Hi Marcuse. I see you've run into Sojambi Pinola. don't mind him, he's a buffoon. He is friend of Biff Rose's. They mention each other on their respective web spots. Looks like the two of them are on here basahing other people until they stand alone as edit king. Too bad someone else wrote about Rose's own anti semiticism, and racism. Poor Sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since. The sad thing is, he is so one sided, he has a difficult time persuading others of his NPOV- therefore he lashes out, and you were caught up in the crossfire(evidence here[]) Notice, he's only comparing what he wants you to see. the connection? well there isn't any really, but by creative use of wiki skills he tries to cover his own manipulations by using hanging you up as the villain. It's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. By accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. It's also reminiscent of those toubling Republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. He's a schmuck. Claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. Next he'll claim to be a woman. He's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the Rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place.

DOUBLE STANDARDS & NOT BEING NEUTRAL

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia and """"WHOVILLE"""" since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such.

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?  

""""Whoville"""" and “Blackpearl14"""" do you, your friends and family or any contributors, editors, administrators or Mr. Wales or their friends and family own stock within the Walt Disney Company?

Many of the other statements on the Walt Disney Company page don’t follow your so-called neutral definition.  Following your own claim of “neutral”, the entire page would have to be deleted per your own standards.  Furthermore, the lawsuit sentence that was placed on it, was exactly as the other statements of “criticism” within the Walt Disney Company page, yet you claim",0

 Hi Nabeelsahab, thanks for the note. There are a number of problems with your edit on Zad al-Ma'ad. Firstly, the content you added seems to have been copied and pasted from http://www.kalamullah.com/zaad-al-maad.html. The text is therefore copyrighted material and should be removed. Please see Wikipedia:Copy-paste.

Secondly, Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view based on reliable secondary sources. Websites such as kalamullah.com are not considered reliable due to there polemic and sectarian nature. Neutral sources include media agencies such as the BBC or academic sources. Please read WP:RS. There are a number of academic sources on Ibn Qayyim such as the works of Livnat Holtzman and Jon Hoover which you should consider looking into that might provide reliable and accurate information about Zad al-Ma'ad.

Thirdly, the language of the article needs to be Encyclopedic. Claims such as """"This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah.."""" seems to be an example of puffery. Please read  WP:PUFF.

Fourthly, adding statements such as """"Available from Australian Islamic Library website"""" seems to be a clear case of WP:PROMOTION. Zad al-Ma'ad is available in a whole series of websites such as http://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Complete_Zaad_al_Maad.pdf, http://idci.co.uk/Provisions-For-The-Hereafter-Mukhtasar-Zad-Al-maad-699-d etc.... so there is no need to specify the Australian Islamic Library in particular.

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

 No she is not. She is of Italian descent and was raised Roman Catholic, and she also attended a Catholic school. She is not Jewish. She is Catholic, and the article already has sources stating so. [[User:Willth",0

I thought we all discussed this that there would be no more merging..I'm going to say no for each one because I believe the format we have right now is absolutely perfect. And Grantz is hardly a stub, more of his back story I can see is coming soon, and his freakish zanpakuto may have more abilities then before. Kaien should be left alone because he a key character for Rukia's history. And Mayuri and Ukkitake have a lot of screen time (even though Mayuri's backstory hasn't been revealed, but Ukkitake's has) and Grimmjow is now Ichigos nemesis, now almost half-dead. I'm not even going to mention Kira or Matsumoto. I've said what I wanted to say, and now about Nell's status. How long have we seen her? 50-60+chapters? After we know the Zanpakuto, we should give her an article THIS week. Oh, why the bloody hell would you vote 'yes' Aizen to be merged? He's the major antagonist for christ's sakes!

"""************************ HENRIETTA VAN LAER says, No,. it's not that having an agenda at all is a problem for Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda [pro-socialists, liberals, greens and gays, determined to vilify and demonize conservatives]. It is a completely biassed source. Its articles on so-called left-wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so-called right-wing parties are nothing but vilification, most of it based on flimsy third-hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. Instead of detailing their policies, Wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. The frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing, particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.
POV in Wiki-speak = different POV to us, the Wiki-police.
 I also get the impression that Wikipeople are pretty young. There is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.
Under """"conservative"""" we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. How naive can you get? I don't know what the term """"fat cat"""" means in the USA but here in Britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of 10-15 times the average. Naturally they are inclined to vote Labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. Then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right-wing tax-cutting party. Many of them earn two or three times the average wage, and like the fat  cats, they get generous pension-packages too. Added to the votes of the millions of people who live long-term on state benefits, this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest-Joe workers or low-paid.

It makes just as much sense to use the  ADL as a source in the Stormfront article as it does to use Stormfront as a source in the Holocaust article.

I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".

Please see what has transpired on Zakir Naik. Agnistus has continued to reinsert the poorly sourced contentious material.. After being warned about violating 3RR, a new account is created and reverts for him. This is likely linked to the comment he left on my talk page. I think this is becoming unduly disruptive now.

Steve, are you preparing for your FAC run?  I haven't been keeping up with your edits there, because I hurt my back badly and am ... drugged ... so please give me a heads up before you go to FAC, so I can read it.  Best,  (Talk) 

Hi. I don't think the article is too far off FAC now; I've added about 20,000 bytes since the peer review closed. In hindsight, I should have left the PR until after I got the Stoneman book, but I didn't think I'd get much from it (Stoneman has a COI in that he was the head of the Irish Film Board at the time and essentially greenlit the film). Used carefully, however, it's been a real goldmine of production information. I'm still working my way through it, but I don't think there'll be too much else to add other than fine detail; he does tackle the 18 specific points of contention from the petition, but I'll probably err on the side of caution and leave that for the existing sources, which have a little more distance from the subject. Of course, I won't take it to FAC without consulting on its talk page first. Sorry to hear about your back; I really hope it clears up soon (and that the drugs are at least offering some measure of fun; if they're not ... get better drugs!). Best,  T • C 
 no fun, no relief ... better drugs tomorrow if something doesn't improve!   (Talk) 

  The Barnstar of Integrity To Steve, an awesome editor, for bringing a piece of propoganda ... errrr ... """"documentary"""" to featured status, with aplomb, scholarship, diplomacy and neutrality!    (Talk) 

So, at last! It finally staggered across the line like a drunk uncle in an unfinished simile. On the plus side, I've now got the experience of seeing an otherwise excellent article receiving little input because it's on a niche subject. I couldn't have done it without your help; and the same goes for the other editors, who charitably stood aside when I arrogantly started throwing my weight around and rewriting the thing. Hopefully now I can relax by tackling something a little less in-depth or controversial. -) Cheers again,  T • C 
 In my role as FAC delegate, I'm pretty steamed about how you were ignored.  In my role as a Venezuela editor, I'm even more steamed that your neutrality was questioned, since the article is more neutral than I like )  Best,  (Talk) 
I guessed that'd be the case; I know you'd have liked the article to be a little lot more scathing, but had I taken that route I don't think it would have come as far as it has. Instead, the only option was to give enough information about both views of the film to allow intelligent readers to make up their own minds. I think it pretty much does that. As an aside, I'm currently in e-mail correspondence with Stoneman, who says he'll dig into his boxes of material to see if there's anything I can use to clear up Jayen466's last unresolved comment about the conclusion to the BBC investigation. Hopefully, I can get that in before the inevitable main page nomination next April. -) Best,  T • C

"Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy

Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement.  Any choice of target
redistributes from some groups to others - making some worse off.
For example, high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt - including
pensioneers, holders of fixed income securities, employees with protected
jobs and annuity-like compensation (including most government employees,
and policy makers, and most tenured academics), and creditors.  It benefits
net debtors - particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest
rate caps.  It also benefits owners of commodities, real estate, foreign currencies,
equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and
offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed.  Low inflation benefits
holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country,
importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions
and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees,
and policy makers).  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers -
increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets,
and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate,
owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed.

In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement),
however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political 
resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical.

To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer
of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool 
and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies.

Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy
targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, 
debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants
in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities  
and real estate, and the precariously employed

If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency
impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within
and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move
an economy away from an efficient frontier.

Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents 

From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face 
a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the
form of a secure fixed annuity.  This would incentivize them to favor
tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth.
Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related
to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly
loose monetary policy.  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth 
contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their
overall moral hazard.",0

Wikipedia requires that user-created images be under a free license: one that permits unrestricted reproduction and modification.  However, there is a way around this.

If you want to restrict who can use your images, your best bet is to license them under the GFDL, with an offer to let people use them under other license terms if they ask.

The GFDL is a very awkward license for images.  It was designed around the needs of the emacs user manual, and requires that the full text of the license be included anywhere that material under the license is published, and that any work containing GFDL material be licensed under the GFDL.  This isn't a problem for things as large as websites and books, but it's not practical for smaller things such as posters and magazine articles, and for-profit companies usually don't want to publish their work under anything but simple copyright.

So, by licensing under the GFDL, you let the images be used on Wikipedia and related projects (such as Wikibooks or Wikipedia Commons), on Wikipedia re-users such as Answers.com, and on other GFDL-licensed websites.  At the same time, you make it difficult to use the image in printed works and in commercial projects, giving you some control over who re-uses your images.

 Legislation: European Union 

 The atricle claims: """"The European Union has ratified a law """"banning incitement to or denial of genocide"""" (both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide)."""" The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide).""""

 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred
Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?   """,0

Edits for Your Consideration

Well I see the hounds are already out rapidly editing, which is fine.  Two requests for your consideration please:
1) """"Texas Government Newsletter"""" needs a reference.  It had one but it was removed so it is now un-referenced.  The reference I have below is from the Library of Congress US Copyright Office showing the official copyright by me of the publication.  Seems like a really SOLID ref to me.

2)  NN has removed my client list as expected.  The fact that I have such top-notch clients (Dell, Tokyo Electron, AT&T;, Southland Corp, etc) seems to me to help establish at least some level of notability and shows the level where my business operates. All of the listed clients (100%) have Wikipedia pages and are therefore all also internal links.   To be fair, he, on the other hand, asserts that the article is about the man, not the business, and the external link to my website should cover it.

"Mouse versus fruitfly
There is some interesting stuff about the comparison between doing this prize with a mouse and doing it with fruitflies (drosophila). A couple of the more interesting points are that in a lab you can cheaply maintain and process larger numbers of fruitflies than mice, and the fruitfly lifespan is much shorter than the mouse lifespan so you get quicker feedback.

But I also understand the publicity argument that people feel more kinship with mice. It's easier as a non-scientist to believe that results in mice are much more relevant to humans. Results in mice will more easily attract funding for subsequent work.

Does it make sense for researchers to work with fruitflies first, and then port their techniques to mice for later 
confirmation and to collect the prize? Hopefully that would take relatively little more time and expense than doing the whole thing with fruitflies. We'd eventually need to port these techniques from mice to humans anyway, so there is a presumption that porting across species is feasible.",0

Listing what was given to me was all I could do. Also, adding an {{incomplete}} tag wouldn't do any good since aside from the cleanup (which I can do myself), no more information from the 4 missing mysteries or the ones not explained with ever appear in the series.

Your opinions on red light cameras are off base as your candidate has yet to come up with a better solution to raise funds to get us out of fiscal emergency.

Mr Wagner goes around telling people whatever they want to hear in order to get their votes. Including but not limited to offering political patronage jobs to anyone willing to support him. Mr Wagner has been long known for playing dirty tricks as well as insulting his peers and the Mayor himself. The recent theft of the name of the Democratic Party orchestrated by his stooges such as yourself and """"Mr Lamoron"""" can only serve to harm his popularity and candidacy.

The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as """"Black"""", it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - """"black"""" only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves """"Brown"""" (""""Moreno"""") on the census (presumably this is what you are calling """"mestizo""""). If we simply used the """"Black"""" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the """"Brown"""" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the """"black""""/""""brown"""" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. 
The 100% issue is a red herring - """"mestizo"""" and """"African ancestry"""" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... """"mestizo"""" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in """"mestizo"""" are also included in """"African ancestry"""" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect """"Afican ancestry"""" to be all of the """"Black"""" category plus part of the """"Brown"""" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.

"I think all Wikipedia Nobel Prize lists must be augmented by this crucial  information.

The lists of laureates by university or by country must take this into account as well. For example, Glauber (US), Hall (US) and Hänsch (Germany) shared the physics prize of 2005. But we cannot simply add 2.00 points to the US count and 1.0 to the German count. Instead we have to add 0.75 to the US count and 0.25 to the German count (Hänsch and Hall each got only 0.25 of the prize, Glauber got 0.5). Otherwise we'd violate the Nobel Prize conservation law:  The sum of the Nobel Prizes per year is constant; you may divide it among many laureates, but then the laureates necessarily become less outstanding on average.",0

I am slowly working on many of the mountains of Washington.  I do one or two a day.
I have identified a list of notable mountains that pages will be created.  One is a list of highest points in each of Washington's 39 counties.  I research if they need disambiguation.  So for Big Horn mountain I had to research whether there were other things called Big Horn - there are tons of them.  As you can see there are hundreds of uses of Big Horn.  If I can, I find newspaper articles relating to the place.   But due to the literally thousands of misspellings of bighorn sheep, businesses and other things like transformer toys and a ship...

 Penmon, Anglesey 

Hi there.  You may have noticed that I've been adding to the excellent article you created here - a few extra refs and some photographs, plus an infobox as suggested by a reviewer.  (Oh, and I renamed it too!) Can you think of anything else that can be added at the moment?  I would be interested in nominating it for an assessment for Good Article status - I haven't done this before, but it seems to comply with the criteria (or to be nearly there, anyway).  What do you think?   

You baked the cake, I just added the icing!  Fingers crossed...

Hi Werdna,someone correctly noted at WP:Requests for comment/May 2010 skin change/Bug reports#Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen that the preferences option """"Widen the edit box to fill the entire screen"""" doesn't actually do that. I notice that you changed the wording of that option one year ago, in rev:49553. Two questions:
 Was that requested or discussed anywhere, or more an ad-hoc wording and we can just tweak it to something like """"Widen the edit box to fill the available space""""?
 Why is that option in there in the first place? Seems to me that width:100% would be a good default for all installations, and site admins can just tweak it in their installations' CSS if they want.

Meetup

You may well have seen a site notice about the next Cambridge meetup, this Saturday 29 May. I thought those who have been in the past should have a personal invite, too.   

 What the hell? 

What the hell is """"It is my polite recommendation that you continue to contribute in areas in which you can make constructive contributions (like RfA) instead of making provocative comments in lieu of contributing to others"""" supposed to mean? I have virtually no involvement with RFA, and AFAIK am the single highest contributor of FAs to WP:LONDON; have you confused me with someone else?

As per my initial comments when the BM scheme was announced, I have serious reservations about creating formal ties between Wikipedia—whose prime selling point is editorial independence and a neutral point of view—and with any one museum, university or other institution. Quite aside from the glaring COI issue of an organisation paying people to promote their exhibits, nobody has even touched on the tax issues of paid editing being channelled (directly or indirectly) through the WMF. As you may know, I'm generally supportive of the idea of paid editing—I don't see how someone paid to promote an organisation differs from a fan of a band writing about said band, provided the COI is declared and the writer adheres to NPOV—but the talkpage of an almost moribund WikiProject is certainly not the place to unilaterally overturn what was a pretty overwhelming consensus at WP:Requests for comment/Paid editing. – scent 

 So you had serious and substantial reservations, and you decided to express them by making provocative comparisons? It's like the Wikipedia version of Godwin's Law.
 I've already made my own arguments about the importance of intent and outcome in """"paid editing"""", on the discussion page itself.  Saying that the British Museum is """"paying people to promote their exhibits"""", is at odds with the facts of this situation (as Liam has explained). I have no comment on """"tax issues"""", and consider that outside of the community's remit in any case — it can be dealt with by the Foundation, if indeed money is being """"channeled through"""" the latter. Your comments on circumventing community consensus have no relevance to me; if you'd like to make a big drama-fest out of somebody offering incentives to write featured-quality articles about notable historical artifacts, then I invite you to do so and see what response you get. —  • talk 

No, I had serious and substantial reservations, as did David Cane, and we listed them in great detail at the time the proposal was announced; to his extreme credit and unlike you, Liam paid the courtesy of answering them in detail rather than posting a rambling personal attack.

"It slows trains down because the existing speed limits already have a significant margin of safety built in so the engineer can exceed them by small amounts and still remain safe.  With PTC such fluctuations over the posted limit will trigger an overspeed alarm with the result that crews will check their speed several mph below what is authorized.  PTC does not increase capacity except possibly on low density lines that were previously not signaled.  ACSES does not actually handle any sort of anti-colision duties.  Those are covered by the legacy fixed block cab and wayside signaling system.  On non-ACSES routes the PTC unit is attached to the wires leading to the wayside signal.  If reliable enough this can provide the same functionality as cab signals, but at a far higher price point. Just because wireless data is involves does not mean PTC is the same as moving block or CTBC.  Finally because of the reliance of wireless links, PTC systems are prone to disruption just like your cell phone or WiFi or digital TV signal.  It is a whole raft of components, all with their own failure rates that will require contingency operations when they stop working.  If those systems were never installed those instances of degraded operations caused by PTC and only PTC would never be encountered.",0

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk).

For Andrewa

1) """"12-string"""" is vernacular, embedded in our business from the catalogues of the original manufacturers (the last people interested in logic or organology) and later """"folk"""" nomenclature (never scholarly nomenclature). [The same holds for the B.C. Rich company's catalogue referring to its coursed instrument as """"the 10-string guitar"""".]

2) Any instrument with at least one non-single string should use """"course"""" for clarity by any serious musicologist.

3) Intruments with 10 single strings should be termed """"10-stringed guitars"""" rather than """"the 10-string guitar"""" because there is no one 10-string guitar (with the definitive article).

4) I suggest you start a new article and title it '10-stringed guitars' under which you differentiate the various types under sub-headings accordign to their number of courses. The baroque guitar would fall under 5-course, the B.C. Rich instrument would fall under 6-course. 

5) I suggest a non-guitarist baroque lutenist should mediate this and offer an opinion on the established musicological use of the terms course and string. 

6) We must recognise that """"12-string guitar"""" is an exception to and deviation from a well-established musicological/organological convention, and not the rule according to which we should re-write the terminology. We should also recognise that the term 12-string guitar enters not via musicologists or scholars but via guitar manufacturers and was later taken up mainly by folk musicians. In contrast there is an extensive scholarly history of referring to instruments with at least one PAIR of strings as coursed, not (single) strung/stringed. Now, I am not suggesting re-naming """"12-string guitars"""", but it is a mistake (and folly) to try to oppose centuries-old scholarly conventions and to take the exception as the rule and re-write the terminology of organology.

The reception of this article doesn't seem to take everyone's view into account.

Kinda like /b, isn't it.) who simply detest the game for its rude community that now believes (Completely on west, and to a certain extent on other servers) that attacking new players for the simple fact that they are new, and booting downloaders without consideration or remorse. Non-moderated games are filled with leavers. And now the banlist extends to games other than DotA, where normal players may be banned for abusive reasons (Beating the host, using novel and effective non-cheating strategies, etc). DotA has overrun Battle.Net with a storm of absolute idiots. The intelligent fraction of DotA players does not nearly make up for the fact that now small, promising maps are being shoved aside by DotA (Look at Obsidian Depths. Look at Mana Clash. Look at Advent of the Zenith.) because it isn't to that community's preference.

"""About Asala + Armenian Link ==

I just read a book of Erhan Başyurt, which can be translated as """"Adopted Armenian Orphins - Secret Lives"""" (ISBN 975-6054-26-3). In that book there's a section on relations between these secret Armenians living in Turkey and PKK / Abdullah Öcalan.  Names of some active PKK terrorists of Armenian decent listed as well. 

Some points in that book are interesting, like joint plans of carving Armenia and Kurdistan out of Turkey, PKK's increasing terrorist activities in northern east Anatolia towards old Armenian territories, cooperation for Ağrı and Dersim revolts during 20's and 30's... Support of Lebanese and Syrian Armenians...

I think this aspect of PKK should be added to the article.  Does anybody else has sources on this relationship?   

It should be spelt """"orphans"""" not """"orphins."""" I wouldn't object to having such a section in this article, if the source it comes from is valid, of course.  

 Armenian- PKK connection is partly a lie. Of course Armenia gives support to PKK but it can only be by funding PKK or by giving them political support in the world arena. Nothing more. Aremian PKK theory was created by people that want to show Kurdish minority innocent. They wanted to say """"Look... Kurdish friends don't want to kill us, Armenians want to!"""".

"Let me respond again.

I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar. 

I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how. 

Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation. 

If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'. 

If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things. 

Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil. 

There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities.",0

He claims that Nasser began looking for a means of ridding himself of UNEF after King Husseien criticised him for failing to defend the West Bank, while hiding behind the skirts of UNEF.

"I am the author of Qutbi Bohra article. I had written this article just as an informative content for wikipedia and my intentions were to update the information regarding a new sect that was formed. I am a writer and have written many articles in different media. I love to write. I came to know of Wikipedia editing very recently through a friend when he showed me how wikipedia works and editors can make contributions. It was a time when i had heard of Qutbi Bohra and when i searched the internet i got evidence regarding the same in 3 newspapers mentioning it and a newsletter. This satisfied the noteablity ans verifyablity condition of the article. I gathered information regarding the sect from the community members whom i know and have recorded my discussion with them, with their permission. Further more i also got information regarding some past acts of Khuzaima Qutbuddin which were defamatory in nature but would prove the formation of the sect. But i did not use it as per the rules of wikipedia. I have written the entire article from third person point of view, as usually written for publications and have provided supportive evidence in most of the cases and due to frequent coercing by Ftutocdg i have also written a complete article,'succession issue' to explain the actual situation which Ftutocdg is trying to hide in his bid to get the Qutbi Bohra article removed. The reason that he is giving is just his point of view that he is trying to impose on the article. He has regularly done vandalism to this article and also has done the same to many Dawoodi Bohra articles along with some other editors in his group. As mentioned by Ftutocdg you can check the contribution i have made to Wikipedia, i have done all my edits with thorough study and reliable references. I would also like to suggest you to please look into the contribution of Ftutocdg and his group of editors they have just created a lot of chaos using the dark side of the very principles of Wikipedia the helps develop an article.

The current full official names of the organization are simply Ezras Torah in Hebrew and Torah Relief Society in English as can be seen at http://www.ezrastorah.org/about_us.php and in their mailings.  

(Mossad) Ezras Torah was founded in August 1915 and was known by that name in numerous Yiddish and Hebrew news articles, advertisements and publications from the early 20th century.  Ezras Torah's own publications (see the links to the hebrewbooks.org documents on the wiki page) also mention just Ezras Torah without any addendum.  One can also see """"Ezras Torah Fund"""" without any additional title listed in page 45 of the following PDF document American Jewish Yearbook, 1921-1922 (Directories).
The organization was incorporated in early 1920 under the name Torah Relief Society.  The incorporation document can be found in New York City's Division of Old Records in Manhattan.

I can think of three possibilities re: """"for Relief of European and Palestinian Rabbis""""
1) The 1936 volume by Julius Caesar Schwarz was giving a description and not adding to the title
2) That book was in error
3) Ezras Torah had a different official name in the mid-20th century (this would need to be supported by official documents or from material published by Ezras Torah)

If either of the first two possibilities were correct then the later English language publications listed above might have just copied the lengthened organization name from earlier English language sources without consulting more authoritative sources.

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!   →  talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 11000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.  →  talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.   →  talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.  →  talk """,0

Ralf Reski may meet the criteria, but if he does, there is no evidence of that in the article. If he indeed does meet the criteria, please add the evidence for this to the article. While it is true that these are just guidelines, and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion, the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made. I’m not trying to prove that he isn’t notable, I’m trying to determine if he is.
As far as I can see, the criteria are not met:
1. The person's research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline, broadly construed, as demonstrated by independent reliable sources.
I’m not a fan of citation metrics, and they’re not the final word, but the h-index is 30, which is pretty average. The most cited paper does have over 300 citations, but that’s the moss genome sequence, where he’s one of many authors. Genome sequences always get lots of citations.
2. The person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level.
This may be true, but the article does not mention it. I don’t think a Heisenberg fellowship counts as ‘highly prestigious.
3. The person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association (e.g. a National Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society) or a Fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor (e.g. the IEEE).
Again this may be true, but isn’t mentioned in the article.
4. The person's academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education, affecting a substantial number of academic institutions.
No major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article.
5. The person holds or has held a named chair appointment or """"Distinguished Professor"""" appointment at a major institution of higher education and research.
No evidence for this is given in the article.
6. The person has held a major highest-level elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society.
From what I can see in the article, the highest position he has held was dean of the Faculty of Biology.
7 The person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity.
No evidence for this given in the article.
8. The person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major well-established academic journal in their subject area.
Only normal editorial board memberships given in the article.
9. The person is in a field of literature (e.g writer or poet) or the fine arts (e.g. musician, composer, artist), and meets the standards for notability in that art, such as WP:CREATIVE or WP:MUSIC.
Does not apply.
If you can show that the criteria are met after all, I’m happy to go along with it, but just being a professor does not satisfy WP:PROF. Cheers!   """,0

 Let's Clarify Something here 

First of all, nice to meet you Stephanie Adams. I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)

I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.

Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in """"Used to.... but does not anymore""""

I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, """"Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage"""" then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.

""""::you don't understand propaganda.""""
That is a loaded statement if I ever read one. I have read up on the term propaganda, thanks very much, and my readings are not simply limited to this website, which I feel is narrow in its scope. I have been on a program that toured the death camps of Poland and studied the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany. I am currently awaiting a response from a PhD who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry, and it is with respect to our point of contention here. Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. I have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue, and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. 

""""You use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.""""
I am not denouncing advertising for products I consider harmful, and this is what you need to understand, because I have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, """"base tan""""), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). 

So please enlighten me, Mr Jensen, as to what propaganda is? Is propaganda not """"a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?"""". That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as """"presenting one side of an argument"""" to """"influence the attitude of the community""""? Or, is it that, as you say, I just """"don't understand propaganda""""? 

I have to say it yet again to you, because I think this is such an important point that I have to drive home - this is not my """"opinion"""". 1) Tanning beds cause more harm than good, fact. 2) Tanning industry sites present the good (which is partly true) and negate the bad (partly false), and this is also a fact. If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of """"good business"""" - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o",0

 there is nothing more sad then an administrator who bans people just because they have written a superior article. 

Let me clear up a few things here. First off, I am not an """"IRA supporter"""". I am a 36 year old proud former US Marine who served my country and I resent being called a """"Terrorist Supporter"""". I have never given money to the IRA, I am Irish Catholic and I support Sinn Fein, but not the IRA. I personally do not believe the IRA are terrorists in the same veign as the UDA/UVF, Hezbollah or Al Qaida. The IRA is much more like the Iraqi Kurds, Northern Alliance, Jewish Irgun, French Resistence, and American Revolutionaries. I am also not a UDA/UVF terrorist apologist as Jdorney seems to be.

I also resent being banned just because some wanna-be administrator is upset that my article contains more accuracies then his does. I have re-edited my article and placed all the proper Sources, page numbers, and Quotes. I have also added to the """"Sources"""" index. I have never ment to purposely delete anyones work, if I did so it was by accident and I apologize. I spent weeks researching this article, and alot of it is based on an article I wrote on the IRA when I was stationed at Camp. Pendleton back in 2000, the rest of it is from newer sources and books.

I certainly don't mind other people adding to the article, but I don't think that my edits should be deleted, just because they don't """"fit"""" with the bias of some editor's and administrators. I will be checking back often, and if my edits continue to be altered I will inform some senior administrators, some of whom are friends of mine.

"""

Well objectively, 200 PKK militants trained at Northern Iraq PKK military bases (which are daily informed to U.S. and Iraq governments to do some action against by Turkey) entered from Northern Iraq carrying heavy weapons; blew up a bridge attacked a military base on the other side, killed 12 but some says 16, took 8 hostages but some says 10, then bunch of soldiers were injured, and unlike in Zar'it-Shtula; PKK militants weren't trying to free anyone. They were just attacking a military base because it is their daily regular job. I mean if you don't want to call it an """"attack"""", a """"battle"""" could be called because there was a battle and 32 out of about 200 were killed. I wrote the article in Turkish Wikipedia; and I called it """"21 October 2007 Hakkari PKK battle"""" because this -what you call incident- happens regularly. Just like the 7th October 2007 Şırnak PKK battle where another dozen of Turkish soldiers were killed too. Incident occurs once, not regularly. If Slovenia regularly attacked Croatia; and let's say, their troops came from the sea with heavy weapons, blew up a military base's bridge, killed 12 Croatian soldiers and took 8 hostages; would you call it an incident ? And how about Slovenia regularly attacked -let's say- since 1984 almost all cities of Croatia. Would it look like an incident to you? Or would it look like a battle or an attack?

Don't get me wrong dear """"Korku tanrısı""""; I believe you're writing amazing articles on battles and military; and your contributions are wonderful for Wikipedia in all languages (since all of them are translated in many languages; and actually I'm one of the translators of your articles to Turkish). I believe that you are a very intelligent person; yet on this case of NPOV I don't think you're right on the """"Incident"""" issue. This """"thing"""" could be called at worst """"21 October 2007 Hakkari PKK Battle"""" (which I called in Turkish); yet it would be unjust to not call it an attack. 

Some people who have military bases in another country (which is controlled by anarchy) who happens to be your neighbor is attacking your country quite heavily equipped with weapons is called an """"attack"""". And as a military base and a country; what you have against them is a """"battle"""".

I'm removing the NPOV tag; if you don't find it vicious. And I would love to discuss with you this issue and your knowledge on Middle-East (because I completely worship your articles) privately on MSN or E-mail or even here.

It seems to me, to use a Christian metaphor, that you cast the first stone.  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.

That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.

 Group Classification

I despise getting into arguments about what a word actually means, so lets just go to the source. 

Terrorist   
♠  One that engages in acts or an act of terrorism.  American Heritage Dictionary

Terrorism  
♠  The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. 
American Heritage Dictionary

♠  The use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, esp. for political purposes.  Random House Unabridged Dictionary

Let's just call a spade a spade, and stop the mudslinging and pointless arguments. The Weather Underground was a Domestic Terror Group, self admitted. Regardless of which bombing they actually conducted, the fact is that they used violence to promote an agenda. The bomb that killed Robbins, Diana Oughton, and Ted Gold on March 6, 1970 was dynamite surrounded by roofing nails. Shrapnel is not added to bombs for structural damage, it is added to increase fatalities.
I am sorry but there is no difference between these people and those like Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

 You see... 

...I respect the rules; I think they are a necessary backbone in our society. Sure...there are times when one must chose to ignore them (for good reasons) but one should treat the rules as a backbone, a guideline of sorts.

But the rules are simply words and letters; what gives them importance is the way they are carried out. It is like, say, a football tournament: if there is blatant cheating, controversial circumstances without a doubt, and similar cases, then the competition would lose prestigue, importance, and it would matter little.

The rules are very much like that; in here, I was blocked for some BS. I will admit that I could have prevented the situation and acted better; however, it doesn't change the fact that some people here have blatant double-standards that I had to endure personally. And when the rules doesn't apply to everyone on a somewhat equal level, then the rules lose meaning, it becomes pointless, and it transforms into something I can wipe my ass with.

Where does that stem for? Giving the wrong people the wrong tools. I understand there are certain factions that are here solely to protect articles against vandalism (something I have done once or twice to test my theory out), but it seems the emphasis has changed: a great deal of the admin I interact do not try to protect articles, but seems to spend more time blocking users who are deemed """"unlikeable"""", mostly because of difference of opinion (most of the time, it is nothing more than that. I have personally read a great deal of the admin's incident reports for this year).

I've discovered my guess was correct regarding the two labels, and the distinction is now in the article with a source cited. I would still like information about album credits such as any other credited writers, credited musicians, etc. 
Since this article is (I think) nearly ready to be upgraded from draft status, you should consider the feasibility of making an album cover image available for use on Wikipedia. A promotional image from the Krai premiere performance would also make a nice illustration for the article, if the label owns copyright to any such images.

Remove – Entire article is of questionable notability. There also appears to be an agenda here, being pushed, often through tag-team and uncivil retorts, on this talk page. Wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of """"not censored"""" rhetoric, each day. I'm waiting for a photo of a """"sheep shagger"""" to appear on Welsh or Scottish article, under the guise of """"notability"""". Some editors here have serious pro-gay COI/POV issues and need to step back, especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of """"homophobia"""" out of turn. Why is the solo female fister a cartoon, and the male fister a photo, for a start? Not very neutral. Why does there even need to be a photo, when all the article needs is a description – I mean, it's hardly rocket science, and that guy hardly has a """"rocket"""" worth shouting about? You don't need a photo on how to boil eggs, so why one here? Again, it's anti-Wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids, more agenda/politically motivated, more pornographic, less educational, detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see Wiki develop. Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use """"not censored"""" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. Age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. Photos such as this are what lead to the Foundation considering an """"image filter"""" recently. I'm pro-LGB (-T) but I also believe in """"behind closed doors"""". And I disagree with anyone who says kids won't look it up. When I was young kids looked """"dirty words"""" up in the dictionary. Now the internet is here, and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. Let's put it this way: because of """"no legal threats"""", no LGBT members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this. COPPA stands a better chance, as child protection is of far greater importance than censorship, where there is limited parental control. WikiKamaSutra anyone?  [Chat • RFF] """,0

"Does really need a Rewrite
I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism: 

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history. This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology, but misleading about other topics as well. There is a debate to be had about Marxism and teleology, but this has not been written here.",0

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works. I rather suspect that we could use more decent contributors for Fiji-related subjects, for example. -   """,0

Also, this is the current religion section that I'd like to check with other users to reach consensus. What do you guys think?:

A 2012 national telephone survey in English of a sample of 400 Iranian-Americans, commissioned by the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans and conducted by Zogby Research Services, asked the respondents what their religions were.  The responses broke down as follows: Muslim: 31%, """"No response"""": 15%,  atheist/realist/humanist: 11%, agnostic: 8%, Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and """"Other"""": 15%. The survey had a cooperation rate of 31.2%. The margin of error for the results was +/- 5 percentage points, with higher margins of error in sub-groups.

Due to the laws regarding apostasy in Islam, some Iranians do not claim Islam as their religion, but would in fear of persecution. The Central Committee for Ex-Muslims was founded by Iranian Ehsan Jami with an aim to support apostates and to bring forth the reality of women's rights violations in the religion. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through war and invasion, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the novel, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious.

There are religious and ethnolinguistic differences among the Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Christian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Assyrian groups.Nilou Mostofi, Who We Are: The Perplexity of Iranian-American Identity, The Sociological Quarterly (published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the Midwest Sociological Society), Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 681–703, p. 685 Calculating the percentage of Christian Iranian-Americans is difficult because most Iranian Christians are of Armenian or Assyrian origin and self-identify as such, rather than as Iranian.""",0

 Words and their meaning 

Like your confusion over the meaning of """"homophobia"""", Bugs, you've shown by your comments about """"homicide"""" on WP:ANI that you don't seem to understand how the English language actually works.

The most obvious thing is to point out that prefixes and suffixes (like """"homo/homi"""" and """"cide"""") are NOT governed by fixed rules maintained by some authority. Secondly, even given generally observed rules as to the meanings of certain prefixes and suffixes, actual usage  whether intentional on the part of the coiner, definitional drift, or simply by being idioms  determines actual meanings. Finally, for actual legal terms, those ARE given specific definitions which may or may not match """"logical"""" combinations, your impressions, or even popular usage. For the last one, I'll point you to the Cornell University School of Law:

Homicide is when one human being causes the death of another. Not all homicide is murder, as some killings are manslaughter, and some are lawful, such as when justified by an affirmative defense, like insanity or self-defense. 

This is Wikipedia, Bugs: words mean what reliable sources say they mean, not what you'd like them or how you've work them out in your mind to mean. If you're going to proclaim you understand the meaning of word, you need to check first.  | Talk 
Your opinion has been noted and logged. ← What's up, Doc? carrots→ 
Without affirmation that Bugs doesn't seem to know how the English language works (that's a bit strong, imo), he is right for 99% of the time that the word homicide is used. My input here, to be helpful, is that I have seen the death certificates of state-executed convicts which are correctly labeled """"homicide"""" as the cause of death. It is rare but does affirm that homicide does not always mean murder. —  (talk) 
Right. And I didn't say """"always"""", I said """"typically"""". ← What's up, Doc? carrots→ 

George Weinberg (psychologist) invented the term """"homophobia"""", and it's clear enough that he used """"phobia"""" in the normal way: """"irrational fear"""". ← What's up, Doc? carrots→ """,0

Black Keys leave Fat Possum, pay tribute to Junior Kimbrough

 The Black Keys Split With Fat Possum, Prep Releases

Kati Llewellyn and Amy Phillips report:
The Black Keys and Fat Possum Records seemed like a match made in blues-rock heaven, right? But as Jack and Meg (or Puffy and J.Lo or Britney and Justin) will tell you, sometimes couples that look like they're perfect for each other just aren't meant to be. Sigh...

Black Key Dan Auerbach told Billboard.com recently that his band and Fat Possum have parted ways, and they are currently shopping around for an American home for their forthcoming album, which they hope to
release on September 12. (V2 will put the record out in Europe, and Modular will handle it in Australia.) Although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include """"Your Touch"""", """"The
Flame"""", and """"It's Just Got to Be"""". 

Auerbach assured Billboard.com that the Fat Possum split was """"amicable."""" Yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. First of all, Auerbach and his
bandmate, Patrick Carney, will leave the Mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the Chulahoma: The Songs of Junior Kimbrough EP. A six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with an
answering machine message from Kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores May 2. It includes """"The Black Keys - My Mind Is Ramblin'"""", which
the Keys covered on last year's Fat Possum Kimbrough tribute album, Sunday Nights.

Tracklist:

01 Keep Your Hands Off Her
02 Have Mercy on Me
03 Work Me
04 Meet Me in the City
05 Nobody But You
06 My Mind Is Ramblin'

Also, Fat Possum will continue to distribute Carney's Audio Eagle label, which has so far put out the Gil Mantera's Party Dream album
Bloodsongs. Future releases include stuff by two Carney side projects, 10% Animals and Marble Arches. The latter also features guitarist Jamie Stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs Audio Eagle.

That's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?

Buddy Guy. In May, they'll head to England to rock The Shins-curated date of All Tomorrow's Parties.""",0

Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.

Her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   

It's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise Wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. I’m really fed up with Wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

Is it worth mentioning that the scene in which peter stops the tasers is a clear reference to the scene in the matrix where Neo stops Agent Smith's bullets?  16:55, 21 March",0
"""I just think it's interesting how many revisions this has gone through ... here's the original 1911 """"Gutenberg"""" encyclopedia article that I pasted here originally, that has had the so-called """"Islamic bias"""" removed. I do know it needed editing, revising, expanding, and to be """"brought up to the times."""" Just something interesting to think about.

ALLAH, the Arabic name used by Moslems of all nationalities for the one true God. It is compounded of al, the definite article, and ilah, meaning a god.  The same word is found in Hebrew and Aramaic as well as in ancient Arabic (Sabaean).  The meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful; cf.  Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 82, and the Oxford Hebrew and English Lexicon, pp. 61 ff.

 2002 

A previous version of the """"Allah"""" article included the following:
""""Allah"""" was also the proper name for the pre-Islamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic Arabic tribes. The name and has no femminine or plural forms. Allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods, such as the goddesses al-Lat? and Man'at?

Anybody know why was this removed?

It seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. It appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man (Robert Mory) in the last 10 years.

Well, insofar as 'Allah' doubles as the name 'God' in Arabic we're up against the problem solved in English by capitalization, capital G for the monotheistic god of the Jews and Christians (who prefers that we NOT use his first name) versus the gods with a small G. """"Allah"""" was undoubtedly used about all SORTS of deities, and that's where the Moon-deity argument falls down.  And watch out about publishing the female-trinity bit  isn't that what got Salman Rushdie in trouble? Michael Tinkler.

I authored the paragraph about the moon-god theory. I read about this in """"Islam""""  by Jamal J. Elias, a Muslim author. The book is an intorduction to Islam from the POV of a liberal Muslim scholar. As Elias is Associate Professor of Religion at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and he writes on this theory as if it were fact, it seems there is more to this picture than the """"poor"""" work of one scholar. Therefore, I have restored the paragrah, with a note on it's contoversy.

I also authored the bit about Yahweh that was taken out. Critism accepeted, it belongs in its own article. So i have put it in Yahweh.  -  

It does seem true that Allah was the name of a moon god - and that Mohammed's father had allah as part of his name. But the name does have a feminine form - al Lat. It is not clear the connection of the moon god to the Muslim god.

Ok, first of all: Allah does simply mean """"the god"""", rather equivalent to our capitalized """"God"""". Hence, any major god (like this moon god, apparently) would have very likely been called """"God"""". I did some [admittely Internet-based] research on this topic just now, and clarified a few things in the actual text. Let me know how it reads now.

Here's a question. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, so its articles should be about topics, not words per se. So is the """"Allah"""" article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the Islamic concept of God? My initial thought would be yes.

But Arabic-speaking Christians would use the word to refer to the Christian God. Does that complicate the issue? Maybe. But one might argue that the wikipedia is in English (this one at least), and in English the word """"Allah"""" is generally used to refer to God specifically with reference to Islam. Right? So the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be under """"Allah"""". Does this make sense? Anyone disagree?

Another question - Do Muslims take Allah to be the personal name for God or just the Arabic language word meaning God. This could be tricky since by way of comparison some Christians take Yahweh to be the personal name of God while others see it as just another description """"I am what I am"""" (If there is only one of a class, i.e. one God, why would he need a personal name?)

Well. In the listing I have that is based on Hadith (the teaching tradition of Islam), Allah is listed as the first name among the 99 names.  The names read more like titles """"the Compassionate, the Merciful, etc."""", but the tradition is that they are names.  I'll add the list as an entry. MichaelTinkler

Actually we already have a page under [[:ninety-nine names of Allah|ninety-nine names of Allah.

Why can't China be considered a state which follows neoliberal policies or for that matter India.  In the case of India its policies are purely neoliberal (privatizations of state assets, deregulation, reduction of tariffs, more foreign ownership) and they have worked.  China's policies are also extremely neoliberal (allowing full repatriation of profits of foreign companies, allowing foreign ownership, privitization of state assets including hospitals schools and telecom companies, reduction of tariffs, stable currency policy, allowing foreign companies to operate with no restrictions whatsoever, allowing foreign investment with few limitations, encouraging private ownership).  The truth is all of China's reforms are strictly neoliberal since they have made it into more of a capitalist country.

"""

I agree there is a certain repetition between that and the GAA section. But it's a bit different spin at issue. At least as the anon editor presents it, the Barsamian interview is used in relation to Churchill's own ethnicity. The GAA section is about scholarly disagreements on the meaning of the Act. Moreover, while we have a quote in the GAA where Churchill affirms his belief, this quote is more specific in describing Churchill's interpretation. Maybe we should add a note like """"see also below section"""" to make the connection. Btw. your lead to the discussion of Churchill's attitude about his ethnicity is much better than the anon wrote, thanks for that. The anon's edit was a bit pedantic in tone, I thought, though the quote it introduced is worth keeping.  """,0

off-hand comment by Ludwigs2
The problem here, brangifer, and the thing that (as an academic) annoys me the most, is that you are doing something that no scholar would ever do.  You are starting from a pre-defined judgement (i.e., that anything not-science is bad) and working your way backwards to find supporting evidence for that position.  One can always find someone reputable, somewhere, who says what one already believes - ufologists do that all the time, cherry-picking quotes from scientists and government agencies -  but it's bad scholarship to do so.  You want so desperately to believe that the scientific community agrees with your radically skeptical position that you're grasping at straws.  That's not the way things are done.  Ludwigs2 """,0

 Note to Administrator Regarding Above Move Request 

To the administrator who will review the above move request.  Note that the names used in these articles were chosen after many months of discussions, discussions that included a wide variety of editors.  The compromise solution was to use Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, the Province of Trento, and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen.  This was a compromise that kept both the Italian and German usage in the names, and was also the usage in Encyclopedia Britannica (to name just one major English source).  There is slander going on above by Mai-Sachme when he says that individuals engineered this solution, or did it by some form of trickery.  He also went as far as to erase a similar warning to the reviewing administrator.  It is a little shocking, but maybe not surprising, that after a few years a certain editor tries to put things back to how he originally had placed them unilaterally.  Right here what we are seeing is nothing less than than a ambush of this page and I strongly suspect that he has contacted a lot of these editors thru e-mail to ask them to come and support this ambush.   It is no coincidence that within a couple of days all the German-speaking users who happened to be against the compromise solution show up to vote for this.  This is utter abuse of Wikipedia.  So, again, if Wikipedia is at all fair, this move request should be struck down.  It is FACT that in English both the names Alto Adige and South Tyrol, AND Province of Bolzano are in regular use.  Go to any grocery in the United States, and products from this region are advertised as """"wine from Alto Adige"""" or """"speck from Alto Adige"""".  Yet, the same editor who makes this move request (and others who are voting here) has constitently attempted to marginalize the name Alto Adige on this page, or remove its bold typeface next to South Tyrol, or even acknowledge that it is used commonly in English (just review the edits made on these pages over the past year).  What it truly shameful is that this cements the fact that there is no room in these particular people's minds for compromise and to a solution that allowed an Italian/German naming convention.  Wikipedia is NOT a democracy, and this ambush of the page to try to revert the page to a German-centric viewpoint by sending a dozen German-speaking voters here is just wrong.""",0

Hello Mr.feedhigh 
there are few things i want to make you clear
1)
why I wrote descended from """"old royal families in Nepal"""" not just Mallas is because i have some tangible evidence for this """" I myself is a newar and I think you know for a fact that most newars has an old god or a place dedicated to worship the old gods called """" Kul devta / kul devta mandir"""". Our temple is located in Balkumari hill (near Balkumari mandir in Patan) according to the """"purohit """" of the temple who also happens to be our """"purohit"""" (Sorry I can't find a good translation for this word """"purohit"""" in english) has a recorded document (I can provide the document if you like to examine it, also give you the contact address of the purohit himself, whos living near Mangal Bazzar even today) states that the """"kul devta"""" temple was erected at the time of Bhaskar verma by his second son Diwakar verma as a tribute to the god called """"Bhairav"""" and thats how were descended and still worship the same place and temple even till this day. Also according to the same purohit we adopted """"Shrestha"""" (changed from Verma) in the time of jayasthitti Malla (the reasons purohit told my there was a lot of instability in Patan and family feuds happening , but am not sure the exact reasons. If you want details, like I said I can give you the contact of  the """"purohit"""" who gave me this information you can also go to him to examine the document. Hence, this is the reason I wrote descended from old royal families in Nepal.

2)
Second you removed [during shah dynasty] yes it seems ironic serving the same people who later happen took our whole race out of power but there is a lot of history here too and history has to be written as it happened . What can i say is that you have to accept defeat sometimes , but it doesn't mean we will always be defeated , or accept that defeat for all eternity ( All I want to say is .This 2006 revolt where you probably think a  lot of Newars participated is not the only revolt that Newars has supported , if you look at history from the time of Damodar Pandey to Ranas, lot of Newars has reovlted , be it from house of Tripura from bhaktapur or others that followed it , but as always these revolt has been hijacked , for the most recent I wold like to give you the name Puspe Kamal Dahal """"prachande"""" .As always there is one prachande in the story. Like I said history has to be written as it is . I personally come from a family where my forefathers served as general and strategists for Shah Dyansty , my Great grand father was the first person to open a soda factory in Nepal ( even King Mahendra was astonished that we could make soda in Nepal) he also did a lot of things but am not here to publicize my family . What I want to remind you is that not all the Shah kings were anti Newar . There were Shah kings who patronize Newar's Arts and Language too in history. and I think we have to credit them for this and not forget them.

3) 
If you wanna have an intellectual debate am here for it , I have a good guess that you must also be a student of history like me and eventually will agree to the facts.""",0

"""taHindenburg, influenced by the Camarilla, became increasingly estranged from Brüning and pushed his Chancellor to move the government in a decidedly authoritarian and right-wing direction. This culminated, in May 1932, with the resignation of the Brüning cabinet.

Hindenburg appointed the nobleman Franz von Papen as Chancellor, heading a """"Cabinet of Barons"""". Papen was bent on authoritarian rule and, since in the Reichstag only the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) supported his administration, he immediately called for new elections in July. In these elections, the Nazis achieved their biggest success yet and won 230 seats, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag.

Knowing that it was not possible to form a stable government without Nazi support, Papen tried to persuade Hitler to become Vice-Chancellor and enter a new government with a parliamentary basis. Hitler, however, would settle for nothing less than the chancellorship. He put further pressure on Papen by entertaining parallel negotiations with the Centre Party, Papen's former party, which was bent on bringing down the renegade Papen. In both negotiations, Hitler demanded that he, as leader of the strongest party, must be Chancellor, but Hindenburg consistently refused to appoint the """"Bohemian lance corporal"""" to the chancellorship.

After a vote of no-confidence in the Papen government, supported by 84% of the deputies, the new Reichstag was dissolved, and new elections were called in November. This time, the Nazis lost some seats but still remained the largest party in the Reichstag.

After Papen failed to secure a majority, he proposed to dissolve the parliament again along with an indefinite postponement of elections. Hindenburg at first accepted this, but after General Kurt von Schleicher and the military withdrew their support

No, you're confusing """"small probability of drift"""" with """"small drift"""".  They're not the same thing.  Yes, it's less clear cut than it used to be whether drift can occur in large populations.  But when you're talking about random sampling, if there is any heterozygosity, then the probability of a change in allele frequency will never be absolutely zero.  But there are unlikely extremes allowed by any theory.  What we need to do is a better job of shading the issue.  It is absolutely true that genetic drift has traditionally been thought to be a non-issue in large populations, and that selection pressures tell the story over time.

a melancholic song about unrequited love, especially because it’s all crescendo and no denouement: Listeners never find out if the main character actually gets her wish—much less if the person she’s confessing her love to actually feels the same way. “All I Want For Christmas Is You” is a one-sided confession of wants and desires, not a song describing or celebrating a consummated relationship. “Honestly, the lyrics, to me, come off as hopelessly sad,” Williems says.  “I’ve read the critical reception section of the song’s Wikipedia page, and I can’t help but think the critics weren’t really listening. One critic seems to claim there is a ‘hint of longing,’ which might be the understatement of the century.

If you wanted to get real bummed about it, I think the argument could be made that the song is denouncing the artificiality surrounding the spectacle of Christmas,” he continues. “Saying that you are so hung up on the negative of not being with one person on Christmas that you can’t embrace the joy of the holiday is really pretty sad, but also movingly honest for a pop Christmas song.

 LOVES TO MAKE DAVID DUKE SOUND LIKE HE IS JESUS CHRIST I HAVE POSTED THE LAST ACCEPTABLE VERSION OF HIS ARTICLE!

David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

He has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. 

Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film 'Who Is David Duke?'

In the latter years of the 1980s, Duke sought to revamp his appearance by undergoing plastic surgery, and also shaved off his moustache following his election to the Lo",0

About Eddieebo's death threat to someone, I read that, you are one dumb cunt, seriously, you are fucking stupid. That was not a death threat, there are death threats and death threats, this is the former, where it says kill but everyone should know no-one is serious about it. Maybe wikipedia should wake up to themselves, unblock Eddieebo's account, he has made some useful contributions, sure he swears a lot while talking, but thats because people like you shit him up the wall to no end.

"""===Contemperary Quebec nationalism contains far too much POV===
First of all """"Anglophone Canadian nationalism""""? I think most Francophones outside of Quebec share the same Canadian nationalistic sentiment and there are still (believe it or not) many Francophones in Quebec who see themselves as being Canadian! So I do not think that Canadian Nationalism should be described as being strictly """"Anglophone"""", because it is not. 

Also when it came to the argument of Quebec nationalism being ethnic oriented as opposed to territorial I felt that again far too much POV dominated the presented thesis. The fact that study after study has shown that the vast majority of non-Francophones in Quebec, groups whose roots in the province go back just as far as the Francophones do not see themselves as being part of a Quebecois nation was ignored. So I made reference to it of course.

After reviewing the archive of this talk page, I'm pretty sure Irgendwer is a sockpuppet of , who has already been banned from this article ArbCom for trying to remove the phrase """"political philosophy"""" from the lead.. Both are obviously less than fluent in English, appear to enjoy addressing others as """"troll,"""" and have a tendency to say """"kindergarten"""" when especially annoyed by opposition to their edits. I have filed a request for CheckUser here.  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

When people are losing arguments to maintain their majority POV, they may change to denunciation and enforced law. This is exactly the sense of libertarianism not to be political.  

Do you deny that you are Alfrem?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Alfrem is obvisously a dead account. So your question makes no sense. But it makes clearly sense that you are a troll.  

I'm asking if you are the same person who edited under the account Alfrem. Yes or no?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Well, well, well.  You're quite the detecive, rehpotsirhc!  This is from Alfrem's talk page:

====Alfrem banned from Libertarianism====
Enacted on 19:58, July 13, 2005 (UTC)  

 Pending resolution of this matter  is banned from editing of Libertarianism. It shall be presumed that any user, such as  who makes Alfrem's trademark edit, removal of the phrase """"Libertarianism is a political philosophy,"""" from the article is a sockpuppet of Alfrem. Such sockpuppets may be banned indefinitely if practical.

According to this, it seems like  should be banned indefinitely if practical...   

Are you the Great Dictator?  

No.  Just extraplating from what was said about you earlier.  And, by the way, there is nothing unlibertarian about banning someone from a libertarian community who cannot abide by the rules designed to protect everyone's rights within that community.   For example, being refused entrance to a tie-required restaurant - for lack of wearing a tie - is consistent with libertarianism.   

 about me? Denunciation! Not even your term of sockpuppet is correct. And, by the way, you describe Wikipedia as your property but it is used as political public good.  

When you can spare 5 free min. within your dictatorship, you may deliver about the old question:
What is your concrete evidence that libertarianism must be described in its characteristic feature as """"political""""?
 

What would be an example if such evidence, if it were possible? You've already dismissed appeals to logic, highlighting of the prima facie indefinsibility of your position, and links from across pretty much the entirety of Western civilization. You don't even understand half of what is said here. Do you want a photograph? A mathematical proof? You made up your mind along time ago and won't listen to any other opinions. Now, are you Alfrem or not?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Yes, I am convinced that Irgendwer is Alfrem. They are both German, and they use similar mannerisms such as referring to libertarianism as """"L."""", """"kindergarten"""", etc. They make similar grammatical errors.

"""One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

The tank losses extremely biased

The Indian tank losses are exaggerated at atleast 175 tanks this means some Pakistani wants to believe that even more than 200 Indian tanks were destroyed. And the Pakistani tanks losses are put at minimal 200 tanks. The original source is US library which i dont consider as neutral at all considering the fact that US was a supporter of Pakistan. The losses dont reflect the fact that Pakistan lost almost all major battles of """"Khem Karan"""", """"Phillora"""",""""Burki"""" and even at Chawinda according to pakistan general himself pakistan lost 34 tanks(india claim 57tanks) on the other hand Pakistan exaggerate its claim to 120 tanks(India accept only 29 tanks) more importantly at Khem Karan and Phillora Indian army put on display some 100 tanks at khem karan and 58 tanks at phillora then how is it that pakistan losses are mere 200 and Indian losses """"Atleast 175"""" a complete lie. 

Spencer C Tucker one of the most renowned military historian puts pakistan losses at 300 tanks(Indian claimed 494 tanks) and Indian losses at 150 tanks(Pakistan claimed 290tanks).

 Larklight trilogy 

Hi,

Re. Larklight trilogy

I did loads of work on these articles yesterday; I fully agree that the plots are way too long and not very good; that's the main thing that needs sorting out.

I see the 'trilogy' article as having a very brief summary of each book, about 1 para.

I'm gonna put the pics back in there though - I think pics brighten up articles. Originally - before other people edited it - there was no info box, and the 3 pics were big and at the top. I'm not convinced the infobox is worthwhile for the 'trilogy' article, because it's not so appropriate to 3 books as to one - but others have added it and worked on it, so I'll go with the infobox, and the 3 pics within the 3 sections.

The user XXRonaldo007XX has tried to add an image to that infobox, which I don't think is a good idea - (s)he's a new user and struggling a bit with syntax. I'll leave him a message in a mo.

Please read and comment in Talk:Larklight where I've started a discussion on what I see as a way forward, regards structuring the articles.

Thanks for your input,

"incorrect interpretation! 

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.

If you were Catholic, would you like some Protestant insisting that you're not a Christian?  If you're protestant, would you like some Catholic asserting that you are a heretic?  These are not people who are trying to give up their Jewish heritage and become Christians (which would be tremendously easy to do, simply by converting); these are people who want to accept Christ while reaffirming their Jewishness.

This statement is incorrect. The Executive Order that Bayh passed did not require employees to join the union, nor were they ever required to join. Also, the order was passed in 1990 so it is pretty much factually incorrect. Here is the link to Executive Order 03-35, which reprints the original executive order and extends it during Kernan's governing time period. They were required to pay at most 85% of union dues due to courtcase Nass v State, which I am also including a link to.

I want to add some more details about GameSpot. When is it going to be unlocked by a SYSOP?  1 July 2005 17:06 (UTC)

Well, my name at GameSpot is The_Capitalist, and if this topic ever opens, I'll rewrite the topic. Is anyone planning to contact a Wikipedia mod? 

Um, go to the protected list and say it should be unlocked. Often the sysops just forget if no-one demands it! So do that and it'll no doubt become open very soon. Talk 5 July 2005 04:19 (UTC)

I went to the list of protected pages, but GameSpot wasn't listed. I believe that they thought they had re-opened the page, but I guess they did not. I've alerted a wikimod to the situation. - XX55XX/The Capitalist

""""GameSpot is credited with being one of the most reliable and sometimes brutally honest resources for gaming information in the Internet, leading in reviews, previews, and news coverage""""
Any sources for this? 

Read some reviews, the people at Gamespot are pretty tough. 

Anyone I know regards them as the opposite, according the gamerankings they are purely average.  

That's purely anecdotal evidence, which is useless. Go pick up a game box sometime. The developers love quoting positive reviews from Gamespot and IGN  

While it may be POV, me and everybody I know certainly believes it to be true.  

I actually don't see as many gamers trumpeting Gamespot's reviews on thier boxes as you would have us believe. I believe your opinion is just that.

I agree, it should be reworded as 'Many people see gamespot as the most brutally honest... etc... etc.. etc..', this article is full of POV information, a definite rewrite should be in order. Besides, it doesn't matter if you've been a member of GameSpot since ever, or if you even work there; the writing standards of Wikipedia still apply.

JSmith/Dmcdevit user conduct RFC draft

This is the illuminating link, beginning with """"Corrigan"""" onwards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:J.smith/YouTube_Linklist#Corrigan_article_link. The false accusation of NOR, given uncivilly, should be addressed. It was followed by the report I made at NOR (in which he 1) didn't even try to argue that there was a NOR issue after making the accusation 2) did not apologize to the accused user for the false accusation. Along with discussions at EL, it clearly demonstrates that JSmith was aware there 1) was public opposition both to the project and how it was being conducted, and 2) there was public opposition to how complaints regarding valid links were handled/how other editors were mistreated/community editing was disrespected. In spite of this public opposition, the project, how it was conducted, and how editors with objections/community editing were treated continued unchanged.

Let's summarize:

1. there was opposition to project itself/how it was conductedthe project began without consensus, against established policy.
2. there was oppostion to how users with objections regarding valid links were treated/the disruptive effect this had on community editing at numerous articles. (When politely informed *by a copyright holder* that there was no copyright issue at numerous articles, JSmith, Mimsy, Dcmcdevit continued to delete the links about which they were aware there was NO copyvio, not merely links with suspected copyviothat is a separate issue from the fact that the project was established and conducted without community consensus. (Although both are user conduct issues there is no policy dispute. Copyright policy is clear, and they made no attempt to change it/discuss changing it. They cited the EL guideline as standard justification, without consensus, and directly against consensus after it was made clear at EL that no one agreed with a blanket You Tube ban, that links should be evaluated by article editors on a case-by-case basis, via editorial judgement and consensus. The extremely troubling incidents are not the ones in which they deleted suspected copyvios (although there is opposition to that/they do not have consensus and are acting procedurally against both C and EL)the extremely troubling incidents are the ones in which they continued to delete links they KNEW were NOT copyvios,  and how they treated other editors/the community in the process (bullying, false accusations, etcDcmdevit's comments to Argyiou, JSmith's """"NOR"""") and disrupted Wikipedia in violation of WP:POINT.

 My Appeal of the Deletion of Wikipedia Page: 'Judy Wood' 

Invalid reasons given for deletion. Deleting user: Zscout370 Reasons given for deletion: User said Dr. Judy Wood is not a notable person and that my page had Copyright violations. Reasons I am appealing: Dr. Judy Wood is a notable person, because she is the ONLY 9/11 researcher to file her evidence in a court of law. One of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court! No other 9/11 researcher has accomplished so much in the pursuit of truth and justice, yet many other 9/11 researchers have their own Wikipedia pages. This is not fair. In addition, the material on her website is not only fair use since it is a public website (www.drjudywood.com), but also, I have personally contacted Dr. Judy Wood via email, and she has given me permission to use any and all of the information on her website. She has pledged to email the Wikipedia Permissions staff within 48 hours to inform them that I do indeed have permission to use the information on her webpage. Therefore, the two reasons given for deletion are invalid, and my attempts to discuss this deletion at the Talk:Judy Wood page, were also deleted! This is censorship, and it is not in the spirit of Wikipedia. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

Endorse. Clear and unambiguous copyvio.  talk 
Comment there was also an AFD in 2007  talk 

Endorse deletion - as far as I can, regardless of what is done in the future, it was a copyvio when deleted. Moreover, I see an article on this individual has already been deleted a number of times and also has subject to an AFD. I would salt the article space and tell anyone who wishes to make an article on this individual to do so in a sandbox and then get other people to assess the sources.    

Endorse deletion. Even ignoring the possible copyright problems, the article had no reliable independent sources about Judy Wood, which is a basic requirement (see e.g. WP:BIOfor more info on this).   

Response: Notability: Considering Dr. Wood is the ONLY 9/11 Researcher ever to file her evidence in a court of law, and considering that one of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court in October 2009, she is MORE notable than many 9/11 researchers that have their own pages, yet only hers seems to be deleted. When I try to input her name into the 9/11 Truth Movement wikipedia page, someone keeps deleting her name and any links to her research or court cases! This is UNFAIR, and this is not what Wikipedia is all about. Censorship and Unfairness are NOT what Wikipedia is about. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

Response: References: In addition, 3 of the 5 references used are from EXTERNAL SOURCES. 1 is from a government website, and 2 are from Academic Universities. The only 2 sources used from her website are links to the legal documents she has scanned in. Please help Wikipedia, people are trying to censor Dr. Wood, and administrators have deleted the Wikipedia page that I created! This is unfair! Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

Response: Copyright Violation: I am also NOT in Copyright violation, because her information and photos are FAIR USE and are posted Publicly, but in addition to that, she has also given me permission personally, and will be emailing the Wikipedia Permission email to alert them to this within 48 hours.''

 Obviously biased 

This article is extremely biased. Furthermore, the individuals in this video are clearly insurgents and this whole claim of """"war crimes"""" is just people trying to stir up international anger at the US military. At 1:20 you can clearly, obviously see a man with a RPG7 leaning out from around the corner of a building observing the Apache (or possibly responding to the noise of its rotors). At 2:01 before the AH-64 begins to fire you can clearly see one individual with an AKM on his shoulder and another holding to me what looks like a RPG warhead. Another is holding what some think is a camera, but it looks much more like a black case for carrying grenades or mortar rounds to me. When they zoom in at 4:03 after engaging the targets you can clearly see a Kalashnikov lying on the ground next to one of the bodies. Then a van shows up and starts loading the bodies up. Seriously, how much more clear could this be people? Why would news reporters move a van to a location they had just been SHOT AT and start loading up the bodies of insurgents they've never met before as well as two """"reporters""""?

In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.

"Millerites 

Does anyone know whether there's anything to the claim that the Millerites (presumably adherents of Millerism) were interested in Cantor's work?  For me, a web search doesn't find much, and one of the things it does find is the same claim in this article from several years back.

So there seem to be several possibilities:
 Just a hoax, with a persistent perpetrator.

 An actual tidbit about the Millerites, potentially sourceable if we found the right sources.

Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

This is a very short summary of the Grammar, which can be read thoroughly in the external links. In fact, I can't really understand why there are already articles about Breathanach, Brithenig, DiLingo, Enochian, Fyksland, Talossan language, Verdurian language, Wenedyk and many others, and there can't be an article about Aingelja.

I wait for instructions about what I should change in the article style, but I repeat that I can't understand your reaction.

Dennis, I'd really love to hear an answer as to why my Coal edits are relevant here. I've stopped editing coal, and this consitutesDouble Jeopardy since I've already been punished for this and have done nothing since then. 

Dan is also missspeaking when he says there were 4 blocks, there were 3, and one """"change of block settings"""". Unless """"words no longer have meaning"""" to quote that great curmudgeon Antonin Scalia, that means there were 3 blocks, not 4. And this one is somewhat strange since I seem to be getting blocked again for the same problem. Obviously my edits have improved from my first week at the encylopedia, but I keep getting unloaded on for my youthful indiscretions. Also, Flyer22 has been following me around reverting my edits since I first did her the indignity of adding a minor, brief, referenced note on Sigmund Freud's theories to her beloved childhood page, which has little to no useful philosophical material, and yet is classed as a high importance, low quality philosophy, with begging for improvement (""""If you can improve this page, please do so. It has little or no material"""") then afterwards, she began to follow me around to other philosophy pages, and reverting my work with dishonest comments in the edit summary given as reasons. Yes, I did get annoyed at this, but I think it was rather uncivil to tell a new editor that their edits are """"poor, pure and simple"""" don't you? Especially when she doesn't seem to actually posssess any abiding interest in the topics I edit other than the fact that they are my topics, and she wishes to see me be annoyed and removed from editing this website? I'd really like a response, Dan, since I don't see how the coal quotations from prior to my previous block are germane at all here.   """,0

""""I think we probably share the view that the 'energy comparison' section is poorly written and sourced."""" - we can agree on that, but i would make the point that we should make the best of what we have until better information/models become available.

""""my problem with the AGA document is that it's very misleading and should not be included for that reason""""  - my answer is that the document does not really contain errors but contains some spin as you would expect from the manufacture however the spin is obvious and most people would be able to extract useful information from it despite its flaws. I would argue that reference 3 is also misleading as the data models presented there are to simplistic and will mislead people so using you own argument if you exclude reference 5 then you should also exclude reference 3. Energy models are inherently complex beasts and very simple representations such as 3 contribute nothing but confusion to the debate.

""""Your complaint about a supposed 'Green rant' indicates that you do not have a neutral view"""" - you are reading to much into that comment. Its a response to the fact that the media that I read seems to be full of half baked green ideas which don't add up either from a technical or a mathematical point of view. As a trained engineer I am only interested in arguments that make sense from a technical view not fantasy land arguments that seem to require 1+1 to = something other than 2!

If you read the comment is fee website where Monobiot writes you will see something like 5 to 7 pages of comment on his article almost all critical about his article. The most common one was that he was not comparing like with like. Monobiot makes a lot of interesting points ( I have just read his book HEAT) but when it comes to technical details he is out of his depth and frequently gets things wrong. Read the site for more detail.  

""""But do you not see the difference between marketing spin by AGA, and reliable, referenced data?"""" - yes of course - so provide some - I dont think this article cirrently contain any. It contains information but i dont think is very good information. 

""""For example, you have plucked a figure of 30 years out of somewhere"""" its either in that article or another one on the AGA or Rayburn web sites. When considering some of the costs you have to remember that AGA last a very long time 
so costs and gains have to be considered over a longer time scale than you would for a cheap chinese electric oven which would have to be replaced 3-4 times over the same period.

""""conventional ovens is worse than dismal"""" - I don't agree that that has been proven, the indications are that it is not very good in some circumstances but i think that dismal is to hard a term and yet to be proven. You cant consider thenal devices such as a AGA without considering how they are used. For instance consider 2 AGA , a 2 oven model in a single person household and a 4 Oven model in a nursing home. The first would be a disaster preparing maby only one hot meal a day, while the other would be on the go 24x7x365. Both are AGA, the first setup would be crazy, the second is a market that actually buys large numbers of AGA and they are commercial institutions for the most part, they are run by hard nosed managers and yet they buy tons of AGA why is that if they are as bad as you say? What do you know that all these hard nosed money pinchers don't? I suspect that answering the question for the AGA is very much more than straight KwH

BYW I dont have an AGA or expect to ever own one - I am interested in engineering soultions to global warming ( real solutions not 10:10 stuff) but i dont understand why this whole """"lets bash teh AGA"""" thing that seems to be going on at the moment is coming from?

""""Could you perhaps list this annual expenditure for clarity?"""" you should address that question to the authors of the article I dont know?

My Offer Anent My Unblock
I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of """"trolling and harassment"""", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.

History
From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.
My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. 

I returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to """"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for """"trolling and harassment"""". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.

I returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, """"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?"""" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.

Declarations
I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.
I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.
I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:
Bode Miller
Julia Mancuso
Shaun White
Ted Ligety
Purna
Akola city
2010 Winter Olympics
And many more. . .
I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.

Final Thoughts
The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.
To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you """"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock"""". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?
I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.
I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.
I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark",0

"""

ONIH has not addressed the issue, and he has also not answered my question.  

1. I said small would be more appropriate relative to """"minor"""" - """"""""Minor"""" reflects a point of view. """"Small"""" would be more appropriate.""""  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The """"movement"""" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.

2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a """"mere journalist.""""  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase """"mere journalist."""" 

I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, """"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.""""  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, """"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.""""  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).  

3. One Night In Hackney states above that he """" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.""""  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, """"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.""""  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word """"twenty"""" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.

4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.

 Poisoning the well 

This refers to an old comment you made, but which I just now saw? Could you please refrain from commenting on people's supposed motives and stick to the value of their actual comments? You are suggesting that people's opinions can be dismissed becaues they have initiated a lot of AfD's, and/or haven't created enough articles (an argument you wisely did not use in my case, since I created a lot more articles than you did, and none are """"articles"""" which should never have been created in the first place and are now cross-namespace redirects like Association of Inclusionist Wikipedians and Constructionism and reductionism (wiki).) 

You claim in that diff that """"a policy which encourages editors to work together before deleting would hinder what editors who delete other editors hard work are trying to doing here"""": thanks for the blatant mischaracterization. I have worked together with many, many editors, and have achieved great results in doing so. I have also tried to upheld Wikipedia's policies in all cases, both when I deleted articles or nominated them for deletion, but also when I denied speedies, restored pages, or suggested to keep articles in AfD debates. Many of the AfD's I started were not """"other editor's hard work"""" but blatant hoaxes, copyright violations, and so on. Other's were about someone's hard work, which was just not suited for WIkipedia. We are not a free webhost, even though we have nearly unlimited space: we are an encyclopedia, and not everything is suited for inclusion. To decide what is and isn't suited, we have discussions, and I abide by the consensus if it follows our core policies (I have , if I recall correctly, never started a DRV when an AfD by me did not end in a delete, and I have also tried to incorporate the decision from one AfD in my next nominations).

 The criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed. 

The criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed. For example, it starts off by quoting (and uses heavily throughout) the white supremacist Tomislav Sunić, who other people may think of as a reliable source, but I most certainly do not. Here are his thoughts on Jews.  I hope you have a stronger stomach for that filth than I do - I stopped reading about halfway down. More about Sunić: """"In June 2008, the group hosted Tomislav Sunic, a former Croatian diplomat and the author of the anti-Semitic book Homo Americanus: Child of the Post-Modern Age, which argues that """"Americanism,"""" heavily influenced by Judaism, undermines traditional European morality.  """"On June 24, about 40 people attended a talk by Pacifica Forum speaker Tomislav Sunic, who only three days earlier had addressed the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) at its national """"leadership conference"""" in Sheffield, Ala. Sunic, a writer and white nationalist, had previously spoken to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of the CCC and the Institute for Historical Review (at least twice). He appeared on the """"Political Cesspool,"""" a white nationalist radio show, and was interviewed extensively for David Duke's Internet radio program. Sunic and the former Klan boss (whose latest book is entitled Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question) commiserated about Jewish domination, low birth rates among people of European ancestry and discrimination against whites. """"Especially in these multiracial cities, like L.A. or Washington D.C., I'm losing my eye contact,"""" Sunic confessed to Duke. """"I'm sort of afraid even of raising my head and looking at people right in their eyes because I know they may not be of my species."""" .

The criticism section also relies heavily on Rummel, about whom we should maintain a high degree of scepticism. To quote Tomislav Dulić, """"the estimates used by Rummel for Tito’s Yugoslavia cannot be relied upon, since they are largely based on hearsay and unscholarly claims frequently made by highly biased authors"""". .

It then goes on to say that """"The Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia, an office of the Slovenian Government whose task is to find and document mass grave sites from the Second World War and the period immediately after it, discovered at least 581 mass graves in the Slovenian territories [65] which “are believed to hold up to 100,000 bodies”[66] killed under Tito's government"""". None of this is true. The CCMGS has compiled a list of 581 sites which it believes worthy of inspection under the terms of its mandate. It has investigated just a few of these, and even where it has started to investigate, progress has been slow to say the least. For example, at Tezno, 1,179 bodies were discovered in 1999 (despite the wild speculation by the likes of Dežman and Ferenc about 15,000 bodies, so eagerly reported in the media), and at Barbara rov 300 bodies. That is not to say how many bodies will eventually be found - nobody knows - but what the article currently says is absolutely untrue. 

Finally, it gives mention to Bernard Meares, of whom I have no criticism - I'm sure he's a fine man - but is he the best you can do? He """"has lived in Trieste for some years, as a translator of the CERN Institute of Geneva"""".  Wow. 

There's not much else in the criticism section. Unless you lot can come up with better than this in terms of sources, then it should be removed.   """,0
"""

 Thanks for removing the critique. However this one: """"On 8 December 1925, the Turkish Ministry of Education issued an order banning the use of ethnic terms such as Kurd, Circassian, Laz, Kurdistan and Lazistan."""" is not sourced. Should find a source and also explain that the Minister of Education's ban only applies to Public Schools. Something like """"On 8 December 1925, the Turkish Ministry of Education issued an order banning the use of ethnic terms such as Kurd, Circassian, Laz, Kurdistan and Lazistan in public school curricula"""".  That'll keep it short and save me from inserting counter-claims and explnations. Sound good?  """,0

As to the WP:HEAR ...I attempted to find out the rationale for a block from Gwen Gale.

However the reviewing admin, gave their clear reasons why they reversed it.  Instead of jumping to the next level after my block was reversed, I did ask Gwen Gale why I was blocked, I did this professionally and properly on her talk page, as she had suggested to do exactly this before.

 Gwen as an administrator never implied she felt harassed and in fact said subsequently said she was """"not bothered"""" by my inquiry on the talkpage. (see: Trolling http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gwen_Gale )

Brews, he's given citations for the very things that I have been arguing about. Polar coordinates in the inertial frame are the correct and standard way to analyze planetary orbital motion.

The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory. I mentioned Goldstein's.

I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.

I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.

And in true schoolboy style, anything that they can't understand must go to the trash can.  05:22",0

Both are organisations which form part of the wider 'EU' which is what we have written about in this article, not simply the definition in the treaty on european union. My primary consideration is to what extent any of these organisations are independent of the member states, not of each other.

That's a very a-historical point of view. The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.

It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding. Sure you can believe some words are """"from God"""" but not know what they mean, but then you don't believe the doctrine you believe that there are some words that are true.

Apparently you didn't read what Augustine wrote. Let me refresh your memory...
""""Your today yields not with tomorrow, for neither does it follow yesterday. Your today is eternity; therefore You begat the Co-eternal, to whom You said, 'This day have I begotten Thee.' Thou hast made all time; and before all times You are, nor in any time was there not time.""""

Augustine directly links God being external to time with the begetting of the Son. Now if you have a  different point of view, prove it! Otherwise it is just hand-waving and show.

People are interested in the relationship between biblical doctrine and science. What is the problem with a ONE LINE reference?

There's plenty of people thinking about this issue. Lewis is a published theologian is he not? Here is a paper from a college dealing with it....

The doctrine of the church is important, but what it means is irrelevant? Come on!! Why look up Wik if not to find out what something means? You don't need Wik to read the Athanasian creed. You need Wik to *understand* it in its historical context.

> To answer your first question, the Church defines which beliefs are dogma

Then point me to where I can buy a book or books which is the final word on Christian dogma. Then I can verify for myself what parts of this article are dogma and which are opinion. Don't say the bible because it doesn't mention eternal generation.

>For Orthodox at least, it's a """"theological opinion"""" that Mary lived a sinless 
>life

Ah huh! But for Catholics it is DOGMA. Thus what is and isn't dogma the OPINION of different churches and persons.

At the end of the day folks, I have taken a quote from a church father that directly addresses the issue of """"eternally begotten"""" to explain to the reader the meaning. To take it down you would have to show either

a) Augustine was out of step with the rest of the church at this point.
b) The church was so confused, there are too many theories to discuss.

But to just say """"let it be a mystery! Don't tell them what it means!"""", sorry that doesn't wash.

"""
Enric, you present an impoverished idea of what Wikipedia editors can and should do. We do not report demonstrably false information as fact just because a reliable source says it, unless we balance it. We can and should balance secondary source error with primary source fact. The requirement is that the primary source facts reported should be directly verifiable without synthesis, by any ordinary person with ordinary skill applying reasonable effort. First of all, it's worth reading WP:OR over carefully. Then look at the essay linked from the WP:OR page, WP:NOTOR. See, specifically, this example:
A book, short story, film, or other work of fiction is a primary source for any article or topic regarding that work. Anything that can be observed by a reasonable person simply by reading the work itself, without interpretation, is not original research, but is reliance upon a primary source. This would include direct quotes or non interpretative summaries, publication dates, and any other patent information that can be observed from the work. For example, if there are multiple versions of a particular story, and one version does not have a particular character, or has extra characters, that is clear simply by reading or watching the work. The fact that one would have to read or watch the whole thing does not make the matter original research. The work is verifiable, even if it takes more time than flipping to a single page.
Notice that the example is quite on point here: After reporting what the DoE report says is claimed in the review document about the sixteen samples, 'blah blah.' we could say, """"The Hagelstein paper, which was the review document, does not contain a report of 'blah blah.' However, it does contain 'bleep bleep.'"""" And there is probably more than we can say; there is some criticism of the 2004 report in reliable source, if I'm correct. This tidbit, however, requires no source other than the 2004 DoE material.
Notice also that we probably cannot report, for example, that """"The 2004 DoE report contradicted itself,"""" unless we have secondary source on that. What we properly do is to present the elements of the (alleged) contradiction, without claiming contradiction, reliably sourced, and let the reader form his or her own conclusion. The elements are directly verifiable. The conclusion isn't.   """,0

Do prototypes necessarily use a sort of """"prototyping"""" material? Aren't models made of a different material called a mockup or something of the sort? In that case, the chef example above doesn't work - the new creations are prototypes. 
As for the others, the newspaper industry does use prototypes. That is, the first version referred to above. The first version is the definition of prototype - the prototype is the first version.
The coal industry could benefit greatly from prototypes, and I'm sure they use them already. There are immense safety concerns, to name one only area in which a model, perhaps not full-sized, of a coal mine would work. Additionally, the coal mines themselves are not the only asset of the coal industry - you have countless types of vehicles, mining equipment, and support equipment.
Milking cows - there would of course be no cow prototypes, as cows are not the product of the dairy industry. Instead, milk is. And I would hope there is prototype milk - a sample of the milk throughout its development cycle to make sure it is safe and clean.
As for pet stores, it is right that they would doubtless have a need for a prototype. However, a prototype is used for a product. A pet store has no """"products"""", instead they offer a service. They do not produce pets, they recieve and sell them. Even pet breeders do not produce the pets, they just reap the benefits of reproduction.

"""== Art of War ==

Thanks for being so understanding.  I hope you decide to stick around.  Regarding The Art of War (disambiguation), there is already a link to Sun-Tzu's book, which El Norte Press has simply issued in a new edition.  WP:DISAMBIG covers the sorts of things that are appropriate for disambiguation pages; since we wouldn't have a whole article on a single edition of a book, we wouldn't mention it on the disambiguation page.  But please feel free to contribute to Wikipedia in other ways.  And (ironic as it might sound now), ignore all rules:  if you do something wrong, someone else will come along and fix it!  ' TalkContribs 

 Ah, I had missed that you had said Mao's Art of War, not Sun Tzu's.  Still, Mao never wrote a book called The Art of War.  The El Norte Press edition is a compilation of four separate treatises.  They would be notable individually, but none would be linked to the Art of War disambiguation page since none of them shares that title, nor could the El Norte edition be advertised on any of the articles devoted to one of those four treatises (e.g., On Protracted War). ' TalkContribs 

 There is a difference between editions that on their own satisfy the requirements of WP:N and the insertion of information about a specific edition into articles about a book.  A more specific notability guideline is available at WP:NB.  Since The Art of War (disambiguation) is not a heavily-edited page, leaving this to another editor to correct does not seem likely to resolve this problem.  If you like, you can request a third opinion, which would bring others into the discussion.  ' TalkContribs 

 Thanks for your note.  While anything written by Mao Zedong would count as notable, a collection of his writings, assembled under a title that he never chose, would not be.  It is for this reason that I am loathe to include The Art of War as one of Mao's writings or to put it on the disambiguation page.  One thing that caught my eye was your claim that this work is referenced in scholarly papers.  That would be a sign of notability.  Did Mao ever publish these works together as unit under the title, The Art of War? Who has discussed the works by this title? ' TalkContribs 

 Thank you again for your comments.  The fact that this edition appears in the footnote of an unpublished paper does not make it notable; blogs are not reliable sources, either.  You mention that this book is used at West Point.  I would correct you to say that this edition has been ordered by the West Point bookstore; the book in question does not exist — except as a creation of El Norte Press.  You mention your expertise:  expert editors addresses this issue, so we don't have to throw our credentials on the table.  If you wish to pursue this further, the link for a third opinion is above.

""" (UTC)

This debate is essentially about what can be stated unqualifiedly as fact. The consensus definition of fact is """"something that can be demonstrated to be true"""", in other words, """"something based on empirical evidence"""". I think that most dissenters would acknowledge that their views are not by this definition """"fact"""", that is, they would not claim that their views are """"built on empirical evidence"""". Frankly, the definition of fact is very much linked with the definition of science, as the goal of science is the establishment of fact. Thus, statements about which there is no fact-based debate, such as the roundness of the earth, can be stated as fact. Non-fact-based dissenting views can be stated as dissenting views, preferably in their own articles to avoid confusing the fact-seeking encyclopedia user.
The alternative, as far as I can figure, is to not state anything at all as fact, which would make Wikipedia a useless hellish cauldron of boiling fat. As one who believes that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia, this isn't a very attractive prospect. If anyone can think of a different way to determine what can be stated as fact, go right on ahead.   07:41, 29 January 2006""",0

 Race and Intelligence: Asian-Americans 

I've noticed you've contributed much to the race/intelligence articles and thought these articles might interest you:

http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90354

""""Using data from recent Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study compares third-and-higher 
generation with earlier generation Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites in terms of 
socioeconomic characteristics and demographics. The findings suggest a “third-generation 
decline or flattening” for Asian American and white men as well as Asian American and white 
women. For each of these groups, the mean of years of schooling among the 2.5 and third 
generations is lower than among the first and second generations. This pattern is most 
pronounced among Asian Americans. As for wage determination, the generational differentials 
can be explained by educational attainment and other basic demographic variables. Overall, these 
results suggest that assimilation beyond the first generation immigrants no longer improves 
socioeconomic attainments as expected by traditional assimilation theory. Furthermore, in the 
case of Asian Americans, cultural assimilation across the generations may actually lower 
educational attainment and thereby reduce wages contrary to traditional assimilation theory.""""

""""It is widely noted that Asian immigrant parents have higher educational and socioeconomic 
expectations and motivations for their children than do non-Hispanic white parents (e.g., Goyette 
and Xie 1999; Kao 1995, 2004). Asian families also tend to invest more aggressively in 
financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups (e.g., 
Sun 1998). Yet, protective effects of ethnic cultures and resources decline according to more 
acculturation into the mainstream U.S. society (e.g., Kao and Tienda 1995). As third-or-higher 
generation Asians become more “Americanized,” they tend to embrace the prevailing U.S. norm 
that as long as good efforts have been made based on one’s ability, the outcome would be 
acceptable even though one has not achieved the best performance or reached a higher level of 
education (Chen and Stevenson 1989; Stevenson 1988).""""

Likewise...

http://www.ibtimes.com/asian-americans-increasingly-defying-stem-stereotype-246578

""""Shinagawa pointed out another interesting phenomenon; later generation (second, third, fourth, etc.) Asian Americans on average have markedly lower education and income compared to immigrant Asians.

In 2007, 33 percent of PhDs conferred in the U.S. were to Asians. However, of that 33 percent, only 2 percent were Asians Americans born or raised in the U.S.""""

These trends are reflected in their TIMSS/PIRLS scores, which are often used by people like Charles Murray and Richard Lynn as proxies for IQ.

http://i39.tinypic.com/zob4p0.png

Note that native born Asian-Americans perform worse than native born Whites in every subject.

My goal here is not to put down Asian-Americans, but I've noticed that lots of modern racialists like to use Asians as a battering ram against other minorities. Yet, as the above evidence indicates, even """"model minorities"""" who start from a much more advantageous position than the others can still succumb to negative cultural influences which significantly hurt their academic performance. This suggests that culture does, indeed, matter greatly, even on exams like the TIMSS which supposedly test for 'g'. 

If you have any contacts with academics in the field, perhaps you'd like to pass this information along? James Flynn who wrote an entire book on Asian-Americans might be particularly interested.""",0

 Where do these concepts come from? 

The article was recently revised to say that Old Town is """"in Williamson County, near Franklin"""" (no longer """"in"""" Franklin) and that the mound complex """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""" (no longer simply """"on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""").

I'm puzzled by these changes, which aren't sourced. My investigations (call them """"original research"""") using online maps do indicate that Old Town is in northwestern Williamson County, near Franklin, but not inside the current city limits or even in the urban growth boundary. Thus, I think the geographic location is OK, even though sources have placed it """"in"""" Franklin. 

Let me get this straight.  You want to use insulting language about the edits, but then agree that they are factually correct.  Where is the OR?  I disagree that it is OR to state that the location is in Williamson County.  Whether or not it is currently in the current city limits is a factual matter that I am not actually sure about, but in the historic sweep it is correct to say that the location is near Franklin (think of Franklin having been a small town at one time).  It is """"near"""" Franklin, meaning it is not in modern downtown Franklin.  I see no OR.  

However, I can't agree with """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""". First off, what is later than """"is""""? It appears to me that the mound complex """"is"""" alongside the Harpeth River and """"is"""" on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace. I surmise that the intent was to say that the site was not on a branch of the Natchez Trace when the mound complex was built, but I don't buy that. First off, the previous version of the article never said that the mound complex was built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace; it merely said that it's there now. Secondly, I'm not aware of any source indicating that the mound complex was not built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace. Notwithstanding whatever the current version of the [[Natchez Trace[[ article, it's my understanding (based on diverse sources) that the Trace (which is an interconnected collection of trails, not a single trail) existed for centuries before white people laid eyes on Tennessee, and that archaeologists who have investigated Old Town assume that it was located where it is because of the river, the Trace, and the crossing of Brown's Creek. If the intent was to say that the Trace did not exist when the mound complex was built, I see that as a piece of WP:OR that's inconsistent with many sources.   

Those amendments to the article were in 2 edits, the main one with edit summary """"revise about assertion of location, avoiding unnecessary disclosure and avoiding synthesis (e.g. about 2 creeks being the same, not in a source AFAIK). Drop dup cat."""".  Funny you should be making accusations of original research.  I think the wp:OR accusation should apply more strongly to the previous language, which included wp:OR in the form of synthesis (wp:SYNTH?) about which creek is what (and the synthesis ends up disclosing more about location than is necessary).  I think that """"the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" refers pretty clearly to that branch of the 1800's Natchez Trace, which served as path/roadway for return upstream of persons who had brought rafts or barges down the Mississippi to New Orleans.  The other branch is known as the Ridge Route or something like that and is covered in a different NRHP listing.  These two distinct branches are known in history and described in historical documents, including being described in Williamson County MRA and other documents that Orlady has read.  To refer to the prehistoric mounds having been built along the 1800s-era historic """"Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" is wp:OR, wp:SYNTH, ahistorical, sloppy, generally bad, in poor taste, and whatever else sounds negative, more so than the language which replaced the original language.

OR is bad.  OR was removed by the edits.  OR was not introduced by the edits.  Yay!  Glad we are all agreed.  I am sure there are improvements to the language which can be made, but I would prefer not to argue small wording changes until the bigger article structure questions being discussed above are settled.  Or until Orlady agrees to allowing a third party to judge on wording, and replies about participating in mediation to address the long pattern of conflict. ncram """,0

Actually ethnicity and culture are not good arguments considering the 70% of Taiwanese are Hoklos and 15% Hakka, both classified as a branch of Southern Han, while the rest is 12% various mainlanders and 3% mixed/Aborigines. Culturally, they're a typical East Asian nation.
The reason why they're separate is because they were founded by the refugees of the ROC, making them a separate nation.

"Intro

This is the intro which was on the Palpatine page for a very long time:

Once an ambitious Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Palpatine is leader of the Galactic Republic at the time of the Clone Wars, and later is the man who becomes the Emperor. Ultimately, Palpatine is revealed to be the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of immense power and immeasurable cunning.

yesterday, user Robeykr changed it to this:

Once an ambitious yet unassuming Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic shortly before the time of the Clone Wars, and later became absolute leader of the most crushing totalitarian government in the history of the galaxy. Ultimately, it was revealed that Palpatine was the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of enormous power and considerable cunning.

I changed it back, and tried to clean it up a little:

Once a Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Palpatine is leader of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and later becomes Galactic Emperor. Ultimately, Palpatine is revealed to be the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of immense power and immeasurable cunning.

I cited the need for reversion as a) the intro needs to be short b) it should be NPOV

I would like to know what people think about the changes so that hopefully we can resolve this.",0

Don't you understand that what is commonly called """"Nazi Punk"""" doesn't have to mean one being politically a National Socialist? If you bother to read the first paragraph in the article, Punk bands and individuals who are """"believers in extreme Nationalism, Fascism, Racialism, or National Socialism"""" are considered """"Nazi Punks"""". A.B.H. were White Power (racialists) and extremely Nationalistic at one point in their career and therefore, by Wikipedia (and common scene) definition, a Nazi Punk band. They fall under two of the qualifications. I know that a lot of people like A.B.H. and have an interest in others not thinking they were White Nationalists, but the fact remains they were at one point, despite the fact they later changed their views. Perhaps putting a side-note saying that the band later changed their views should be added, but that's it. This article is a historical look at the Nazi Punk (i.e. Racist Punk) subculture and white washing certain band's histories isn't right and should not be tolerated. I'm re-adding them.

 Hello.  Thanks.  First, if you want to chat with me, please reply at my Talk Page - not at yours.  I check my Talk Page every day and see the new postings.  I certainly do not check your Talk Page every day to see if you posted anything there.  My Talk Page is at this link here > User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro.  Second, per Wikipedia rules, I am not giving any legal advice at all, just trying to answer a semantics question.  Third, remember that the situation and laws are different all over the place.  I am in the USA and answering as such ... I have no idea where you are located, and if it is within or outside the USA.  So, all of that being said ... I can now answer your latest follow-up questions.  Let me address the first part of your question, which states: """"one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.""""  In a one word answer, yes.  But, the way that your follow-up question is worded, it seems like you are mixing apples and oranges  that is, confusing very different things.  I guess I am not sure what you mean by """"terminating"""" a contract?  The contract itself usually has dates within it, such as """"This contract runs from January 1, 2008, and will expire on December 31, 2008.""""  So, you never """"terminate"""" that contract  it just """"dies"""" on December 31, 2008.  If you want to """"break"""" (""""stop"""") the contract before the ending date of December 31, that's a different story - and it would depend on why (what reasons) you want to not finish out the whole year-contract.  As you refer to, some contracts will have explicit terms within them that delineate when/where/how/why the contract may be terminated.  Some contracts have no dates in them, correct.  And, within them, there will be (there should be) certain reasons as to when / how / why either party may """"end"""" the contract.  But, in a one-word simplistic answer ... yes, one is free to terminate such a contract for whatever reasons are permitted or not forbidden within that contract.  Let me address the second part of your question, which states: """"one cannot legitimately accuse the contractee of 'insubordination' ...""""  Again, you are mixing apples and oranges.  So, it is a hard question to answer.  In a simple answer, the answer is ... maybe yes and maybe no.  If any terms of the contract deal with """"insubordination"""", then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other party of insubordination.  For example, a contract may state: """"If Party A does not report to the work site prior to 9 AM, that will be considered insubordination"""" ... or """"If Party B does not submit the appropriate paper work at the end of the day, that action will be considered insubordination"""" ... or something like that.  So, if the terms of the contract deal with insubordination, then - yes, one party may certainly accuse the other of insubordination.  Now, let's say that the contract does not in any way mention insubordination.  (This is probably the likely case that you are referring to.)  Then, in terms of semantics (that is, language and wording) ... then, no  one party may not accuse the other of insubordination.  But, really, they can accuse the other party of breaching the terms of the contract ... that is, not meeting up with their end of the bargain in the contract.  So, the real and correct words (semantics) would be that one party accuses the other of either: breaching (breaking) the contract ... or ... not complying with the terms and consitions of the contract ... or words like that.  Those essentially mean the same thing as the concept of insubordination (not doing what you are supposed to do and expected to do, when asked to do so).  But, you just would not use the word insubordination.  You would use the word """"violating our contract"""".  But, in spirit, it all means the same thing.  So, if I was the party to the contract .... and the other party accused me of """"insubordination"""" ... and our contract terms never mention insubordination ... then, I would take that to mean that the other party is accusing me of not adhering to the terms of the contract and he is simply using the wrong jargon ... but he may (or may not) be wrong in principal and substance.  In other words, just because the other party used the wrong/incorrect word (he improperly used the incorrect word of insubordination), that doesn't change the fact that maybe, yes, I did do something wrong and I did go against the contract.  I hope this all helps.  Please reply at my Talk Page.  Maybe if you make your question a little more clearer and detailed, I can craft a better answer.  Thanks.  (  )""",0

A reply to the argument that Benazir Bhutto mispoke

Benazir was a highly intelligent, highly educated and ex-prime minister.  She is not George Bush.  She does not mispeak.  This is the biggest thing since watergate.  The proof that this is a cover up is shown by the following facts:

i) the experienced reporter David Frost who was interviewing Benazir when she """"slipped out"""" the fact that Bin Laden was murdered did not follow up on it.  In fact he looked palpably irritated and wondering quite how to paper over the issue.  He is in on the game, clearly.  If he was not in on the game then he would have pinned her down on this sensational bit of news.  

ii) Benazir was murdered in a wet job (this is a technical term) about a month after she mentioned that Omar Sheikh (note the triangle of first letters in history) was involved in Bin Laden's assasination.

iii) Nobody in the world's media picked up on a story that Bin Laden was murdered.

So blanket world media silence on the possibility of Bin Laden being dead.  I kinda have a source inside who confirms this.  Acutally it was years ago and not Omar Sheikh, but letters in names can sometimes be telling three times.""",0

FPC for Kurando-san
I've noticed your bot has been moving FPC older than 14 days.  Would it be possible to extend its operations on FPC?  I understand that it wouldn't be able to determine if an image should become featured, but it could do the rest.  What I was thinking was this:
For old nominations, we can manually determine if it should be promoted, and place the phrase """"PROMOTED FILENAME.JPG"""" or """"NOT PROMOTED"""" on a new line in that subpage, and move the link to the subpage to the bottom of the current archive (link to that archive is determined by: [[Wikipedia:Featured pictures candidates/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}-{{CURRENTYEAR}}]]
Your bot could then determine if it was promoted or not, and do the following:
If the image in that subpage has {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} in its summary, remove that tag and replace with {{FeaturedPicture}}, else just add the {{FeaturedPicture}} tag. Any other images displayed on the subpage should have their {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} removed if present.
Add the following new line to Wikipedia:Goings-on, below the line which reads '''[[Wikipedia:Featured pictures|Pictures]] that gained """"featured"""" status'''
*[[:Image:FILENAME.JPG|NAME_OF_SUBPAGE]] ({{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}})
(where NAME_OF_SUBPAGE is the name of the subpage where the FPC took place, without the prefixed text: Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/
Add the following new line to Wikipedia:Featured pictures thumbs, below the first occurrence of > on the page:

Determine the person who nominated the image by either grabbing their first sig on the subpage, or (probably better) grabbing the first edit of that subpage
Determine the person who uploaded the image (probably should use the most recent upload of the file; the one at the top).
Add the following new lines to the bottoms of these two individual's talk pages:

If the subpage says """"NOT PROMOTED"""", remove the {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} from any of the images displayed on that subpage (people might on occasion link to an image, so be careful; [[:Image versus [[Image ).

This would cut our workload by a large amount, and all we would have to do is make sure we put """"PROMOTED FILENAME.JPG"""" or """"NOT PROMOTED"""" at the end of the subpage, and list the promoted pic on Wikipedia:Featured pictures visible and Wikipedia:Featured pictures.

"""Well, I do interpret that as """"apology"""" that is not entirely, not quite; though, maybe, nearly.

You have put extensive effort into it however, which might indicate some sincerity, even if I feel further  insulted.

So, as another problem w/ this website, you might just not comprehend many features of what I have been saying about the website's features.

Or, maybe you like having me typewrite f/ several hours extra, as I've already proclaimed that it's excruciating.

This may not be accurate; but, very little of what you,  many of you, say about me is anywhere close to accurate:  I feel as if I, me, am fighting from w/in my disabilities, on the largest website, aside from  searchengines, against several thousand members of an  oligarch   plutocrat   overclass, with the wealth to purchase a new machine, w/ the best programming, every time a new  television commercial  flashes.

Again, that may not be accurate; but, that is how it seems.

Through nearly two years, I've fought through many misperceptions.  Several of you have insisted on """"brain damaged"""".  One  aqua  has insisted that I'm too European, something that it had found on another website about France, Italy.

Now, role has insisted that I'm too American, despite what I've written about  bbcamerica, & that I do not comprehend a clock, nor a  calendar.

You've deleted my response to those attacks; you've deleted my plea for more description of the wings.   Your deletion converted role's attacks into libel.  Minor, virtually insignificant libel; but, libel  nonetheless.

&, with all of the other libel that you, all of you, have attacked me with, for two years, how else might I stop it?

As long as you insist that you were correct all along, that  obviates all  apology:

  I would urge you not to remove other's {others'} comments with a summary of """"libel"""" unless they really are. I still don't see any libel in them.

That sentence means that you assert the right to  label, including  libel.  That is not apology.

First you have me too European, then too American, both as insults,..... libel.

If someone offers an apology, then virtually completely contradicts it, well, what is that?

When I had heard  Peter_Burkill's name, I had input his name, immediately, on this website.  That brought me to that page.  I had recalled another crash long ago.  I'd, eventually, confirmed the name, through some searches,  Alfred_Haynes.  I wanted to assert a connection there, & honor them.

You can clearly see when I'd learned of  Eric_Moody,  John_Coward.  Each of those names are rather ironic, considering who they are, in reality.

Why does what I've said of the wings  offend you such that you cannot even acknowledge that I've said it many, many times over?

Well, I know, factually, that I've read several messages, pining f/ a way, to trick me off, force me off, otherwise get rid of,.....

Well, one specific method to reduce the time that I have to scribe on this website would also be positive: if I could figure how to start one, or more, of my own.  It is obvious that many of you do not prefer positive  modi operandi.  But, however, maybe one of you, @ least one, is truly positive, & sufficiently  knowledgeable.

If any of you are positive, yet approximately as  ignorant  as I am, I would accept, welcome, your assistance anyhow.

""":You said: """"I am determined that the page will not regress to this again, and I will delete anything inappropriate that jeopardizes the good progess that is now being made. A completely inappropriate post in the middle of a sensitive discussion threatens to do just that.""""  The problem is that you are not the sole arbiter of this (or any) talk page. The post was innocuous and did not violate the conditions of the arbitration decision. Nor did it affect the flow of discussion on the page. In fact the most appropriate response would have been to just ignore it.  By removing it you just encourage a reaction.  You accuse me of wikilawyering, which is absurd. The guidelines are there to help us all. However, not only do you violate that guideline, but also several policies.  It is this kind of heavy handed action that encourages people to persist with problem edits. It is a long-standing convention that we do not remove other users posts and in my three years here I have never seen it done when it wasn't vandalism.  Unless you can give me a much better reason for not doing so, I am going to reinstate the deleted text.

What would really help would be a degree in paleontology with taphonomy.

""""Fossilization requires rapid burial, or the organism will decay.  This suggest that a catastrophe is responsible for the fossil.""""

This is what W & M actually say: 

""""The only way they [organic remains] can be preserved long enough from the usual processes of decay, scavenging and disintegration is by means of quick burial in aqueous sediments.""""

There is a big difference between an organism being saved from total destruction so that it might become a fossil and the fossilization processes of permineralization or carbonization, etc., which preserve the organism after it has been buried.  Talk.Origins conflates the two.  If you don't know the difference, you don't have enough knowledge to judge what W & M said and probably don't understand how Talk.Origins blatantly lied.

The above misrepresentation of W & M must be expunged from the article and a sentence reflecting what they actually say with a reliable source.  Talk.Origins has no reliability, as anyone can see, especially in this case.    """,0

If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.
Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will """"fail open"""" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network. Furthermore being a tree network a lot of traffic will tend to cluster on the center of the tree (the impact of this can be reduced by making those parts of the network higher speed or by using techniques like port trunking).""",0

 """"September 11 denial"""", whatever that may mean, has nothing to do with Mr Ahmadinejad! Please care to search on e.g. YouTube (see, let us say, this page) and notice that there are Americans who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing """"security reasons"""" as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever denied September 11 happening, however there are some who question the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film The Ziggurat Goddess (about which here), 2004, with Shahab Hosseini in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed.

Why not have both?  There is room. The Scientific Statement of Being is present. There is no conflict in having both.  There are 8 very sound sources that say the Tenets are the core beliefs.

Tenets of Christian Science
* 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life.
 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness.
 3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts.
 4. We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evi‐ dence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death.
 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to under‐ stand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter.
 6. And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. And to be merciful, just and pure.",0

Again, I feel obligated to remind people that things like countries or capital cities do not come into being solely upon declarations and recognitions. This is only one aspect, and not necessarily the most important. The fact that countries tell Israel: """"we don't like the fact that you maintain your capital in Jerusalem"""", or """"move your capital to Tel Aviv"""", does not make Jerusalem less of an Israeli capital from the factual point of view - it is still where you would find the Israeli center of government. Furthermore, it is incorrect to say that most countries recognized Jerusalem as a Palestinian occupied territory. The UK, for example, like many other countries, maintains that Jerusalem cannot be said to belong to any country for the time being. The EU recently published a vision in which Jerusalem is the capital of both Israel and a future Palestinian state. The PA itself recently published a plan (the """"Fayyad Plan"""") in which it explicitly stated that East Jerusalem (and not all of the city) should become the Palestinian capital.   """,0

 feedback as requested 

Hey Antonin! I'm only too happy to help out (as much as I can) - having sooooo many problems elsewhere. In fact, completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all. 

First impressions; not yet a balanced article - a lot on the controversies, too little on the magazine and its background; the latter, I think, needs clarification. What was the Czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? """"Conservative"""" is too vague - I think readers will benefit from being told more about Czech conservatism. Then there's the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group. 

Put it this way: certainly in the UK (and probably in the US), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn't something usually associated with a conservative magazine...  

I'll put this page on my watch-list. I'll be happy to sort out any copy issues, btw. Best regards,   

Thanks for your opinions, Davey. You are right, the article is not balanced. I'm trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, Reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still """"young"""" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on English Wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems. I'll work on it.   

I've attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended.   

Yes, I've been hovering over your shoulder the whole time! Good beefy stuff... d'you reckon you're pretty much done with the content? 'Cos I do, and intend twiddling up the prose some time this weekend. By the way, it's no big deal but are you OK with all those red-links?   

Hi Davey, you won't believe how happy I am seeing that you are still interested! I'm careful with the red links, this project has still gaps in detailed covering of Czech topics. All of the red linked names are notable Czech journalists. See the Czech wiki articles for Jan Šibík, Petr Hájek, Jiří X. Doležal, Tomáš Feřtek, Josef Klíma, Jiří Pehe, Tomáš Baldýnský, Bohumil Pečinka, Miloš Čermák, Pavlína Wolfová. With the red colour I'm trying to point out that they should have articles also here. Thank you for your help and interest, ask whatever )   

Oh, I know how that one feels. It can be a strange and lonely business indeed. Still, here come the queries:

 Constitution and Editorial continuity: d'you know who owned it in the first place? Was it a one-man show which employed Petr Hájek? Or was he owner and editor? Sorry to be picky here, but it'll matter, particularly as this is living persons biog.
 Yes, the BLP issue is the main reason why I asked for your help. Hájek was the owner, together with Andrej Šťastný and Jiří Fleyberk. He seems to be the most important one, according to my sources.
OK: so the sale of the magazine (over the heads of the editorial board) was entirely legal, despite the resentment. D'you think this was seen as a matter of personal gain and freedom of action (on his part) vs personal responsibility",0

This is something relatively new in wrestling, where WWE is using people like Brock, Taker, Rock, Sting, HHH, and Stephanie in spurts for feuds leading up to major shows, then they disappear/fade into the background for awhile, and then they come back for their next feud/match, and so on, and so on.

Lordkazan, I am currently looking for suitable citations. But still, I feel my original point was intentionally overlooked. You see, recently, I edited a German article concerning a Neonazi brand name (de:Consdaple). In that article, I inserted totally """"biased"""" ridiculing phrases, because I felt that in Germany, it is always better to decidedly distance yourself from Nazism (and because I am rather convinced of my eloquence in German, although I am certainly not as godlike at it as Avi is with English). Now, with the circumcision article, I have a similar dilemma. But my POV here is, although not more biased than with the Nazi topic, not the Public POV. And that's what I meant in the circumcision discussion: My POV is that there is no NPOV besides the instantaneous total rejection of neonatal genital mutilation, be it in Jewish tradition or whatever. And all that pointing to the respective guidelines by Avi or Jakew won't change that. But the article does not even feature the word """"intact"""", which in itself (the word and its rejection by the pro-biased lobby) is sufficient proof to me that they will never cease to bombard common sense. So alright, I'm Sancho Pansa, but do you really believe in playing the game like this? After all, Jakew doesn't have a problem with the Wikipedia guidelines, because his personal bias is similar to the American/community bias on the topic of circumcision.  """,0

mosque to house
I think that will be more accurate. it's a pilgrimage site therefore a shrine... the use of mosque in the ref is used not in accurate fashion.  

Pilgrimage site and worship site. It is more accurately a worshiping site and muslims come from all over the world to visit it as it is one of the 3 holiest sites. Maybe having it Mosque for worship is enough and fair along with the word shrine.  

house of pilgrimage. if not, it's best to leave it. almaqdisi, stop stalking.  

I do not undersand. Mginnly is saying that there are many sources which mention it is a Mosque. This is true. Now you are discussing it is for piligrimage or worship. Pointless. Keep the word a Mosque only if pilgrimage will be an issue of debate too! No need to mention piligrimage or worship, just a mosque. And accroding  to the definition of a Mosque, it is a place of worship. In Mecca the piligrims go to worship in a Mosque called masjid al-Haram. But again, if this is an issue of debate, forget it and just keep the word Mosque along with the word shrine. Simple...  
it's by definition not a mosque. some refer to it as mosque because of pilgrimage. No, the article will never say in the lead that it's a """"mosque"""" because it isn't. Live with it.  

Alternate version will be to leave """"shrine"""" and in the end of the lead say something like """"Some refer to the Dome as a Rock as a mosque even though it isn't"""". That can be acceptable too.  

Amuros, please let us not repeat the stuff we did in several talk pages...! Any one can go to Google and find """"Dome of the Rock Mosque"""" or """"Mosque of Umar"""" to see that this is indeed a Mosque.! I will stop discussing this any further.

I'm obviously going to stay out of the content arguments so as to remain neutral.  However I did want to say that it is pleasing to see the different sides here working collaboratively towards a compromise.  It seems there has already been agreement from the main parties that a section is justified even if significantly shorter than before which seems to be a huge improvement from the time of the RfC.  This back and forth with concrete proposals and commenting only on the issue at hand rather than the editors themselves is the way forward and probably has the best chance of reaching a compromise.  If a compromise can't be reached then at least there should be better defined questions for an RfC.  If it is felt necessary to start another RfC to break a deadlock can I suggest that interested parties try to reach agreement on the RfC statement before posting it as this will be more likely to lead to a solution that everyone accepts even if it's not the one they desire.  I'd like to suggest that editors refrain from commenting on other editors and accept that they have different views.  If a compromise can't be reached on an issue I would suggest that the way forward may best be for the sides to admit this before temperatures get too hot and to leave that question for a later RfC once a full list of disagreements had been reached.  I'm in no way dictating this way forward and if the parties agree to a different way forward that will likely be better still.  I'm just trying to suggest ways to avoid what happened before.,0

"Link to UST Global leadership team 

Dear EdJohnston,

 Please find UST Global leadership team in the link http://www.ust-global.com/leadership.aspx
Do you really want to have external links that have outdated/wrong info about an article in Wikipedia? Wiki is an Encyclopedia which is most popular in the world and widely used for collecting accurate information about anything under the sun. Anyway Business Week has updated the content to the actual facts about the leadership team of UST Global. FYI the link to the same http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4298931. I think now you might have understood why I was removing this link before.

 Can I ask you to check few pages in Wikipedia itself regarding UST Global content and find what i am trying to say here? This is very important. Could you please check the link http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UST_Global&limit;=500&action;=history.

This link takes you to the earliest revision history page of UST Global. Please find when this page was initially drafted and when did the user Steve Ross started editing the page. This wikipedia page was started in 2005 and Steve came in to picture by 2007. The most interesting thing here you can find is the first few edits by Steve Ross. He added himself as co-founder of UST where right now he wants to mention himself as founder of the company. Don’t you find that this user is inconsistent with his edits and this proves that his intention is to advertise himslef? Also could you please check whether this user has contributed anything else in this Wiki page other than adding his name in different roles of UST Global?

All you want to know about UST Global is available in their website (www.ust-global.com).
Also I want to repeat here that I am not here to violate any rules or policies of Wikipedia. I just want to point out the anomalies in this Wiki page. Could you please listen to my request. This is genuine.",0

"Mr Dahn, I would be only too happy to deal only with facts. 
-TABSaving 300 000 lives against the odds, the pressure and the sheer logic, if one is criminally antisemitic through and through, is a fact sir. 
-TABDismantling the Iron Guard, a declared antisemitic and pro-german organization, is another paradox
-TABMarying a Jewish lady as an antisemit, doesn’t make sense
-TABAllowing the Jewish community to have official representatives, to befriend at least one of them, the lider of that community and to lend him an attentive ear and to let him convince you to change some of the previously issued orders and laws, does not, again, fit into an antisemitic profile. 
-TABAllowing some of the deported Jews in Transnistria to be repatriated, is not, again, an act of an atisemite. (It is another unprecedented act; can you quote one single similar occurrence in an Europe under the german boot?)

Please explain this. My request is NOT rethorical. I do agree on your superior erudition in the matter, for all I know, you might be a historian, whereas I am just interested in history. And PLEASE don’t refer me to other books, reports, authors. Just give me your own opinion on the points above. Not your opinion that they do not matter, but how do you explain them? I accept your patronizing unpleasant as it may be, if you’ll just explain. 

And try to see my point: I DO accept the possibility of being wrong. I try to stay as objective as I can, but till now, I heard rather unilateral accusations, rather than specific proofs and facts. That’s the diference between us, when confronted with discrepancies, you sir seem to deliberately ignore them, because the authors you read do so; me, I start my own research. I have spoken personally to at least 50 people, who lived through those terrible times, not Jewish, unfortunately, but certainly not antisemitic. (It’s not much, but at least I did it; what’s YOUR personal research ?) They are spread over all major Romanian regions, my witnesses, covering many different trades. Not one, mind you, ever heard, much less witnessed, any antisemitic violence ORDERED BY ANTONESCU or his government on Romania – old territory. Please quote contrary evidence, first hand if possible. I confess, I couldn’t find Jewish witnesses, all my Jewish friends and aquaintances are too young for that, but I’m still looking. 

And excuse me, the accusation of “incomplete quoting” the Wiesel repport is ludicrous. Would you want me to quote the full text ? My point was that even in a report that I consider unilateral and biased (like a trial with prosecutors only and without defenders), important facts like apparently inexplicable acts of mercy and a definite orriginal Jewish policy, totally opposed to that of Germany, at a time when Germany was still all powerfull, could not be remained unnoticed. The Wiesel Commission itself, sir, could not ignore those facts; how can you ? 

The Wiesel Report allowed such colossal mistakes as blaming a whole state, a whole nation, I remember of having read the phrase “the crimes committed by Antonescu and the Romanian nation against Jews”. You never blame a whole nation, a whole population. 

 The blame sir, is INDIVIDUAL, as Frederic Forsythe says. And so is the salvation. 

An intelligent man knows that when you deal with great numbers, you have to apply statistics, over-generalization is one of the  most unforgivable acts. And such a phrase lies in the same report in which there are mentioned pro-Jewish acts, both from government level and from individuals, only to underline that they don’t count. And you want me to take such a report as gospel truth, a model of impartiality and justice ?

MR MIRCION, kindly, get a grip on yourself. To state that Antonescu is “my hero” proves you didn’t even tried to read what I wrote; if so, how and what are you criticizing ? 

I repeat, to be sure Antonescu was involved in war crimes. Commited in war zones. He was not involved in crimes against humanity, in cold-blood premeditated murder, based on an ethnic cleansing policy, on the contrary, he tried, and partially succeeded to stop it, against considerable political pressure and certainly against the major antisemitic trend in a Germany dominated Europe. He is to be condemned, of course, but NOT for the wrong reasons. At the time of the reckoning, both good and bad deeds should be put in the balance. Romanians, sir, have the right to criticize, accuse, and condemn Antonescu. Not the Jewish people from Romania-old kingdom, since Antonescu saved 300 000 of them while sending almost half a million of his own people to their death. 

To be sure, this is just my opinion, but it’s based on facts.

 If you have explanations for the points lined up in the answer above to Mr Dahn’s reply, based on facts, not on second-h",0

 User_talk:Stpaul#Personal attacks 

I find it absolutely hypocritical that you percieve the French contribution to England as one of oppression and nothing else, whilst including the Irish whom would object to England in respect to the same percieved issue.  You have insulted the Irish by not affording them the same position you afford yourself as regards the French.  You wholly capitalise on your own fantasies and call anybody else's neutrality to be POV-pushing.  You do not believe in seeing that others have equality with your standing, but sure get upset when it is not percieved to have been given you by others.  Oh how democratic and enlightened such attitudes are.  You'd make a """"fine"""" diplomat!  Governmental practices of power delegation vs restriction means nothing in respect to ethnic relations; they exist irrelevantly.  Therefore, your arguments are jingoistic and POV supremacism.   

I am simply supporting the consensus, which is to only include nations of the British Isles. As a matter of fact, I think the Germans are a lot closer to us than the French, but someone else has been trying to argue the opposite and at the same time push all sorts of medievalist, aristocratic fantasies.

You rewrite history to serve your Whig history-revisionist political schemes!  I have no aristocratic fantasies, unlike yourself!

You hate the Mediaeval example, but are ardent defender of the New World Order in saying one thing and doing another!  You rewrite history to commit hypocrisy; condemning the actions of one party towards your percieved polity and then adopting such policies towards other ethnic peoples.

So it would seem that someone who cannot read is busy worrying about the counting ability of another.And this issue was discussed last year, the time to respond was then, at that time you were also asked direct questions by me, which you chose to ignore.
And that an arbcom member is so bent of fighting with a mere editor and besmirching him  must be also a source of great pride for some. I have not commented on your religion or your country, you have on mine. Shows who has  attacked people based on national identities or religion. So that too must make someone very proud.
 Defending a person, or standing up for them does not mean one agrees with every statement that they may have made. Show me where I have defended Bhaisaab's anti religion comments. So you have now made another false claim above that I defend anti semetic speech. By the same generalisation what would you say about an admin not even reacting to an virulent anti Muslim speech made by his protege, even after I posted it on the admin's talk page ? Further that admin's  defending his protege then makes the admin  (by your logic above) a defender of anti Muslim speech!. That  I an editor with no powers is fighting a biased and prejudiced person, misusing his position , is a great source of pride for me.
 Also please do note that since the arbcom elections I have not bothered to be involved with you, till you went about posting details about me;and your attempt to trace my location , to an editor hostile to me.

 Msa Garratts 

Hi,

The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. 

The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first """"main line"""" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.

The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.

The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"""" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.

So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.

Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.

Please feel free to use the above if you wish.

Cheers,

Michael.""",0

 classical optics part 2 

i hate to say this but i think everyone has completely misunderstood what i am tryint to do.

i am just trying to give a clear picture to the reader of the beginings and then move on to the other sections, i have no intention at all of changing the structure of the article. the article begins very clearly with the """"classical optics"""" part that describes how light was considered before the wave model. the problem our current presentation is that the wave model is right in the begining, this is a bit strange.

that is why i arranged the article such that you had the classical optics and its further explanation in geometrical optics, then wave modeln then comparison to quantum optics and finally modern optics. in other words nothing in the article changed except for the position.
copper i feel that in the sources you have shown they are considering classical optics as the entire thing which is both the particle and wave model. however what i am doing is showing the beginning of optics. there are other google hits that take classical optics purely as the earlier concepts before the introduction of wave model but anyway there is no point of going through them and listing them. one google book on fourier optics does not mention the word """"electromagnetism"""" till page 365! different terminology i guess. anyway 

i feel that we cant put the wave model in the beginning, it just would not make any sense. its like we are skipping everything and landing on maxwells equations which happened much later. the current form is ok. 

it follows a good pattern - classical, geometrical, wave model, comparison with quantum optics finally modern optics.""",0

Oh really? Tell me, Dab, are you an atheist? You have to answer this question. How can you say that “It really shouldn't matter”? It matters! If you are a theist, you will try to say something negative about atheism. You will try to collect useless criticism of atheism from pro-religious websites.

Look, most theists don’t understand atheism properly. They have little knowledge about science and if they were to understand the meaning of reason and science, they will become atheists. Most theists cannot make a distinction between Intelligent Design and Evolution. They fail to understand why Intelligent Design is a pseudoscience and Evolution is a valid science. 

This is your opinion:

There can be no doubt that Lewis was an intelligent man. He has published on his views of theism.

Your views don’t seem to have a neutral point of view. You recommended me to study about C. S. Lewis. Is that neutral? C.S. Lewis was a Christian apologetics. And, I think his views were silly. C. S.

According to your logic, reverting vandalism would be disruptive too, and should lead to blocking.  I think the problem here is that, like many admins, you barely contribute to Wikipedia, and care little about its content.  You are mainly a janitor and policeman, and tend to develop a janitor's and a policeman's attitude.  It is an issue of systemic bias.  Ordinary users tend to have an editor's attitude, i.e. their priority is making articles as good as possible, and not accept other people's bad edits.

Oh, I do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length (look at this for example), but I am under no illusions that people like you or Eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument.  At the end of the day, the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content.  This is my observation after long examination of Wikipedia.

In the specific case of me versus Eiorgio, your mention of discussion is also a straw man because you are trying to imply that I only discussed in the edit summaries.

 'Comparing white Americans to Norwegians in his 1995 book, """"The Tyranny of Numbers,"""" [ Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington concluded that """"white America's higher rates of infant mortality are explained not by poverty (as conventionally construed) or by medical care but rather by the habits, actions and indeed lifestyles of a critical portion of its parents."""" Whites are not unique in those types of behavior. 

 'African-American babies are far more likely to die than white ones, which is often taken as evidence that poverty and lack of health insurance are to blame. That's entirely plausible until you notice another racial/ethnic gap: Hispanics of Mexican or Central or South American ancestry not only do consistently better than blacks on infant mortality, they do better than whites. Social disadvantage doesn't explain very much. Nor does access to prenatal care, as the health care critique implies. It used to be assumed that if you assured that pregnant low-income women could see a physician, their infants would do much better. Not necessarily.'

 Questions about a certain [reversion] edit   

I have some questions about this edit. 

I did not remove the character string that [supposedly] is the title.  That is, the string that is the title according to the """"edit comment"""" which says: """"um, no, the title is the line above that"""".] 

On the other hand, this edit (see above) did remove the character string that (IMHO) was a better title.  (That is, the string that I thought was better, as [all or part of] a """"title"""" for the web page with the URL of http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=128944 .) 

I am not immediately ready to """"insist"""" that leaving in both of those two character strings is the best choice.  (However, if you have any comments about that """"idea"""", I am willing to listen.)  

I am prepared to try to reach some consensus.  Is there anything we can do to explore (or discuss) (or, explain to each other) the goals that are [perhaps] to be achieved by choosing well, [and carefully] which character string to use as the """"title""""?   (or, maybe that should say, << the goals that are """"more nearly"""" to be achieved >> by doing so) (- ? -). 

Would it benefit anyone (perhaps in pursuing the above mentioned goals?) if one of us were to explore (or discuss) (or, explain) the reasons why the use of the character stringSabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 for the """"title"""", would be better? 

Do we both understand (thoroughly and well) what each word of that """"title"""" means, and what its role is, in doing whatever things a title is supposed to be helpful for?  (such as, describing the """"topic"""" of a certain web page, and informing the reader a little bit, what a certain web page is """"about"""" - ? - ) 

Do we both (or, do any of us) think that this """"title""""Sabal Adanson ex Guersent, Bulletin des Sciences, par la Societe Philomatique. 87: 205-206. 1804 comes closer to describing the """"topic"""" of the web page, or otherwise (in some sense) doing thoroughly and well those things that a title is [/slash, """"should"""" be] helpful for? 

Have both of us [sufficiently] considered the question of what the web page with the URL of (value of the """"url"""" field) is about?  IMHO, it comes pretty close to being about """"Palmetto"""".  I could be wrong... 

I hope this does not sound [too] negative.  I hope that there is still a chance that one of us can wake up and learn something, that is not already known (at least, something that we don't both already know).  So, maybe there is hope for a happy, win-win outcome, that will be the best for all concerned.  (It would even be fine with me, if [after reaching some consensus successfully] we were to nuke this whole section, if [e.g.] we both wanted to delete it before it got in to any """"archive"""" files.) """"No harm / no foul.""""  (getting in to """"history"""" logs,  or, """"remaining"""" in them  might be a different matter.) 

You are welcome (btw) to answer some questions that I did not [know to] ask.  (""""if any"""").

I am not the founder, I am a contributor citing the founder's definition which I was able to find online, as the most appropriate definition of what the organization is. 

What you are suggesting is absurd. You are saying that it is not appropriate to inquire what the group is about directly from the creator instead relying on the opinion of someone else who clearly is opposed to what the group represents. 

Lets look at this from a more personal view. Do either of these argument examples seem resonable when applied to other topics?

Example 1. You are Jewish and tried to argue that; in a Wiki entry about """"Nazisim Beginnings"""", Hitlers definition of how the Nazi party got (perhaps extracted verbatim from Mein Kampf, would be less relevant than say Alan Dershowitz's thoughts on the topic extracted from an Op-Ed peice in the Times, because in your view, Hitler's definition seemed to one-sided and preachy.

Example 2. I am black and tried to argue that Louis Farrakhan would more neutrally write the """"Overview"""" entry for the """"Leakey Foundation"""" than the groups namesake Louis Leakey. The reason I give for this choice is that """"to use Leakey's comments on the subject, no matter how precise his summary, could only be a """"soapbox"""" for his opinion and agenda.

Does either example seem reasonable to you if you can access the source and get an unadulterated definition?

The entry I am including is very thorough, and includes highly important information such as founding members, date of origination, what they believe, what they don't believe, and anything someone researching the group would want to find out. You have a userbox for """"This user is opposed to online censorship."""" but that is clearly your intent here as you are simply removing relevant information under the thin argument of """"saving the world from a soapbox"""".

Here's a few points for you to think on.

WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.
Then let's consider the ArbCom an article. What then is this articles content?
Hmm, let's see … the ArbCom is an article, so what is the ArbCom made of? Why, members. So that means the content of the committee is it's members. So an election is a decision on the content of this article.
So.
Members are editors, so content is editors, so in order to write this article we must discuss the content.
We must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content.
You don't like that?
WP:Civil, WP:AGF & WP:NPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles.
But ArbCom is not an article. It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee.
We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee.
We cannot question articles about their content, nor can we ask the content questions, but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions.
Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership? If you do not think so, how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid? Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance. There was no name calling, all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom. They were not deferential. Which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed.

 UFC AFDs 
Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.   
I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been """"officially"""" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.    

 Jake Bostwick 
I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   
At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    

Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. 

Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. 

Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.

I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.

Since you filed the SPI, I wanted to update you that I've reversed the block.  I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.  I completely see why you reported it (I did block, after all), so there is no question as to your faith here.  Just wanted to update you.  - 2¢  ©  Join WER

 No offense taken, but I see no need to moderate my tone.

Nowhere did I mention her fans.  If it is a courtesy to anyone, it is to bell hooks herself, out of respect for her personal statement.  And the issue at hand here is why we SHOULD move it, as that is the proposal, and many reasons have been given.  It is not necessary to prove that she """"does not want her name to be capitalized"""".  

Or are you trying to say that such a finding would supersede all other arguments and be grounds upon which to make the move?  If so, then you are being contrary and absurd.  My burden, and those who support the move, was to provide reasons for the move, and it is then up to the opposition to cite reasons against it, which they have not done.  Some have even changed their vote from oppose to support.  Even , for all of his wordiness, seems to be in support of the move, but is just playing his role as administrator, and being cautious before he commits to the move.  I'd say overly so, but that is my opinion.  Even if the lack of """"proof"""" you're looking for was the only reason against the move, the overwhelming reasons for the move supersede it.  You really have no case, but alas - and thankfully - it is not up to you. —''''''T C W """,0
"Thanks 

Greetings Mikhailov, Thanks for the welcome and your generous suggestions! I particularly like the four waves and will incorporate that in my modus operandi. I wish I had more time to edit, although that is not my calling, yet I'd love to help. Here I am just trying to keep my two Cuba books (I'm the author) in the further reading sections... Yes, another self serving bastard. For me it is difficult to stay on top of this alone. I do have several questions that you certainly could answer, yet if you will is another matter entirely. 

1) When there is no further reading section, should I A) create one or B) add the information in the reference section (I feel that may be a faux pas)or C) do something else like ... run Forrest run? 
 
2) Unfortunately I have not had anyone write a bio for me... yet. I'm afraid I am responding at a poor time because while I usually dominate Google searches with my books, interviews, and my Blog at Sulekha, at the moment I am a distant second on the first page. Sadly, I share the name of Charles Spencer King with the inventor of the Range Rover.... This confuses many a seeker as you might imagine. Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).

    I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct? 

 3) For some reason my ISBN does not seem to work here despite the fact I am on everything from Amazon through the Library Thing....and everything between. Odd, yet I would be delighted if at the very least I could get this to go to either the individual page at Amazon or the title page ( this one:)    http://www.amazon.com/Charles-Spencer-King/e/B002ELIWKI/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1

Once one goes beyond the level of, say, The National Enquirer, the issue is not whether the source is reliable for any particular fact so much as whether the source is overweighting material that tends to attract more mass market interest.  Wikipedia was not created in order to just attract eyeballs.  The problem with, say, The Fox Nation, and The Huffington Post, in other words, is not that they lean right or left, respectively, but that they have a populist lean such that some discretion is in order.  For whatever reason, there is a lot more editor interest in adding (often without context), say, what O'Donnell said about mice with human brains on TV than there is interest in adding what a more """"boring"""" politician like Mitch Daniels said to The Economist.  And there is undoubtedly more reader interest in O'Donnell than in Daniels as well.  But our obligation here is to be encyclopedic.  The Encyclopedia Britannica is often found in academic libraries where it is read by stuffy people who are more interested in an informative read than an entertaining one.   Beyond this, one has to ask how many quotes of this sort even Fox News or HuffPo would have if they were to have a single story on O'Donnell, which is what we are constructing here.  All this to say that an edit that introduced this quote would be considerably more likely to have a consensus supporting its inclusion if it replaced some other controversial, widely criticized or ridiculed remark by the article subject as opposed to adding to them.

2. The statement “This view was put forward by the second president of the Watchtower Joseph Franklin Rutherford” not only lacks verification, it is just plain false. Rutherford did not teach that blood per se was sacred, and he never condemned blood transfusion. 

3. The statement “Beginning in 1980, the medical use of certain products derived from blood became permissible” is not verified, and it is just plain false. Watchtower doctrine tolerated some products derived from blood as early as November of 1961, which was only ten months after blood transfusion became a shunning offence. 

4. The statement “there is evidence that some Jehovah's Witnesses have secretly taken medical products derived from blood or blood transfusions” is a patent misrepresentation. Verifiable source material demonstrates that some Jehovah’s Witnesses have also openly accepted blood transfusion! 

5. The statement, “The non-acceptance of blood products by groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses has caused many hospitals to offer bloodless medicine” is another horrible misconstruction.

Discography
We should be able to come up with a definitive list of commercially released albums and singles. Let's start with the headings. 

Officially Released
Self Released
Singles
Out of Print Compilations
In Print Compilations

Those should be in sentence case. Do folks agree on those headings? - 

 I think those sound reasonable. I have changed them to sentence case, and re-added the record covers which were deleted from the discography by Jonah. I also re added the descriptions of Rose's musical style that were deleted without explanation. Finally I re-incorporated a new version of the sentence dealing with racism and antisemitism. It makes not direct claims about Rose's online work, only that it deals with race and religion. Then I wrote that this has created a series of accusations of racism and antisemitism in various online chat groups. While online chat groups are not officially a source, the fact remains that these criticisms are out there, posted in various places. I think that this should satisfy both SP (by being NPOV) and Ayers (by bringing up the issue).  Hope this helps. I agree with Will, let's move on.  

I do wonder at the designations of """"self-released"""" vs. """"officially released."""" At what point does one become the other? """"Bone Again"""" and """"Elizabethan Period"""" were funded by people or companies other than Biff, and given professional print runs of a few to several thousand; they were distributed through non-internet indie channels, and reviewed in Mojo magazine.  """"Roast Beef"""" was pressed using Biff's royalties, but then it was picked up by a distributor who slapped their own record label's sticker on the cover; several thousand were produced and sold.  """"Hamburger Blues"""" was an """"official"""" release that may have been a smaller print run than some of Biff's website releases.  """"Uncle Jesus"""" was a major label album that is harder to find than """"Roast Beef."""" """"The Pickwick album was an """"offical"""" compilation of far seedier origin than some of the indie releases.  The whole issue of """"in print"""" vs. """"out of print"""" is a bit difficult to assess as well.  If copies are sealed, stockpiled and available, isn't the album still """"in print""""?

My concern with these categories is that they tend to appear at the same times that text changes are made diminishing Biff's accomplishments; and they seem to be included as part of the intent of that effort.  If you look at other artists' discographies, these distinctions are rarely made.  For example, see Sun_Ra.  A great many of Sun Ra's albums were self-released, including most of the artistic milestones.  It is a vague and misleading designation.  Why not go for straight chronology?

And to confirm Marcuse's interpretation, I was not implying that Marcuse initiated a given edit.  Is someone trying to start fights where they ain't?   

The problem here is that you wrote something, a line that went unsingned, but on closer inspection was found to be added by you but attributed by you to someone esle. You then followed this by saying that you agreed with the line. Very unwiki of you.

Indeed, someone is trying to start fights where they ain't.   

 Wallawe/Jonah, I'm curious what the """"released on cdr"""" that you keep adding to the discography means? What is cdr? As far as the self vs. officially why don't we just simply put """"Full length releases"""" and combine them?  

In most of these cases """"cdr"""" is not an accurate designation.  Some of them were glass-mastered CDs.  But as I said above, I don't think that's too important, anyway.  

, you claimed to revert back to Marcuse, but you did not.  That's a super-misleading tag.  

And now I understand what you are referring to:  .  That's something I do a lot.  It's called """"Paragraphs.""""  Here, I'll do one right now.  Here goes....

"Irving quote 

Re: Authoritive statements of Irving in [Battle of Britain] article.

You have re-wrote the section as following:

Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels, with 250 single-engined and 64 twin-engined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974, p. 163., and that as a result, the number of German front line aircraft were declining, and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942, with a huge effort to expand production, reaching 1,200 by March/April 1942.Irving 1974, p. 142.

In fact, however, Irving does not make these statements. If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:
On Milch’s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged  single- and  twin-engined aircraft a month during . Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers, and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well.⁴⁰

etc.

Ie. Irving does not state 'totally inadequate production levels' (and even less, mentions bombers), this is the addition of one editor to the Irving book, which has been described as 'Milchs diary' (which is it not, either)",0

= More a fault of interpretation  

Mr Shyamal, 

In your answer, one notices very well that you still made an error, because you fix yourselves on the imaginary scientific value of Rognes or of the americains, by hating the objective value of the other authors and in particular of Lehrer.  To better explain you the taxonomic situation of the kind Bengalia s. str., I request from you do not consider that I insult certain characters of current taxonomy and to see reality exactly exposed by me. 

No author who occupied himself more or less tangentially with Bengaliidae, admits that Bengalia testacea  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  Only Rognes, which copied Sabrosky (1999:62), which knew this group of dipterous in same measurement as Rognes, wrote (with the collaboration of bibliographical and nonscientific impostors:  Neal L Evenhuis and F.C. Thompson) that this type is the nomen nudum  B. testacea  indicated by Duponchel (1842)(?!).  Thus, which makes N.L Evenhuis, J. E. O' Hara, T. Pape and A. C. Pont are only of copy and to transcribe exactly the silly things of Sabrosky, without any proof or analyze scientific.  Moreover, because these authors are good friends with Rognes, it also added """" Valid genus [ tests  Rognes (2006:467) ] """", but not validates species-type.  But, can you say which tests was made by Rognes?,  who knows nothing on Bengaliidae, which made the most stupid silly things in its work, which does not know the morphological terminology of their genitalia male, which mixes the drawings of the authors for the different species to make its new taxa, which makes the photography of the microscopic preparations of the species studied by Lehrer and deposited in the Natural history museum of London and which affirms that those are clean taxonomic imaginations?  Don't you believe my assertions?  Then I recommend to you to read, for a good documentation of your encyclopaedia, work of Lehrer of his review Fragmenta Dipterologica:  2008(18):1-4;  2010(23):1-22 and 22-25; 2010(24):20-24 and 24-30;  2010(25):1-4 and work:  LEHRER & WEI, 2010, a new Eastern kind of the family Bengaliidae (Diptera) - Bull. Ploughshare ent.  Mulhouse, 66(2)21-25.  
Thus you can understand that Rognes is incomparable being unaware of, which wanted to make taxonomic """" revolutions """" with the language devoted to its handicapped pupils of the school of Stavanger (Norway) where it works and with the mystifications of literature and information.  Moreover, you can consider only the work of Evenhuis &Comp.;  of Zootaxa an authority in the taxonomy of Bengaliidae constitutes, because they never studied the species of the group and in particular ?, because all the authors, of Zumpt (1956) and until Lehrer (2010) consider that Bengalia labiata  R.D. is the species-type of the Bengalia kind.  If you want to mislead the readers, you are free to depreciate your Wikipedia.

"""

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if """"A"""" were a dead body and """"B"""" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, """"A"""", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed """"B"""". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

""":::::LOL, I just have to reply to Danny Muse's reply to Elenap. It's not nice, but I have to speak. When will you get it Danny? Propaganda and logical fallacies are not a reasonable method of influencing people, especially if you are claiming to represent God and be a Christian, so why do you continue with them and your specious reasoning? All the points in your reply can easily be refuted. You said above: """"If text in one place is inappropriate or excessive . . ."""" You have totally failed to prove the premise of your argument, but you then presumptuously assume that everyone will just blindly accept your wanted opinions as facts, and so you come out with a straw man argument about """"inappropriate and excessive"""". You get the medal for surreptitious false reasoning. You then go on with another blatantly false statement: """"And as far as this section being POV, its title, """"Books Critical of the Group"""" proves that it is by definition a POV section."""" Danny, how exactly is something that is 'critical' proof that it is biased or POV? You have failed totally to make even the most basic case for your assumed conclusions; you just jump there with one giant false leap. Criticism is not by default proof of a bias, POV, or non-objectivity as you incorrectly assume. For example, if you said """"five plus five is thirteen"""", someone could objectively and neutrally criticise your ability at maths, and your conclusion, and prove you wrong, without having any biased point of view, or dubious agenda. Facts can be proven false or true, that is the rational basis of objective reasoning. Merely being critical is not a valid cause for rejection of the one criticising, as you manipulatively try and twist into its meaning with more ad hominem. You also ignore the hypocrisy of your argument, as Jehovah's Witnesses have masses of material heavily criticising other religions, so by your default, it should all be rejected as POV, biased, and highly subjective, and of little of no value. You have shot yourself in the foot Danny. You then go on with paragraphs of irrelevant red herrings, straw men, and more ad hominem character assassinations, in true Watch Tower fashion. You should read these Watch Tower articles on criticism and open-mindedness. 

You come out with even more logical fallacies, by mentioning subjects that do not apply, and hoping the less knowledgeable reader will fall for your 'guilt by association' machinations. You speak about """"disaffected individuals, apostates, and anti-cult movements"""", as if this somehow applies to Franz, when you have proven nothing. I'm sure I could get a host of quotes telling us all how sick and degenerate paedophiles are, and link that to you, and plenty of people would fall for that one if said over and over enough times, and the trick would have worked, no one would listen to anything you have to say if they believed you were messing about with little children. Your corrupt use of negative propaganda is disgusting, especially as you claim to be a Christian. I suggest you read your religion's articles on propaganda, you might learn to be more objective and less scheming in your arguments.

You then say: """"Especially suspect are """"Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain"""" by publishing books, etc."""" LOL, I nearly fell on the floor with laughter with that one! Hey, Danny, look in the mirror! The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society makes nearly a '$$$Billion$$$ US Dollars a year, a large part coming from its massive literature sales, most to loyal JWs. They also dodge paying their taxes on that massive income, this depleting the local community of needed funds (except in France where they have to pay their taxes, and are calling on """"Satan's European governments"""" to fight Jehovah's scriptural worldly tax arrangements, LOL). The greed of the publishing Watch Tower is terrible, but interestingly not a peep of condemnation from Danny about those Watch Tower """"Especially suspect 'Individuals who take up a cause for personal gain' by publishing books"""". Pure gold from Danny Muse!

You then go on: """"There are not similar books listed on the WP pages for the Catholic religion. . ."""" Since when did JWs love to link themselves with Catholics? Besides Catholics being a specially hated religion by Jehovah's Witnesses, it is completely different in its size, history and doctrines, and its treatment if those who criticise it. There are over 1 billion Catholics, and a 1500 year old religion, with massive tradition etc., why on earth would it be described the same as a 120 year old cult like prophecy obsessed group that treats its internal critics like demon possessed monsters, and then expels them and bans its members from",0

I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, """"In Cold Blood"""", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.

The inclusion of 'high-accuracy' was a reluctant compromise, following the suggestion by Paine for 'fair-accuracy'. My approach is to remove calculus entirely from mention, given that there is no supporting evidence that it does anything remotely close to solving the paradoxes  when considering the infinite orders of magnitudes below the Planck length, that calculus spans, but which cannot be proved via experimental evidence as being at all relevant.

 Quebec registration plates prohibited in front? 

But... why? What bad would it do to put another plate in front? I don't understand.   
That is a question to ask the Québec government for their specific reasoning on that. I know for a fact safety is one reason some jurisdictions give. Example: A front plate might look """"real"""" and be confused for a real plate in other jurisdictions that have a front plate, you can take your pick - i'm just hypothesizing why. I do know that some vehicles in Québec, Semis (tractor trailers) are required to have a front plate, as the trailer hides the plate on the back of a Truck (tractor), for example. Like I said, just because it's not legal, it does not mean police enforce it, and just because it hasn't been enforced by some police does not mean it will not be by others.  """,0
"Parentacide 

Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.

Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.

In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.

Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0

My conflict is with the unjustified elevation to """"facthood"""" of unverified theories and speculations extracted from the elements of the controversy.  Nor am I concerned about my anonymity.  It is trivially easy to look me up, and I presume that most interested parties here by now know my real name, credentials, and affiliations.  I have used the screen name """"Moulton"""" since 1990, when I began developing science education resources on the Internet as a member of an educational technology research group funded by the National Science Foundation.  The articles I co-authored with Professor Picard were also funded by a grant from the NSF.  My allegiance is to the cause of science and science education, and that is the role I propose to play here.

To keep the peace, I will propose below the insertion of an intervening section between the biographical material and the disputatious """"Darwin Dissent Controversy"""" that some editors here wish to retain on this page with appalling disregard for the ground truth.  

My concern is that some of the existing material is based on unwarranted assumptions regarding people whose names appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition.  My concern is that the unwarranted assumptions constitute a potentially libelous violation of the WP:BLP """"Do No Harm"""" clause by propagating dubious claims of the DI as if they were established facts.  Elsewhere I have managed to highlight the passages where Wikipedia articles have blithely adopted the DI's view of the controversial petition without first examining the evidence for their dubious view with a sufficiently keen and skeptical eye.

Please bear with me and extend to me the courtesy of patience and good faith, as I am not conversant with all the Wikipedia conventions regarding resolution of disputatious content appearing on the biographies of living persons.  Please understand that I am here to work for the betterment of Wikipedia, in the name of science, science education, and science journalism.

"My preference: to show how the equation of motion is derived 

I copy and paste from above:

What is represented in the animation that gives the straight-above view is that the overall rotation affects the vibration; the dynamics falls in the category of coupled oscillators. 
 True, the pendulum is not free, the Coriolis effect varies during the motion even if the rotational speed of the Earth is constant.   

In , I present that the Foucault pendulum precession and its sine law are readily understood in terms of coupling of oscillators.  | Talk 

There is a difference of approach between my sandbox article and the english and french wikipedia articles (I intend to integrate the material in my sandbox article into the english wikipedia article.)

I believe that an encyclopedic article that features a mathematical treatment should focus on the derivation. In the material that I have prepared the mathematical treatment starts with first principles, and subsequently works its way towards the equation of motion:

Once the equation of motion is formulated the physics has been taken care of, and I proceed no further.

I find the treatment in the current english wikipedia article and in the current french wikipedia article unsatisfactory in the following way: the mathematical treatment merely states the equation of motion; the physics taking place (coupling of oscillations) is not discussed.  | Talk",0

Converses, they are amazing. if you are """"gangsta"""" they do wonders for you <3

When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. Widely popular during the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted a distinctly American image with its Converse Yearbook. Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse's role in the lives of high school and college athletes.
Converse Jack Purcells

Through its shoes, Converse developed into an iconic brand, and came to be seen as the essential sports shoe. In the 1970s, Converse purchased the trademark rights to Jack Purcell sneakers from B.F. Goodrich.[2]

Converse lost much of its apparent near-monopoly from the 1970s onward, with the surge of new competitors, including Puma and Adidas, then Nike, Inc.Nike, then a decade later Reebok, who introduced radical new designs to the market. Converse found themselves no longer the official shoe of the National Basketball Association, a title they had relished for many years. While being employed at Converse, one of its employees, Jim Labadini (1968-78), created the chevron and star insignia / logo that still remains on most Converse footwear items that are not classic Chuck Taylors.

The loss of market share, combined with poor business decisions, forced Converse to file for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Mardsen Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David Maddocks to lead the turnaround of America's Original Sports Company.

The new team drove Converse from the 16th largest footwear company to number 7 in less than 2 1/2 years, leading to a buyout by rival Nike on July 9, 2003 for $305 million, qualifying as the merger and acquisition of the year in 2003.[3]

Current NBA players wearing Converse include Kyle Korver, Maurice Evans, Udonis Haslem, Elton Brand, Louis Williams, Larry Sanders, Luke Harangody, and Chris Andersen. """"Big Baby"""" Glen Davis wore Converse mainly for away games for 2011-2012 while also wearing Nike for some home games. JJ Barea and Kirk Hinrich were former long-time endorsers who switched to Nike during the course of the 2011-2012 season.
Converse skateboarding

Converse launched its skateboarding program in 2009 with a team of """"ambassadors"""": Anthony Pappalardo, Nick Trapasso, Sammy Baca, Ethan Fowler, Raymond Molina, and Rune Glifberg.[4]

In 2012, the company added Jason Jessee and Mike Anderson to its ambassadors team.[5]

Red Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe
For more details on this topic, see Chuck Taylor All Star.

The Chuck Taylor All Star shoe has developed a number of nicknames over the years, such as: """"Cons"""", """"Connies"""", """"Convics"""", """"Convos"""", """"Verses"""", """"Chuckers"""", """"Chucks"""", """"Converse"""", """"Chuckalos"""", """"Chuckies"""", """"Chuck Ts"""", or """"Chucker Boots"""" or """"Chuck Taylors"""" for the higher styles.[citation needed] For decades the Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe only came in black, with a white variant released in 1947. Under pressure from basketball teams Converse decided in 1966 to manufacture other colors. Different materials also began to be used, starting in the 1970s, including leather, suede and vinyl, and even hemp, rather than just canvas. Besides high-tops, low-cuts and later knee-high versions were produced.
The Weapon
The Weapon, manufactured in many different color schemes

In 1986, Converse released """"The Weapon"""" basketball shoe. Manufactured in two color schemes to match the kit colors of basketball teams, it has been available in both high-top and low cut varieties. The unique aspect of this shoe is the leather construction throughout, including the inside heel which is also heavily padded for comfort. Converse re-released """"The Weapon"""" classic (which Kobe Bryant wore at least three times in 2002 and Andre Miller wore numerous times in 2002 from mid August to early September) several times from 2001-2003 and after, """"The Loaded Weapon"""" in 2003, """"The Weapon 86"""" in 2008, and """"The Weapon EVO"""" in 2009.

The first endorsers of """"The Weapon"""" were Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who were prominently featured in a Converse commercial set in Bird's hometown of French Lick, Indiana in 1986. They were also worn by Axl Rose in the Guns N' Roses music video """"Estranged"""".

I live in Jakarta, I'm not Indonesian and I am objective. 2010 census figure for Greater Jakarta (Jabodetabek or Jabotabek) is 26.6 million, larger than any other candidate except for Tokyo.

Here's my thoughts on the deletion charges: Doughboy sounds like patent nonsense which is CSD#1. Category:World War II campaigns and theaters was a duplicate category. The policy on category deletion is still being discussed, but as far as I am aware, this is not a controversial deletion because you can't redirect categories, so empty ones already replaced by something else can only be deleted. The Conservative Party (UK), Hove and Herbert Stanley Morrison still exist, so perhaps these were only temporary deletes for page moves? Pages are allowed to be deleted for such technical reasons as page moves. The Five-a-side football one was possibly a bit dubious. . 16:50, Aug 25, 2004 (UTC)",0
"Purpose

The purpose of operation Flavius was to prevent the bombing of the military band and the purpose of the PIRA cell in Gibraltar, was to place a bomb in a public place to effect that.  Hiding that is a distortion of both the official IRA statement that they were on 'active service' and the inquest verdict.

Its highly regretable that people are shot on our streets, and unlike some places, its not an everyday occurance. Indeed nobody has been shot since - but although there is no crime of 'being Irish in Gibraltar' it remains the position that terrorists can, and will be shot. Although we do not anticipate any more visits from Ireland, due to the proximity to North Africa there are new threats.

One of the NYT articles cited says that the position with Britain is complicated because it does not have a written constitution - this is sloppy journalism because Gibraltar has one and despite a subsequent version, the section which deals with this incident remains 'as was'.",0

 Other people are named with last initial to protect privacy, even though fully-named elsewhere, per WP:BLP (as: Filomena R. or Laura M.).

 Avoid trying to POV-push anyone's guilt or innocence, just word the text using common phrases, without trying to over-emphasize a legal ruling.
 Remember to use British English, such as: centre, centred, flat (apartment), US (for """"U.S.""""), behaviour, etc.

[changes]

I am a USPS employee. I am not much of an author, nor am I a WP expert (so this is probably in the wrong place and horridly formatted, feel free to fix it), but there have been a lot of changes since the 'sorting mail' section was written. For one, the MLOCR's have almost been entirely phased out and their function is now done by DIOSS machines, which are similar to DBCS machines but have the ability to perform OCR function, as well as take images and spray ID tags on the back of pieces (for mail with addresses that cannot be read by the OCR software), as well as spray barcodes on the front. Also, the article seems to give no mention of DPS, which is a set of sort programs that take local mail (letters only, although the PO is evaluating machines that will do this with flats) and put it in walking (or driving) order for carriers to deliver. There are also lots of other changes, as well as machinery and equipment about which there probably isnt much public information, including the LCTS, APPS, RCS, FSM-100, and FSM-100-AI. There is also the entire PARS system, which is is quite interesting:

 Sorry not to be of more help, but... 
There's a contradiction between the first section which says the USPS is the third-largest employer and the employment section which claims it's the second-largest.  I don't know which it is, but someone should fix that.

Should be the third largest - behind The Dept of Defense and Walmart.  I have changed that three times - I will NOT do it again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.3.50.168   

Removal of 'Monopoly' section
While I removed the 'Monopoly' section prior to reading the discussion pages I firmly stand behind its erasure. The word monopoly is not an appropriate word to describe a quasi-government enterprise.  While describing the USPS as a monopoly may be true in the strictest of terms, the context of its usage is clearly biased.  Historically, the term has been used to describe private entities whose capital power has eliminated all useful and healthy competition. Furthermore, the word is charged with political and economic implications inappropriate for an objective article. By extension of the posters logic, the police, fire, military, the ‘Fed’, PBS, NPR, and others are violators of anti-trust laws as well.  While the USPS does not receive funds from public monies, it’s also not – as far as I know – legislated to make a profit.  Making the USPS the first ‘monopoly’ in the history of capitalist economics to ignore profits and losses altogether.
Your understanding of capitalist economics is somewhat incomplete.  Please review anarcho-capitalism, in which the state is viewed as having a monopoly on social services.  

There are no sources that deny that the USPS is a monopoly and numerous sources that say it is. Of course it is. Any good or service that has no competition is by definition a monopoly. The government forbids competition in letter mail by law. Being a monopoly doesn't require that you're violating anti-trust laws. The USPS is what's called a legal monopoly. I'm going to put the section back in.  01:25, 4 Septem",0

 RfC discussion 

 Hikaru Utada song? 

The song """"B&C;"""" by Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada names """"Bonnie and Clyde"""" in its lyrics. Is this too obscure to be a relevant pop culture reference? Lyrics can be found here.

nothing wrong with popping it in to see if it stays. i don't think it's any more obscure than other stuff there.  

 why wikipedia ultimately sucks 

it requires perpetual vigilance if your effort's not to be wasted. can't walk away from solid ground, job done. this article was stable, and it's now being degraded regularly by wannabe newspaper editorialists and overt point makers, using the """"note insertion"""" method (do a POV jig here, thrust another there). it's like watching a dog wander a field to lift his leg whenever something catches his nose. inserting sentences here and there is the laziest, most worthless """"editing"""" one can do. may as well use a red sharpie. but i'm not touching this article; have at it. convert the investment of many good editors into your pee ground, forcing them either to acquiesce, or follow some snot nose around with kleenex, preserving a precious syllable as able (""""look, johnny, you pooped out a syllable that we kept!""""), arguing for 5 hours with a dull gasbag in the process. idiocy.

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth. Left wing politics can be just as dirty and obfuscatory as right wing politics. - CaptainSurrey""",0

Inflation is always and everywhere the destruction of value in money. This destruction is transferred to constant real value non-monetary items never or not fully updated by the application of the stable measuring unit assumption under the Historical Cost Accounting model since money is the universal unit of account. Monetary inflation is an economic process resulting in the destruction of the real value of monetary items over time leading to an increase in the general level of prices. Historical Cost Accounting inflation is the Historical Cost Accounting practice of never or not fully updating constant real value non-monetary items resulting in their destruction at the rate of inflation when they are never updated or at a lower rate when they are only partly updated over time.

"""Note from the subject book::

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:
«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, """"Vṛndāvana-bhajana."""" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.
Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:
""""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."""" 
How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»

Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:

«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Prabhupāda is here in ADVANCED AGE of 63 starting to write his Bhaktivedanta Purports – I guess in India it was an advanced age, but not in Florida.

Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under """"other free"""".[3]}}

Also, as a Ladin myself, of US origin, I have no desire to play this Italian versus German game.  History is what it is, and to be honest, the Ladin speakers were there WAY before anyone was speaking Italian in the region, or when Germans migrating to the area.  So, to me even Sudtirol is from an alien authority, if you want to be entirely accurate.  But why this constant ethnic tension in Europe?  Sudtirol sounds nice, Tyrol is nice, Alto Adige is nice.  From someone looking into the Province of Bolzano, what I feel I'm seeing is some really radical politics.  I've been told by friends in Trentino that """"Italians"""" don't feel welcome there.

No, being an """"American film critic"""" is her defining characteristic, at least in terms of an encyclopedic entry.  If she had repeatedly proclaimed her Jewishness in her reviews, and had become famous as being a """"Jewish American film critic"""", then that would be important to note in the opening paragraph.  My point about the other critics was not that they are Jewish, but that whether or not they are Christian, Jewish, or otherwise is not even mentioned in the lead paragraphs of their articles.  Why should the Kael entry be any different?  Again, it is already mentioned in the article that her parents were Jewish, so its not like I'm attempting to keep something important from """"public display"""".- 

Of what relevance, is it then, that she is an """"American film critic""""? Since she doesn't deal only with American filims. This refers to her being an American. Why is that there? The plain and simple fact is that she is a Jew, religiously and ethnically. If it is so important that she not be labelled as such then we can just leave it out but let's make your rationale quite clear. -  

Well, the relevance of Kael being described as an """"American film critic"""" is because that is exactly why she is/was famous.  It is standard to discuss somebody's nationality in the lead paragraph of an encyclopedic entry, not their religious beliefs unless that was one of the defining characteristics of their fame.  And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic.  If she was a practicing Jew (and I have no idea if she was or not), she never discussed it in print (as far as I can recall) or in any interviews, and it didn't seem to be reflected in her critical POV.  Now, if she had repeatedly brought up her ethnicity/religion in her reviews as some kind of critical barometer, I could easily understand why somebody would feel compelled to describe Kael as a """"Jewish film critic"""".  But she didn't do that.  And again I direct your attention to any of the other film critic articles on wikipedia.  Is Roger Ebert a """"Christian film critic""""?  Andrew Sarris an """"atheist film critic""""?  Not according to wikipedia they're not.  (I'm using those two as examples...I don't know or care what, if any, religious background they may have).

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,1

 IRB members of the provisional committee 

Since no one seems to have a reliable source on when Plunkett, MacDonagh, and O'Lochlainn joined the IRB, and if it was before the Provisional Committee ceased functioning (evidently in Oct, 1914) saying the IRB held half the committee appears to be unfounded.

  South Carolinians in Baghdad 
'""""9) Pair of S.C. natives at forefront of rebuilding Iraq
By LAUREN MARKOE
The State (South Carolina)
May 31, 2003

George Wolfe, who usually spends his days in the gilded Washington offices 
of the Treasury Department, rode down Baghdad's equivalent of Wall Street 
last week in a convoy of Humvees protected by machine gunners.

""""There were tanks at both ends of the street,"""" the Columbia native said 
this week in a phone call from Baghdad. """"We walked into the Central Bank. 
It was badly looted and burned before the conflict ended.

""""It looked like something out of a post-apocalyptic world. There were 
burned and charred Iraqi dinars blowing around in the breeze.""""

From this, Wolfe and his team are charged with establishing a national 
banking system in which Iraqis can place their confidence.

As the deputy financial coordinator for the Office of Reconstruction and 
Humanitarian Assistance in Iraq, Wolfe also is charged with creating a tax 
system, establishing a currency that does not bear the face of Saddam 
Hussein and setting up the mechanism for turning Iraqi oil into capital to 
rebuild the country.

He has been in Iraq for less than three weeks and is due to return to 
Washington in September. Then he will resume his usual job - deputy counsel 
at the Treasury Department.

Christopher Harvin, another Columbia native, has been working in the same 
downtown Baghdad palace for about the same length of time. From his palace 
office, where the walls are pockmarked with bullet holes, he directs the 
press operation for the American authority.

He also sleeps in the palace - with a South Carolina flag hung proudly over 
his bed.

Before Iraq, Harvin traveled to more than 30 states, working for the Bush 
presidential campaign, and to more than 50 countries as a Pentagon press 
officer, often accompanying Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

But as much as he had seen in his travels, Harvin, like Wolfe, describes 
his life in Iraq as other-worldly - a series of scenes from a bizarre movie.

They live, after all, in a palace that catered to the taste of Saddam 
Hussein. Today, more than 1,000 Americans, Britons and others trying to 
rebuild the nation have made it their temporary home.

""""Think Vegas in the 1950s,"""" Harvin said. """"Giant gold doors. Crystal 
chandeliers. There are four big Saddam busts on the roof, as big as town 
houses. Have you seen the movie 'Casino'? It's living like that.""""

And now - finally - the palace cafeteria serves a down-home favorite.

""""This is sweet tea! This is South Carolina sweet tea!"""" he announced to his 
buddies when he discovered just what he was drinking. """"No joke. This has 
the sugar boiled right into it.""""

Harvin found out the source of the tea was an American cook whose mother 
hails from Lake City.

Harvin has been in Baghdad for three weeks. He has """"no clue"""" when he will 
return to Washington.

In the meantime, he said, his job is to serve the Iraqi people, the 
American cause here - and L. Paul Bremer, head of the American authority in 
Iraq.

""""My role is to image Bremer, to make him look presidential, to give the 
media access to him.""""

Both Harvin and Wolfe are putting in up to 20-hour days under trying 
conditions. Electricity is not always reliable. Harvin sleeps under 
mosquito nets. Wolfe said everything he wears is sweaty and dusty.

They can't leave the palace - once called the Republican Guard Palace - 
without an armed escort. And they are chilled by the recent spike in 
American casualties. Five soldiers died this week; four more were wounded.

Wolfe, once a partner in the Columbia law firm Nelson, Mullins, Riley and 
Scarborough, wears a bulletproof vest and a helmet whenever he ventures 
outside the compound, three or four days a week.

He often returns with stories that astound him.

In the Southern city of Hillah, for example, Wolfe interviewed a group of 
local bankers to """"take a sounding"""" of the industry in the region. He wanted 
to know about their deposits and withdrawals and whether they were making 
loans and collecting payments.

When he asked about security, one banker told him it could be better.

""""Three weeks ago,"""" Wolfe recalled, """"two guys come into his bank with 
machine guns and grenades and said if he didn't give them change, they 
would blow up the bank.""""

Wolfe explained: The 10,000 Iraqi",0

Before i posted this discussion, I asked myself, am I ready for Bdell555's next move, which will be to pretend that the consensus of the editors is not against him, thus requiring me to itemized all the objections?
The issue is, is the article improved by changing the sentence to either of the two versions you have championed, one which shifts it against Hiss, saying """"New evidence has added a variety of information supporting Hiss' guilt"""" or one which states that """"most"""" scholars have concluded Hiss guilty.
One the former, you were specifically criticized by DCGeist and Cberlet.
One the latter, a version of which you are trying to introduce now, KarlBunker came out against it, saying, """"it essentially declares one side of a debate to be the """"winner,"""" and.... It's best for Wikipedia to avoid """"declaring a winner"""" like this unless there's a very clear consensus among scholars.""""
John Z has also specifically criticized you on this change, saying that your version doesn't addresses the concerns of other editors.
So, since I don't think we need to debate RedSpruce's position, we still come up with the same score:
Number of editors who have commented here favoring changing the sentence to either state that new evidence supports Hiss' guilt and/or that most scholars believe him guilty: SIX.
Number of editors who have commented endorsing the change: JUST YOU.

I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -)
Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJK

Someone suggested: """"Heath Robinson"""" and """"Rube Goldberg"""" as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, """"Rube Goldberg"""" is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDC

As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.

I think Americans certainly understand the use of """"bum"""" for """"butt"""", """"rubbish"""" for """"trash"""", and (to a lesser degree) """"flat"""" for """"apartment"""".  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say """"that's a trash can""""; a Brit will say """"that's a rubbish bin"""".  Americans are more likely to use """"rubbish"""" in the sense of """"bullshit"""". LDC

I deleted the following pair: """"limited (Ltd)"""" and """"incorporated"""", since they actually mean different things. """"Incorporated"""" means a corporation; """"limited"""" means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJK

I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.

Yes, I'd call it a """"torch"""", and it would probably be labeled as a """"flashlight"""" in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The Anome

Oh, so """"flashlight"""" is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried """"flashlight"""" only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. AxelBoldt

Speedy deletion of Lev Nikolaevich Korolev
 A tag has been placed on Lev Nikolaevich Korolev requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

"""Harassment ==
As I read the Wikipedia guidelines, Harassment is regarded as far worse than any perceived COI.

 COI 
This is my statement
When I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said """"how would I like to be an associate of the company""""  and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone's career d) Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI.

COI
whatever you think best. I wouldn't mind, but this """"policy"""" seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don't have some vested interests and/or COI. One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it's one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. 
Anyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I'm sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit!

I am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL.

"Howie Payne 

 Hi  Keith D

I would like to protest the changes made by user 92.8.22.187 and subsequent locking of the page by yourself thus protecting his recent subbmissions
I have reverted the changes revisions made by this user several times due to lack of references and dubious POV  submissions.
The user was contacted and referred via previous talk message pages to point out & explain this but despite this continued to revise the page without providing references for the changes submitted. 
As you have now locked the page with these incorrect/unreferenced submissions in place I would implore you to re evaluate the submissions made by user 92.8.22.187 and act accordingly.

I will go into detail here in the hope it may help resolve some the issues with the edits submitted by  user 92.8.22.187:

 I see no reason to now have 4 references to support the spelling of a name that has not been contested. - One of which is a pay site and another that contains a personal address!
User 92.8.22.187 claims I have been changing the spelling of the name here despite his/her addition of references. A quick look will show I have been removing the references for matters outlined above but have not in any way changed the spelling of the name here. 
 The reference to Payne's involvement in The Stands (5) has been changed from a full length interview with Payne about The Stands in a national publication  (Designer Magazine) to review of a solo concert written 3 years after Payne's discontinuation of the group for a local fanzine that briefly introduces Payne as a former member of The Stands before reviewing a solo performance. 
 Payne emigrating to US at age 13 - no reference 
 Edgar Jones's commitment to Paul Weller being the reason for the break up of The Big Kids - No reference - Also Jones was no longer playing with Paul Weller at the time of The Big Kids break up (Winter 2001)  
 The information regarding Pilgrim and Thomson's departure and the subsequent demise of the group as a result of this is wholly misleading - Pilgrim left The Stands in December - 2004 and was replaced by Graham Robinson in January 2005. The Stands then releaesed the single Do It Like You Like  which entered the UK to 40 at no 26 and was used on the worldwide Revelon London Look  campagihn featuring Kate Moss. The Stands then toured with Oasis during both their Europian tour. Luke Thompson left The Stands in June 2005 http://www.gigwise.com/news/6615/Luke-Thomson-Leaves-The-Stands and was replaced by Paul Molloy. 
The Stands released Horse Fabulous in July 2005 played Glastonbury - V Festival - T in the Park - an Oasis UK stadium tour - and a headline tour before Howie Payne released a statement to say he was discontinuing The Stands in Nov 2005. All of this plus the fact that the bands label, Echo records was dissolved by Chrysalis during August 2005 is available on The Stands dedicated wiki page. To sum this up as user 92.8.22.187 has done is totally miss-leading and not based in fact.
Regarding Payne's solo career the new piece mentions Payne spending time in Texas and Los Angeles with neither relevance or reference. 
There is a further edit regarding Payne's name spelling and the submission implies there is a miss-spelling or changed spelling. As the only documents that are can decicivly prove the spelling of a persons birth name are Birth Certificate and Passport and none are provided here I will reserve judgement on this but I do think describing the spelling of Elliot (as here) as standard is ridiculous. There are at least popular spellings of the ame Elliott/Elliot/Eliot/Eliott/Elyott and it would seem the most popular is Elliott.
I do not wish to appear to be pedantic regarding this but as this is typical of the caviler way user 92.8.22.187 has applied vague guesswork and then claimed them facts to the page in question and has accused me of changing his/her referenced submissions which is clearly not the case
 
I hope that as a long standing contributor to wikipeidia you can see that my aim is to prevent this page being a false interpretations of events littered with unnecessary unreferenced/POV information.

The previous page edition 01:30, 25 November 2012 has correct referenced information and I believe is a suitable and proper representation of events as per the information available at this point.

 Requesting information on a banned user 

Dear Mr. Chapman:

I write to you to request information regarding the blocking/banning of User:Mr Spunky Toffee, sockpuppet of User:Brian G. Crawford.  I ask because I had a run-in with him a couple of months ago, in which he attempted to delete a page I had written and insulted me repeatedly.  I was intrigued (but not altogether surprised) to discover a few days ago that he had been blocked as a sock-puppet, but I do know that he had a long history of personal attacks on other users.

What I would like to know is, what was it that got Brian G. Crawford banned from Wikipedia in the first place?  He is not listed on Wikipedia:List of banned users, nor is he included in the Category:Banned Wikipedia users.  His user page states that """"This user is banned from all Wikimedia projects by order of the Foundation.""""  But, the Wikipedia:Banning policy page states that """"The Wikimedia Foundation has the authority to ban users, though it has not exercised this authority on the English Wikipedia.""""

So frankly, I am a bit confused as to what went on here, which is why I am asking you, as you are the one who discovered that Mr Spunky Toffee was Crawford's sockpuppet.  I will understand if this information is confidential or otherwise unavailable; if this is the case please let me know on my talk page.  Or, if you would rather talk to me in private (by e-mail or otherwise), let me know and I would be happy to accommodate you.

I thank you in advance for your assistance.

 re: Intermediawiki linking 

re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).

I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal. ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''

Mike I be putting this whole section in WT:TSP, but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta, and much of our 'good stuff' is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well (Omegatron, CBD, etc.) But here people know me and so this is where it began. Like David, RL called (demanded!) and I went wiki-missing much of last fall, and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wiki's, then iterwikitmp-grp hit Tfd... so that boot in the rear restarted things. I'd really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons! Sigh... life is not a selection of first choices, most of the time we're lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen!  I'll address your points on WT:TSP. But thanks for the interest and input. I like that idea of intersister interwiki's! As for 'What I'm doing', the WP:TSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it.

 Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia 

This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.

Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. 

In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. 

This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable. Please take your time to think about this issue, for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.

The reference to the term """"Homöopathie"""" being first published in 1807 is on page 263 of the Dean article (page 9 of the pdf), although his referencing is a little convoluted - it cites an article called """"Fingerzeige auf den homöopathischen Gebrauch der Arzneien in der bisherigen Praxis"""", referring to ref. 52 which itself refers back to ref. 24 which has it published in Hufeland’s Journal, xxvi (1807), 5–43.  

I'll reword the """"Hahnemann's concept"""" section to include Hahnemann's use of the term """"doctrine of specifics"""" and reference Dudgeon.

I've noticed there's a short """"to do"""" list on the Homeopathy talk page which I might try to work on now that things have quietened down over there.  Do you know of any good but reasonably concise sources (preferably available online) for:

i) the concept of healing crisis in the context of homeopathy;
ii) the work of Constantine Hering and James Tyler Kent and how it differs from Hahnemann?

Wikipedia's Kent article cites your article """"Kent's Influence on British Homeopathy"""" but any additional sources would be gratefully received.

"More efficient answer 

What you wrote in this edit blindsided me so completely that it was hard to understand where you were coming from and so to write an efficiently worded reply.  It's not easy for me to grasp that there could be such a point of view as the one you seem to express.  But having pondered it for some time since you wrote this, I think I can attempt a clear, short, and direct reply.  You wrote:
 
 Sorry if this seems stupid, but I don't know why this article exists. Do we also need to prove that 4 is bigger than 3? That 50 is bigger than 1.2? No.
 
The facts are:
 22/7, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1429.
 It is trivial to demonstrate that fact.
 π, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1416.
 That 3.1429 > 3.1416 is a triviality, not worth an article.
 BUT: The fact that π is approximately 3.1416 can be seen only be first doing quite a lot of work, some of it relying on methods that are relatively sophisticated by comparison to the bare statement that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter, or the like.
 By contrast, the proof given in the article shows that 22/7 > π in a way that is quick and simple, unlike all the work needed to see that π is approximately 3.1416, so you can see that 22/7 > π while skipping all the labor involved in seeing that π is about 3.1416.
 ...and the method by which it is done, in addition to being so short and simple, is elegant, immediately startling, and potentially enlightening in that you immediately wonder if it fits into some larger pattern that would give you insights not otherwise available.
 
You almost seem to treat the fact that π is approximately 3.1416 as if it were self-evident, rather than something that can be seen only at considerable expense.",0

Notability of Brandon Barger
A tag has been placed on Brandon Barger requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

No, actually, we're not here for the same reason.  I don't have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I'm not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don't read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I'm an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia's syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

Libertatia>  """"It strikes me that the an-cap vision being presented here makes the freedom of the market primary, and the freedom of individuals secondary.""""

No, you have it backwards.  Freedom of individuals is the primary; freedom of the market is simply the application of freedom of individuals with respect to production and trade.

Libertatia>  """"Anarchism has never been whatever remains in the absence of the state""""

Right. Anarchism is the philosophy with the goal absense of State.  Of course, anarchists can have other values, too.  E.g. We have various additional values which we want in addition to no  state.  But statelessness  is the primary and defining value of anarchism.

Right. We generally abhor utilitarianism, but of course that is not the only moral basis. We tend to prefer Natural Law rather than utilitarian moral justifications.

I've instructed them to find and kill the people named below and Mr Ken Winn-Pope who has tried to have me killed several times and told thousands of lies about me. Mosaad don't mind the real Al-Qaeda helping them to kill these satanic monsters they agree they are the common enemy not the Americans, Moslems, Christians or Jews. I want them dead their head blown off their shoulders or burnt to death for what I've witnessed they've done to Thai people. My friend Ronnie in the Israeli Government has known me for about nine years, they will be killed that is 100% guaranteed http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 ... some of the people in this film were friends of mine, 150 young men in total killed all innocent people killed by Shinwatra_sylvester-Napier-Cowell's satanic mafia... they were there thinking I was going to arrive to get rid of the problem (the satanists) but I did not know they'd gone there to wait for me... they've killed most of my friends in Thailand most are now dead.

I have met a group of the real Al-Qaeda terrorists in Asia about two years ago and told them who had lied to them about the Americans and how they'd been tricked and brainwashed, the Americans are not satanic. Ive given them the names of the people that terrorised my life and asked them to kill these people who are satanists which includes a man called Winn-Pope whom I believe lied to my wife to turn her against me. Bob Craig-Wood is another name they've been given as well as the Shinawatra-Sylvester family all of whom are satanists. These families kill children and young people to get rich. I was physically (many times) and mentally tortured in Thailand due to their lies http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 this is the work of The Shinawatra family (former WW2 Gestapo families descendants who claimed to be Thai by stealing other people's IDs)... they've killed many thousands of Thai children during the past ten years many many many and tortured many young innocent people to death in the most unimaginable tortures you could never believe someone could think of using, very very very evil... They strapped one girl under a truck then drove it flat out down a highway to petrify her into submission/obedience, others they did this to were petrified to death, very very very evil creatures never trust the Shinawatra Sylvester mafia and their associates Ken Winn-Pope aka John Berisford aka Richard Irwin and he's also claimed to be me.... he is one of the people that helped arranged the game of """"rape"""" in Bangkok many girls their lives ruined by this game an absolutely terrible man.. there have been several cases where they wired a 18-23 year old man up to the mains electricity and electrocuted him for up to nine hours with the cables connected to his private parts, I heard one time this happened and searched furiously to find out where they were doing this in Bangkok. I also heard them torturing very young children physically torturing them for many many hours.. so do not think I am a bad person asking for these satanists to be killed unless you do not care about children and young people who've done nothing whatsoever to deserve to be tortured (there is no justification for torture)..

"""*I want to echo reading over the reliable sources guidelines. The problem is that almost all of the sources you added to the article for Devil Shit are inappropriate for Wikipedia in general in various ways. Merchant sources such as iTunes are wildly inappropriate to use as sources in any way, shape, or form. Their primary purpose is to sell you something and regardless of the information they impart, they should never be used as a reliable, trivial, or even primary source. Secondly, the YouTube links are almost entirely unusable as many are not uploaded by the people that created the music or represent the artist. This is seen as a copyright violation and it's also something that shouldn't be linked to. In almost every case the only time you should link to a video is if it gives notability... which none of these do. Thirdly, the rest of the links are primary, which will never, ever, ever give notability. Never. You could have a primary source that establishes that someone won a Grammy for a devil shit song, but it still can't give notability. You should only list primary sources after you have a reliable source posted by a non-involved second party. The other problem is that with a lot of these sources the claims of devil shit aren't backed up in the actual source. For instance, this Twitter account doesn't say anything about the artist creating anything in this music genre. Saying that the artist performs devil shit based solely on the Twitter account is considered to be original research. You need reliable second party things that back up the information, but even then you have to understand that verification that the genre is performed by notable or non-notable persons is not enough to show notability for the genre to have an article. A genre can exist, but existing is not notability. Even if you re-add all of the sources and the performers without Wikipedia articles, that won't show that the genre is notable. If anything, it actually does a little more to injure the case here than to show notability. If you have 80+ sources, all of which are unusable for notability purposes and most of which are linked to performers that don't have articles (which many automatically presume means """"non-notable"""" even if this isn't the case), then this tends to make many automatically assume that the topic in question is less notable, which means that they might not search as hard as they otherwise would. It's not right that this happens, but it happens. Sometimes in AfDs less is more.    (｡◕‿◕｡)

 Re

Let me help you to be just for one day unbiased:

 It is true that there are """"fringe"""" elements that do not believe in evolution.
 However, someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world.
 Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs...
 The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt.
 ...and nonbelievers in evolution
 Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals?
 Why would you think otherwise?

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166

It is not a matter of how it is taught, but the failure to include the opinions of other reputed minds in the field (whether it be in the form of lawyers, judges or former judges; all of whom are generally the only reputed authors in law, as I'd have expected you to know). Perhaps you are under the impression that no other textbook or essay refers to (and discusses) this case, beyond merely reproducing it.

"A number of people are constantly removing facts, maps, references and adding false claims, such as pertaining to Silesia.

Here are some facts: 
 
All Silesia is situated entirely in Magna Germania territory .

Silesia territory was part of the Holy Roman Empire  by 900 AD (as lien to Moravian, Bohemian dukes). It was conquered by  Boleslaw I Chrobry, a duke of the western Polans, who pledged allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire. The eastern Polans came from the Dnjpr area further west into Germania and are thus named western Polans.

""":Hi there. Thanks for your concern on the matter. I can assure you this has little to nothing to do with """"mathematician vs physicist"""" as you have proposed; it, instead, has everything to do with Linas incompetence. It is univerally acknowledged that a complex function SQUARED can be negative. This is nothing new or exciting: consider f(x) = i if you don't believe me. The square modulus of a wavefunction is what the probability defined in the context of wavefunctions. 

Remarkably, someone who pretends he is so knowledgeable in mathematics and physics - indeed, even stating to me that I do not know Quantum Mechanics and hence should not edit articles - could make such a terrible fumble. Without saying it for effect, his lack of understanding between the square modulus and the square of a complex number if a lack of understanding of day one material: literally, my Complex Analysis book (by Conway, Graduate Texts in Mathematics series) covers it in the first section, and again literally, my mathematical physics course as an undergraduate covered this on the first day of class.

Linas, you are incompetent. People tend to make errors at the periphery of their knowledge. As it turns out, the edge of your knowledge is day one in complex variables. Please refrain from editing articles on quantum mechanics and mathematics. You clearly do not know what you are talking about.

Unless you're a newly hatched pod person, you already know that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is not only truculent but is addicted to being truculent. But let me add that when Positive and Negative Merger Foundation promotes the idea of a """"global village"""" it secretly means """"global pillage"""". What follows is a set of observations I have made about condescending jokers. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's idolators have already started to rob, steal, cheat, and murder. The result: absolute vapidity, shallow and postmodernist cacophony, lack of personality, monotony, and boredom. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation likes scare tactics that bar people from partaking in activities that cannot be monitored and controlled. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that I have to wonder where it got the idea that it is my view that """"metanarratives"""" are the root of tyranny, lawlessness, overpopulation, racial hatred, world hunger, disease, and rank stupidity. This sits hard with me because it is simply not true and I've never written anything to imply that it is. 
If some people are offended by my mentioning that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's vicegerents believe a conspiracy of purblind spoilsports control banking, foreign policy, and the media, then so be it. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's asseverations are in every respect consistent with the school of huffy thought that tends to dilute the nation's sense of common purpose and shared sacrifice. When I state that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is a faithful student of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese strategist who advocated demoralizing one's enemy as the highest art of warfare, I'm merely trying to deal with the relevant facts. Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's true goal is to palm off our present situation as the compelling ground for worldwide deconstructionism. All the statements that its operatives make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics; they do nothing to build bridges where in the past all that existed were moats and drawbridges. 
Despite what you may have been taught in school, I welcome Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's comments. However, Positive and Negative Merger Foundation needs to realize that we must undeniably raise a stink about Positive and Negative Merger Foundation and its insipid perversions. Does that sound extremist? Is it too brainless for you? I'm sorry if it seems that way but that's life. Given Positive and Negative Merger Foundation's record of shady dealings, we can say that its squibs are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot. What's scary, though, is that their extollment of commercialism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up. In summary, things are apt to get worse before they get better. Is anyone listening? Does anyone care?""",0
"""Ten commandments, part 2==
I'm getting tired of having to scroll through several pages to get to the bottom, so I'm starting a new section.  

Let's take a step back.  This article is the """"Ten Commandments"""".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words """"עשרת הדברות"""" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.

This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as """"the Ten Commandments"""" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared """"The Ten Commandments"""".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of """"The Ten Commandments"""" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say """"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.""""

You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number """"Ten"""" in the title """"The TEN Commandments"""" comes from the Hebrew phrase """"aseret had'varim"""" even if you personally think that this was a mistake. 

Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word """"ten"""" and people referring to the """"ten"""" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.

I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title """"The Ten Commandments"""" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew """"aseret had'varim"""". 

So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term """"Uncle Tom"""" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an """"Uncle Tom"""".

Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term """"עשרת הדברות"""".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.

This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to """"The"""" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.

Strange. I was almost sure that Karen Ryan is a pen name of William Mauco, as part of the article Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's Khozyain president from """"Tiraspol Times"""" is copied word-by-word from the article Khozyain from Wikipedia, which was writen by William Mauco. Only after that was discovered started Mauco to write """"officially"""" in TIraspol Times with the name William Maurice. Comparison:

Wikipedia's Khozyain, stub written by Mauco 21 July 2006: Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader. It is rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russians tend to judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. A person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik. A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context. A more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure. Examples of khozyain politicians: Yuri Luzhkov and Igor Smirnov.

article in Tiraspol Times by Karen Ryan, 11 September 2006, part """"The Khozyain president"""": Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader; the prototype of the style of Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's own """"Khozyain"""" head of state. It is a rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russian voters judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. Igor Smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions, from the earliest day of the independence struggle, that what they wanted to create was a society free of """"isms."""" A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context, and, true to form, Igor Smirnov has been called both a """"strongman"""" and, by the more radical Smirnov-haters in Moldova, a """"dictator"""". A more accurate description, for those who understand the true meaning of the word khozyain, would be to classify him as a father figure.

What is sure is that Mauco is pushing everywhere in Wikipedia Tiraspol Times, not only here but in any Transnistria-related page. In an other article he was against the linking to a Russian press agency, he started edit war to include his beloved TT. Probabily he has good reasons for loving it, but I'm still confused: who is William Mauco, William Maurice or Karen Ryan? """,0

-Chess forces personal views, not supported by science

Wikipedia user -Chess participates in vandalism the following way:

Over and over again the Wikipedia user -Chess has been asked on this discussion page to present a known historian or another acceptable source, quote or reference to back up his claims, for instance about his """"16th century"""" Finnish migration theory to Northern Norway, etc.

-Chess has refused to respond to any of these pleas for sources.  Now, that Mr. Chess has changed the Kven text to reflect his personal theories - which are not supported by science - he is attempting to lock and protect the site from reverts and/or further edits.

The Wikipedia user -Chess is forcing his personal views into the Wikipedia Kven text.  Those views are not supported by science.  Not willing to present any sources for the peaces of information inserted by him, the Wikipedia user -Chess is participating in vandalism.

Let it be known, that most parts of the Wikipedia Kven text remaining as of today, which were left standing from earlier contributors, seem accurate.  However, Mr. Chess has attempted to include into the text some of his own ideas, which do not seem to match the opinions of any known historians.  

If Fred Chess disagrees, we once again ask him to provide sources for his claims - even just one source, which could be considered distinguished and reliable.

In his earlier discussion comment above, Fred Chess praises and thanks a respond from user .  However, even that commentator sides against Fred Chess, who - without any scientific foundation, or without any sources presented - tries to present the Northern Norwegian Kvens as a separate and totally non-connected group from the medieval Kvens of Northern Scandinavia.

Wikipedia user  correctly states:  """"Of course, the present Kvens in Northern Norway have a connection with the Finnish-speaking medieval settlers in Northern Sweden and Finland.""""

Claim Number One: """"Tavastians (a group of Southern Finns) were present on the Arctic Ocean alreydy during the Viking Age"""".

Claim Number Two: """"Some believe that the Kvens were the original inhabitants of Northern Norway"""".

Claim Number Three: """" According to Ottar, the Kvens were living in Northern Norway and around the White Sea"""".

When you choose to quote someone, please use the copy and paste technique.  No one has said any of the three sentences above.  You simply changed the wording, to make up goofy sounding sentences, which you claim some one actually wrote.  

Please, explain:  When and where were those sentences written ?  You are simply participating in vandalism, aren't you.

At 13:45, 19 March 2006, using the IP address 130.234.5.136 you added the following sentence to the text which another Wikipedia user had written under the headline Lack of public funding a major cause for lack of information:

""""It's not going to happen, however.""""  You did not return to fix that act of vandalism which you published as a page http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kven&oldid;=44501610.

Just a few thoughts/reccs, do with as you will

Nice significant adds of content.  Kind of leading to following

A. On the Myth section, you've kind of got stuff at both the front and at the beginning that contrasts versus Ovid. 

1. I would move that stuff you have on top of Ovid that is comparisons and then put it down integrated into the later section. cut the summary of the summaries (nuke that).  So it would go 2 equals Myth, no writing, 3 equals Ovid, then 3 equals other myths

2.  Within  Ovid, maybe add some comment about Metamorphoses being wildly popular (RS avail in wiki article for that) at the time and that Ovid;s version is has become the familiar version of t

he myth to present day people.  Then all the story telling.

3.  I like how you've got more meat in Other versions.  But take it even a step further.  Give me some dates.  Let me know if any of the versions were known to have influenced each other or Ovid (don't explain a negative, but if there is anyhing mentione it.  And discuss all the differences in story (you have that).

B.  Not perfect, but would stick the Guardian comment in Interprectation, at beginning or end.  It's commentary on the myth, not literature.

C.  I like the in-article discussion of myrrh.  You will get some who kvetch, but the two are so linked and the term so strange to the modern ear.  I might move all the myrrh stuff except the Latin name (so the Biblical notes and acnient usage) and stick it at the end of etymology and origin.  Follows well after the myrrh-Myrrha word linkage.  And explains the substance a little earlier in article (so doing more good).  Only bad thing is you lose the connection to the image of myrrh.  could just switch back to lady bug though.  donno if there is a way to fit two images in that tiny Origins section.  you do have pics of the tree anyhow in the form of her transformation.

Well, I'll tell you a dirty little secret about Wikipedia.  Lots of good contributions do not have references.  Particularly about maths, science and technology.

Nonetheless, it is good to see such fictitious people emerging and these new 'entities' are probably one among the scores of sock-puppets being used for manipulation on wikipedia.  

It is of course pointed out that I have not made any personal attacks but pointed out not just glaring contradictions and discrepancies but also but steadfast refusal of such 'contributors' to realize these points and make corrective action.

I have posted in detail above about my contributions on the Chola dynasty and explanations and justifications for such postings along with not just the sources but also the quality of such sources and information.

I am indeed waiting for detailed discussions in case required. Unless that is done, any deletion of my contributions without assigning reasons is also as improper, as per established Wikipedia norms, as posting or making additions to an article without giving sources and references.

I am sure a neutral admin like Taprobanus and other contributors from the Tamil Nadu group will certainly reason in my trying to better the quality of the article on Chola Dynasty.  

Through the medium of this post, I also request the admins to initiate a debate on the origins of the so-called 'Chalukya Chola dynasty' which according to me never existed... (all the inscriptions right from Kulothunga I to the last Chola king Rajendra III) bear evidence to the fact that these kings either directly or indirectly, NEVER addressed themselves as Chola Chalukya or Chalukya Chola.  It is again the handiwork of manipulators who seek to maintain and continue the title Chalukya Chola.  By the same token kings after Vikramaditya VI in the Chalukya page should be called Chola Chalukya because that king was a son in law of Virarajendra Chola.. and Hoysalas after Veera Ballala II starting with his son Veera Narasimha should be called Hoysala Chola or Chola Hoysala because Ballala II was a son in law of Chola king Kulothunga III.

 1999 Izmit earthquake

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research.

If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what """"racist"""" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.

You are missing the point. The phrase you quote is in a summary of other scholars' arguments. When summarizing the view of a sub-group we are not supposed to render our opinion on whether their arguments are valid. Nor do we decide whether to include their views on the basis of whether their views are consistent with wikipedia editorial policy. If a substantial minority of scholars argued that Julius Caesar's astrological chart ought to be considered historical evidence, it would be incumbent upon wikipedia to report that in the relevant article. An absurd example, but I hope it illustrates how you are missing the point. Furthermore, as for the scholars' argument itself, they are not arguing against """"methodological naturalism"""" or history as an """"empirical science."""" In fact, many evangelicals offer mounds of evidence (convincing or otherwise) for their views (including single authorship of Isaiah) that adhere to methodological naturalism and empirical science. See Kenneth Kitchen's On the Reliability of the Old Testament (Eerdmans, 2003) for the most significant example. Rather, by """"outmoded modernist presuppositions,"""" evangelicals typically refer to practices and assumptions of source critics that are even now recognized as obsolete by secular scholars. For instance, the assumptions held by former adherents of the documentary hypothesis are now rejected, leading to Neo-Documentary Hypothesis proponents (e.g., Jeffery Stackert at University of Chicago) that rely less on such outdated methods and assumptions. 70.131.155.15

"As I understand it, a civilization as it continues to advance and reaches a certain point it is no longer broadcasting into open space (as we have been doing since the 1930s), and instead reaches a point where all telecommunications are directed from space-bound craft back to Earth (think about our cable and satellite TV and radio overtaking conventional broadcast TV and radio). A Dyson sphere is the ultimate form of this concept. So, basically it is important for our planet to intentionally broadcast these types of scientific messages, as our unintentional broadcasts become less prevalent.

Reviewing your sources.... """"MSM in Africa"""" does not contain the string """"trans"""" anywhere in the document.  I don't know what you expect in that document being used as a reference, except to increase your refcount.  UNAIDS states that """"TG is typically considered alongside"""".  It is fairly equivocal about the whole matter.  The Powerpoint Document gives the most convincing argument with the statement: """"With regard to HIV surveillance and prevention, the CDC’s current practice is not to separate MTF TG and TS people from the MSM category, with no attention paid to the risks of FTM TG people."""" (A noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here... it amounts to hearsay.)  The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as """"MSM"""" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as """"MSTGW"""" and not """"MSM"""" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: """"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as """"balls."""" These social networks include """"houses"""" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000).

My conclusion... I have to admit, I've been viewing TG too narrowly, and excluding individuals that are TG, yet also MSM.  However, that doesn't mean that TS individuals are MSM... it's hard to argue that a drag queen isn't MSM, while it is hard to argue that a post-operative MTF living a life in stealth is an MSM.

"Recent AfD on Christianity and Judaism ==

Hi! I see that you were one of the participants in the recent AfD on the article Christianity and Judaism.  That AfD recommended (in a snowball result) that the article be merged into Judeo-Christian.  However, since the AfD concerns have been raised, most notably
 Per WP:ADJECTIVE and WP:MOSNAME, we use nouns and noun-phrases for article titles, not adjectives.  So a general survey on the relationships between Christianity and Judaism (a topic this encyclopedia should certainly cover) should be called Christianity and Judaism, as per the articles Christianity and Islam, Islam and Judaism.
 The reason the article Judeo-Christian exists, as its own hatnote declares, is specifically to survey the history and use of that word-phrase  which has its own controversy, and its own tale to tell.  (See here where I've set things out in a bit more detail.)  That story is a good fit for its own article, and will get completely lost if the contents of Christianity and Judaism get inappropriately dumped on top of it.

Having contacted the closing admin, his advice was to open a new discussion at Talk:Christianity and Judaism, advertise the discussion widely, and if a new consensus can be reached in that discussion [his emphasis], then per WP:CCC the new consensus should be followed, rather than the AfD decision, without the need for a DRV or a new AfD.

Concerns about the proposed merge have also been expressed by ,  and .

This post is therefore to let you know that that discussion is underway, at Talk:Christianity and Judaism#Overly speedy deletion, with a view to perhaps setting aside the AfD decision.  

Of course, some significant issues were raised in the AfD about the article in its present form, so the best way forward is a question that needs some thought.  Please feel welcome to come and participate!

 Operation Northwords 
Listing Operation Northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of Conspiracy Theory that this article gives. If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a """"coordinated group"""" which """"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities"""" then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act. This is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory.   

 Conspiracism 

The section conspiracism says:

'Conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. 

This phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: """"often taken not seriously"""" (has anybody made a statistic?) """"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence"""" (how many?) and it happens """"almost by  definition""""(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence???  

If nobody has nothing to comment about that I will delete the sentence above.  

I disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but  guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them (vide the 9/11 passport [I don't want to argue was it fabricated - I mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]).   

 Sequence of sections and bias 

The way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong POV and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. First problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. This should be towards the end of the article. Also there is the descriptions:

The John F. Kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. Oliver Stone's film JFK is based on this premise.

While this is a conspiracy theory, one I think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. Other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by Cuba or the Soviets. The UFO conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, """"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.""""

Also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w",0

How could it be affirmed that the majority of the public know the names from the Funimation broadcast? Is there any source stating that? Even if that were true, Dragon Ball is known in almost all the English-speaking world, not only in the US. And that's not including the rest of the world. More importantly, the manga is the primary work, and normally the main source for most information regarding a work of fiction it's the printed work, like most American comic-book characters like Superman, Batman, Wolverine, etc.
These are the key phrases to decide what names to use:
WP:ENGLISH
""""Use the most commonly used English version of the name of the subject as the title of the article, as you would find it in verifiable reliable sources (for example other encyclopedias and reference works)."""" I honestly don't think that reliable sources will be found about this topic, at least not like encyclopedias and reference works, which leaves us with the following policy.
WP:MOS-AM
""""Characters should be identified by the names used in the official English releases of the series. If there are multiple English releases, such as both a manga and anime, use the one that is best known and that has contributed most to the work's becoming known in the English-speaking world (usually the primary work)."""" This is the key one. We have to decide which one has contributed more to Dragon Ball becoming known in the English-speaking world. In my opinion, it was the manga, since Dragon Ball has been known for a very long time thanks to it, and, in the US, the first broadcasts of the anime where unsuccessful while the manga was already a success, and I have the impression that it was this success with the manga that lead Funimation to keep on trying. But again, this is not definitive. We need the opinions of people from other English-speaking countries in order to have a more accurate perception.
If we want accuracy, which is also desirable by other Wikipedia policies, we should use the romanizations given by the author (Toriyama) in his Japanese works and then include the alternatives as stated in WP:ENGLISH. After all, most guidelines aren't meant to be a strict rule. But for the moment, first we have to define which one, manga or anime, helped more in making Dragon Ball known in the English-speaking world. And remember, US TV is not the whole English-speaking world. And if we go by the primary work, it's manga.   """,0

I have made some edits that are (hopefully) viewed as an improvement on the original.
 I added references to both the T568-A and T568-B """"standards"""" to the pinout tables.
 I copied (and modified) the original table, showing it as a four-pair crossover, since the newer network types need all four pairs crossed.
 I added explanatory comments about the T568-A/B wiring formats, since in my experience this has been a source of confusion. (They really are interchangeable, you just need to use the same format at each end.)
 I also inserted comments between the two pinout tables explaning that there may be situations where the """"older"""" style may be preferable - and that some equipment can be fussy about which pairs are crossed, and which are not.
 I broke out the """"Cable Pinouts"""" and """"Other Technologies into separate sections to make things clearer.

Comments:

Thanks to whomever added the pictures and the original table.  They really help liven up the page and make the information much more easily grasped.

Regarding the comment about """"Wikipedia not being a 'user manual' but merely a 'source of information'...""""  Where do you/we draw the line?  I came to Wikipedia, as a source of information, and in this case the """"how-to"""" kind of information is often what the visitor wants.

In my own case, I came here looking for information about how to make the cable and found the tabular form for the pinout (now pinouts) most instructive.

Constructive criticism is welcomed.  Flame-mail to /dev/null. ( -) )

Your request for rollback

Hi JohnSRoberts99.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).  I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into troubles or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback.  Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism.  Happy editing!  雲‍水 """,0

 Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.
Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   """,0
"""Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia's invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92.35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos' 92.35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend-business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41/2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don't know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6,500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio-naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, 2007, Queen Beatrix’s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel’s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen's palaces’ computer). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided """"incomplete and false information"""" about Bruinsma was changed to just """"incomplete information"""" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog's U.P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add """"the thing."""" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A.B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this reason: links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to read more meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial's evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there.
Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that's his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares-Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub-section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative.

Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal,  Spring, 2001  by Monica Boyd,  Doug Norris]:

 """"At the close of the twentieth century, """"Canadian"""" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this """"indigenous"""" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in """"Canadian"""" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.""""

""":::::: The numbers are indeed possible. First is that the numbers from the 1997 election cannot be used to compare to the current one becuase this was before the point in which the youth would take on a much bigger position than they did today. the conservatives were still around and the youth could not vote then, but now the youth can vote and the conservatives have either died or changed to rather anti-Ahmadinejad. The conservative candidate was nothing like ahmadinejad so he could have had a good 8 million votes. And if you add Rezaee votes with it it comes around 9 million for the consevatives in total. 60% of iran is under 30, and they only know problems under this regime or more specifically, this administration. Besides Ahmadinejad is massively unpopular and the numbers from his previous election are going to decrease because of the increase in sanctions and further isolation from the rest of the world. YOu cannot think that his approval will go up because the nuclear program was started long before ahmadinejad, he just publicized it and his threats against Israel further promoted them, He makes useless provocations against the Holocaust, going as far enough to invite David Duke to tehran to talk about it, and this is not going to promote him very well. Next, most of the programs in Iran were started in the Khatami or even Rafsanjani administration. so the fact the claim that he is supporting the poor is dubious and the Iranians realize this because he has slowed them down or stopped them wholly, in order to pay russia or the military. And he has also placed Gas rationing on one of the largest producers of oil in the world. Point, being Ahmadinejad is not going to be quite popular, even within the conservative corners of the government. Karroubi is popular where ahmadinejad supposedly is so I dont see anything wrong with his votes and the upper class and middle class are going to vote for mousavi. Some of the lower class are going to vote for mousavi since they remember his handeling of the economy in the 80's so that will give him lots of extra votes. Rezaee is still really hated due to his running of the revolutionary guard in the 80's. And do you think that the government was going to tolerate a runoff between two reformists that each got more votes than the conservatives combined. Absolutely not in a million years. So the numbers are reasonable as mentioned above. Next is that you cannot rely on polls in Iran or whatever any government group is going to say. The polls that are """"official"""" are made by the government. you know what I mean. and the groups (the islamic participation front) cannot know the exact extent of their popularity because the people fear evin if the open their mouths.

Second point is that i might have contradicted myself earlier. Any memo that is made by the government is going to have the seal on it, making it offical, period. It does not have any numbers in order to prevent trails as I mentioned Earlier. 
Im going to leave this on the page. The first reason is that the letter, wheather fake or not, is being widely circulated around Iran, so it is being used as a catalyst to the protests. The second is that Wikipedia is not a forum in order to determine wheather or not a document is fake or not, If the document is of encyclopedic value, as it is being actively used within the situation as it is in the protests it should be kept. wheather it is fake or not, It is evidence that is being actively used there is vote rigging, (Talk)

Sergio Gadeo finished ninth overall and achieved 2 third place finishes giving the team an impressive 11 podiums in their first season. Marick Viñales won the Gran Premio Gernerali de la Comunitat Valenciana, the final Grand Prix of the season, earning points for both Blusens by Paris Hilton Racing and Aprilia who won the 125cc Moto GP World Manufaturers Championship.

 Morphology 

I think that a few words should be written about endings of various kinds, and of distinctions of cases.  There seems to be some misunderstandings here and there in the project, with claims that """"German has preserved the proto-germanic grammar"""" or similarly.  This is not 100% true (although German certainly has preserved much of the grammar).  I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.  I do not think we should try to reproduce all paradigms; but some representative sample.  (However, I just know them from rather old books; and these books do not very carefully distinguish different epochs or dialects within the OHG.)
I had in mind an example like this:

    Sing.    Pl. N    tag    taga G    tages    tago D    tage    tagum A    tag    taga I    tagu    (not distinguishable)

and a few words on how e.g. 1:st and 3:rd p. pl. of the verbs then were quite distinct (in pres. ind. normally ending in -mes and -nt, and in pret. -m and -n, respectively); where in the modern language a final -m is replaced by an -n, making the forms indistinguishable.  Is this sensible?  """,0

I'm saving some material for a longer summary at dream house, as well. Unfortunately, I have no statistics on car accidents in Italy following the creation of dream house. (The outlooks at the time did seem a bit idealistic.)

Also, I've read that dream house was just a name used outside of Italy to market what was called """"Mediterranean progressive house"""" domestically. The problem is, there are no Google hits for this term expect in reference to Gigi D'Agostino (one of which is that very article). Anyone able to corroborate this? – """,0

You're being negative and unhelpful. I did not """"the thumbs down on my talk page before you got around to the article itself"""", the draft itself is automatically a """"Wikipedia Talk"""" page due to the nature of the WP:Articles for Creation format. But instead you prefer to leap to the conclusion that I did not read your article, despite it being clearly on a """"Talk"""" page for admin reasons, like all AFC articles.

Secondly, I did not say that NYT isn't """"notable"""", so that's a specious allegation. You have overall not provided reliable coverage since you've provided only one single source. You allege that """"So a mass panic in two NYC borough's is not notable enough then? Really!""""; well, that's true per Wikipedia:Notability_(events)#Duration_of_coverage: Notable events usually receive coverage beyond a relatively short news cycle. As very clearly stated in my comments: if this 1939 event is important, than people since 1939 will at least have occasionally mentioned it. It is incumbent on you as the submitter to find evidence that it has ever been discussed since.

I don't appreciate your allegations that I have failed to WP:AGF. I have followed AFC procedure, treated you politely, given explicitly clear indications of what should be fixed, and I have not deleted/blanked/salted your draft, but have simply Declined it. If you think I'm somehow a minority opinion, by all means visit WP:AFC Help Desk and ask for a different reviewer to take a look.

I don't appreciate your abusive language like """"pathetic"""", and it's quite inappropriate of you to take something as incredibly minor as a temporary decline (and the vast majority of article drafts get several declines and improvements before being published, it's not some binary """"amazing""""/""""terrible"""" judgment for eternity). And it is quite overblown to feel slighted by a rejection and instantly leap to railing against the gods, accusing other people of being """"pathetic"""" and lambasting the Wikipedia project, which you were evidently quite interested in contributing to prior to receiving even the slightest constructive criticism. If you are unable to accept positive suggestions and feedback, you will most likely not enjoy editing Wikipedia; you must be able to tolerate developing consensus and working in a collaborative environment.

Quicksilver, you can speculate about indígena, but until you find some other notable source which puts forward this proposed derivation, it should not be included. IMO this is highly fanciful- if this is to be explained as an english corruption of a spanish word, how do you then account for the very many references in spanish documents of the time, to los Indios"""" (the people) and """"las Indias"""" (the place)? Surely native spanish speakers themselves would not get confused between """"indígena"""" and references to the East Indies (""""las Indias Orientales""""). Whether Columbus really believed what he wrote about reaching the Indies, we can only speculate- Eratosthenes's relatively accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference was only one estimate amongst many, was not generally held, and AFAIK we've nothing to indicate that Columbus accepted or relied on this figure. | TALK 02:49, 2005 September 5 (UTC)

 Cultural depictions of George Byron, 6th Baron Byron 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.

"The problem with the girl on a nebulizer is that the image is such poor-quality (terrible lighting, poor resolution) that whatever subtle distinguishing elements that would render this as illustrative of CF (to the exclusion of all other respiratory conditions) are completely lost - it looks like a girl with a breathing mask, and while it could be for CF, it could just as easily be for chronic asthma, bronchitis, allergies, or maybe she just doesn't like the shampoo her mom used on the rug (:-)). Simply put, this image doesn't illustrate this condition - we cannot see sticky mucus, or anything that would allow even a trained medical professional to make the diagnosis of CF just from looking at it. It's a touching image, and I understand why some may be attached to it - but as an encyclopedia, we need to base our decisions on more logical, objective standards. The end result of using the nebulizer picture in the lede is to make the article look amateurish - a picture of someone missing an arm is good for an article about amputation, but a picture of someone in a knee brace isn't really such an iconic example of a ACL tear that it'd be fit for the lede there.

Well, there was a hot war going on in the background of TYOLD (the Konfrontasi) - the whole """"Living Dangerously"""" line was based around Sukarno's words ushering in of hot conflict against Malaysia, UK, etc. But on the point of Indonesian Civil War - at least at the beginning of '65, there was indeed some combat between the """"G30S"""" forces and those loyal to Suharto. I'm of the opinion that the period of combat was brief, and that after Jakarta was seized by Nasution-Suharto loyalists the casualties were very lopsided - hence, why the PKI's Central Committee-in exile called it just a """"White Terror."""" 

But of course, however, the same group criticized Aidit for not adhering to Mao's """"People's War"""" doctrine - so one could imagine that there were those sectors of the PKI that were spoiling for a conflict. Hence, I titled it Indonesian Civil War rather than Indonesian White Terror or Indonesian Coup - it keeps things NPOV and open to different scholarly interpretations.

By, I should point out that I have an interesting hard copy """"self critical"""" document the PKI Central Committee published from China detailing what they perceived as their mistakes in '65 and attempts to re-establish the Party.

"""::: Yes, that was an RPJ rant. But criticism articles really are required sometimes (here's a great example) and often they create clutter if all the separate objections to an idea are left in place. The general rule is that the minority views can be collected as a subarticle, so long as care is taken to treat them as a subarticle by somehow summarizing them in the main article (this does not have to be exhaustive), and vice versa, which probably we should be careful to do in the main JFK assassination article. And so long as rebuttal on both sides is a part of both articles, which I hope we've accomplished here by having a good section on the one-shooter WC view in the JFK assassination theories article, and mentioning that other views than the WC's exist, in the main article.In line with Wikipedia's semi-policy of assuming good faith, the creator of the new article is probably sincerely convinced that there is so much information about a certain aspect of a subject that it justifies a separate article. There is no consensus whether a """"Criticism of .... """" article is always a POV fork. At least the """"Criticism of ... """" article should contain rebuttals if available. And the original article should contain a summary of the """"Criticism of ... """" article. I know I'm going to get flack for pushing so heavily for the WC view even in light of the fact that supposedly it's not the most popular view among the general public. Unfortunately, the general public's view is not informed, and is warped by the slick Oliver Stone JFK, which no movie producer is going to spend as much money to rebutt with a movie which is true to facts as we know them; plus the HSCA shocker with the dictabelt, which got way more airtime than ITS rebuttal, later. All of this being symptomatic of one of the problems which drives WP:V toward untruthfullness, which is that TRUTH is quite often dull and not very entertaining, and sometimes it's hard to find spokespeople for it.

"Simple quote
Don't you think this essentially Kantian (or maybe Hegelian) view expresses a sentiment that lies at the heart of the misgivings that many have about adopting an excessively pro-scientific stance?

Almost every scientist I have ever spoken to about the nature of science believes that scientists study the world 'out there' ; in other words, they study an objective world devoid of human emotions and meaning. They find it quite difficult at first to understand that what they are really studying is the phenomena - the mental representations of the world 'out there'. Once thus enlightened they can then perceive that their knowledge of the world 'out there', far from being objective, is intimately bound up with, and inseparable from, their hopes, fears, and other emotions. The world is one thing, and our knowledge of it is another ; we ought not to imagine that our understanding of the world is the world itself. James, Norwich

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

"German Ship Prefix of Donau? 

Hello, I'm planning to write an article about the Donau in German. But can you tell me what the german Ship prefix is?
Is it the international prefix SS or the german prefix DS (Dampfschiff = Steam Ship)? I also have a source that writes M/S for Motor Ship,

Observation of Barack's bio or The Wiki-Obama standards of political content and style

I find it curious the Biography of Barack Obama has not one negative element to it.  It reads like a campaign mailer, with glowing remarks and fawning reverence for Mr. Obama.  In observing this article, and comparing in to, McCain's, Sarah Palin's (see typical example here   and other Republican office holders biography, the Republican ones are filled, with all sorts of negativity, red herring,  and plain old guilt by association.  Now if considering the precedents and standards, as they were up held on this article and vigorously defended by those with like """"Scjessey"""" and """"Wikidemon"""" and others I will conclude these are considered to be typical and reflect the consensus of those on Wikipedia.  As such I will take it a step further and  apply these precedents of style and content or what I would like to coin the """"Wiki-Obama standards of political content and style"""" on Republican office holders biographies, with equal and fair vigor as it has been applied here on the Obama's Biography.
This must be done, in order to bring true fairness and non-partisanship, as well good balance and neutrality to the Political biographies on Wikipedia.

Again: please provide """"diffs.""""  Paraphrasing and using words like """"inhumane"""" which I myself did not use does not substantiate any claim of my engaging in any such """"PA"""" (personal attack).  I did not engage in any such thing.
I did not """"accuse"""" anyone of anything and certainly did not use uncivil or offensive language, though others did so in that AN/I (see the editing summary, which contains improper expletive language by another user); I said that a user repeatedly seems to lack humane compassion and linked to (earlier version of) my current """"N.B.""""

""": Orange, Thank you very much for your thoughtful comments. 

 I've read that Wikipedia is interested in the product, not the process. ZZM is obsessed with the process, and presents endless hurdles to improving the product. He constantly quotes Wikipeida policies to me. If I want to make a change, I am violating WP:XXXX, he tells me every time. I understand there is a Wikipedia policy that says """"ignore all rules"""" WP:IAR and another that says, don't be a WP:DICK.

 Of course, the one thing ZZM clains over and over is that his right to do whatever he wants, and for me this behavior is very disruptive, is justified by WP:OWN, that I don't own it. He's can't hold off for a few hours when I ask him, so that I can finish something.  Doesn't this violate WP:DICK? But seriously, WP:OWN is just an excuse for endless circular edit wars, because the answer to I don't own it is that he also doesn't own it. But that brings up one more thing.

You really need to chill out however, because I am afraid either you will be blocked from editing certain articles (along with ZZM, I would hope) or you will get frustrated and refuse to participate (not very mature if you did that).  

You say, """"not very mature if you did that""""? Pardon me, but one thing that I do own is my own life, my own time, and my own abilities. Right now, the article Judaism and evolution is a polished and sourced article from the heading """"Jewish opposition to Darwinian evolution"""" on down. Above that heading, the article is a mess of unsourced quotations, mostly. Those quotations are generally correct, and do give a good sense of what mainstream Jewish opinion is on evolution. But turning what is there now (and all the other material that is available) into a real article is going to be a lot of work. Of course, somebody else could do that work, and somebody else will eventually come along who wants to. But am I """"not mature"""" if I don't want to? No, my life is my life!

Based on my experience with ZayZayEM, who has followed me from one article into several others already, I don't want to work on it. I've got to have a life, celebrate Pesach, visit my aging parents, and more. I'm willing to work on this material if I don't have to deal with ZayZayEM. I welcome the participation of people like you, Shira, Jay, jmabel, IZAK, and others who follow reasonable editing patterns, use Talk pages, and so forth.  

I've tried to talk several of my friends into becoming Wikipedia editors. They are people who could make huge contributions. I know that if any of them ran into ZayZayEM, that would be the end of their contribution to Wikipedia. 

Do you understand my contention that following a person from one article into another and yet another, is a form of stalking, and that it makes me extremely uncomfortable, even if the fellow is halfway around the world? That's why I asked to have my User page sanitized last week. (All old entries to it were erased.) I used to have personal information about my family on that page.

Not everyone believes this crap, copied from AN/I
I do not know either John254 or Kristin Erikson and recently stumbled across this. But, I have to say this looks like a witch hunt with evidence that wouldn't even hold up as circumstantial. They can't prove they're not socks, so they must be. And any evidence to the contrary is more proof because it must have been deliberately planted. If we ban then and they drown, then they must have been innocent after all. Personally, I've been editing Wikipedia since the beginning (late 2001), both as an IP user and with an account that I have abandoned, so I fully understand KE appearing on Wikipedia knowing more than you think a new user """"""""should"""". I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.
Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?
Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.
At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. 
To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.

First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your """"sky is blue"""" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that """"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris"""". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that """"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower"""" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   """,0

"For Viajero 

Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:

- Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.

- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. 

- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.

- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. 

- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.

- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.

- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.

Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here. OH, and by the way, Please, before reverting something please stated why are you reverting it.   15:19, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)",0

John: As you know the lead-in sentence for this article is In mathematics, a bivector is a quantity in geometric algebra that generalizes the idea of a vector. That is, this article in WP is about the bivector in geometric algebra (although it could be redesigned to deal with tensor algebra, I suppose, which topic is presently an afterthought at the end). As such, the section on Vector algebra is a subheading of the main topic, the bivector in geometric algebra. Consequently, the reference to the pseudovector in this subsection should make note of the predominant usage in texts on geometric algebra, namely that the bivector in 3D is the pseudovector, just another example of the (n-1) grade multivector being the pseudovector. No? Do you disagree about the common usage?

On that basis it is not exactly a mis-statement but certainly an easily mis-read statement in the article that says: in geometric algebra axial vectors are usually interpreted as bivectors. In fact, what is usual and less open to misconception is  Ławrynowicz """"Hence in 3D we associate the alternate terms of pseudovector for bivector, and pseudoscalar for the trivector"""".

I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).

Russia still has a largely Soviet-era nuclear arsenal, ergo, most of its ballistic missiles are technically past the expiry date and RF has been supposed to DEcommission hundreds of missiles each year for the past 20 years or so (which is not to say it has been doing it!). Meanwhile, as far as is publicly known, it has been commissioning about half a dozen, or a dozen on a good year. Thus overall, its nuclear arsenal has steadily shrunk.

"""

Jack-A-Roe, thank you for responding.  That article says, """"Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation.""""  That raises a question:  In writing the article, I paraphrased the Material (well, some of it).  It seems to me that paraphrasing is necessary when conveying information  I mean, Seth/Roberts published 20 books; and when they discussed a topic, it was discussed in depth.  So my question is:  Is paraphrasing considered to be """"interpretation""""?  To me it is not interpretation, but others might say it is.

It would seem that Verbal thinks I am interpreting instead of paraphrasing.  But since he isn't a knowledgeable editor  meaning an editor with knowledge of the subject matter  I don't see how he can know that.  Verbal, acting on the assumption that I have been interpreting instead of paraphrasing, has been trying to block any new primary sources that I might add.

Now, the article also says that primary sources must be used """"with care"""", but it doesn't say that they can't be used in abundance.  In a case like this, I don't see why the sections that describe the Material can't be abundantly sourced to the Seth books.

I really do have a handicap when it comes to finding secondary sources (what I've been calling """"third-party"""" sources up to now).  I have always been interested in the Seth material, not metaphysics in general.  Thus, I have almost all the Seth books, but few other books on metaphysical subjects where references to Seth/Roberts might occur.  (I do have many Cayce and Casteneda books, but they don't say a thing about Seth.)  Finding more secondary sources is difficult for me because my town has a small library and (you'll be amazed by this) I don't have a car to drive to the nearest city.  However, it seems to me that, given the sale of 8 million books and the secondary references that are already in the article, notability has already been established.

Because I was the only person here who was able to keep reverting Verbal's cuts to the article, I am now being accused of edit-warring.  There's the possibility that I won't be around to prevent Verbal from chop-chop-chopping at the article.  That being the case, I hope you'll stick around.  """,0

Ernie Smith writes 

Æµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators.  That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.""""  I went on to state that """"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.  The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric..."""" 

Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii).  So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language"""" does not make this practice Afrocentric.

To User:DESiegel

I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the """"N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).

In Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  """"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?""""  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

 Good job UC Bill. Thanks. I submit that all we need to settle out of this ArbCom is whether or not the previous RfC, where the community rejected “son of autoformatting”, was a fair and proper reading of the community consensus. Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom because he said that RfC had been rigged with slanted questions. It appears that you are conceding that, while you back your code, you acknowledge that the community doesn’t want “son of autoformatting”. If that is the case, I think we are done here on ArbCom on that issue.Wikipedia is a hobby; we’re all volunteering our efforts. And I would dislike it a great deal if I worked on something that few Wikipedians wanted. If I were you, I’d solicit input on what exactly the community wants through RfCs of your own. I’d also drop posts on the talk pages of known opponents of “son of autoformatting” (like Tony, Dabomb87, Ohconfucious, and me) in order to get a clear understanding of what the community would really like to receive, and then go to work on that.

I would counter your argument by saying that as it pertains to this issue, which hospital he was born in is not a """"minor factoid"""". Especially considering that the location of his birth has been disputed and that it may affect his eligibility to be President. A little more looking into the matter reveals to me that the possible basis for the claim that he was born at that particular hospital is a statement by his sister in 2008 claiming such, and nothing else (at least that I can find). Do you find it an unreasonable stretch to suggest that his sister might be incorrect and that further verification would be reasonable?   """,0

I'm not sure I get your point.  Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.

 Carbon-Carbon 

Perhaps that could use a little more explanation, then. Carbon brakes  are carbon on carbon, in that the material is used as both brake pad and disc. However, the material used is a carbon-carbon composite: carbon fibres set in a carbon matrix (see Reinforced carbon-carbon for more technical stuff). It could actually be either reason I suppose, but they are normally referred to as 'carbon-carbon'. The topic is discussed in greater detail further down the article - I've put a '(see below)' at the first appearance of 'carbon-carbon' which links to the 'Technical innovation' section further down.

""", I concur with White Guard that Lenin and his government committed many atrocities against the Russian people, and your attempt to 'whitewash' their reputation is somewhat historically inaccurate (please don't take this as a personal attack). As for the kulaks, you're perfectly correct that they never really existed as a class, and were invented by the Communists as an attempt to encourage 'class warfare' in the countryside - yet you choose to ignore the fact that it was Lenin, not Stalin, who began the campaign against the kulaks. It was, admittedly, Stalin who was responsible for the wholesale purging of kulaks as part of his collectivisation programme. Overall, I would say Stalin took Lenin's ideology to new heights of paranoia and mass murder - but the foundations of this ideology were all in the system that Lenin established. Stalin was worse than Lenin, but there wasn't a clean historical break between the two - they were part of the same authoritarian and brutal Communist tradition.  

 What Is To be Done?-Part III 

Further remarks are obviously required.

ANTI-SEMITISM.  Could I please have a reference for Nicholas' authorisation of the Kishinev massacre?  As far as I am aware this episode was the handiwork of Vyacheslav Plehve, minister of the interior and a notorious anti-semite.  The pogrom was condemned by the governor of Bessarabia and by the central government.  Sergius Witte, by far the Tsar's best minister, made his own feelings on the matter plain.  

There were pogroms in Tsarist Russia, and anti-semitism was a long-established and poisonous tradition.  The point is that this cannot always be traced back to the Tsar: Russian state and government was far too complex for that.  Official anti-semitism was, moreover, of a confessional rather than a biological nature.  Under Alexander III the drive for assimiliation became ever greater, after the murder of his liberal-minded father, but it also affected Catholics, Lutherans and Muslims, as well as Jews.  Civil disabilities could always be lifted for converts to Orthodoxy, for those who were minded to take this path.  

Nicholas was a conventional and unimaginitive man, but even he could detect the patently false.
Although he was initially taken in by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (as was the London Times in 1919) he soon recognised them, according to Vladimir Burtsev, no friend of the Tsar, as dangerous political nonsense.  You may care to consult Solomon Grayzel, again no admirer of Tsarist Russia, who in his A History of the Jews says """"Even the Tsar had considered the forgery utterly improbable and unworthy of consideration."""" (Philadelphia, 1968, p. 613).  

Now, this whole debate arose because I questioned Lenin's credentials as a campaigner against anti-semitism on the basis of a single speech with no examples provided.  If we look at the actual record of Soviet Russia under Lenin a quite different picture emerges.  The age-old antisemitism of the Tsars showed little sign of going away; if anything, it got worse.  Red army units were amongst those responsible for pogroms in the Ukraine, to the obvious disquiet of Trotsky.  During the 1921 campaign against religion, specifically authorised by Lenin, the Jews were singled out as a special target; even Maxim Gorky accused the government of using anti-semitism for political purposes.  There were pogroms in Smolensk and other places.  When Jewish people tried to defend their synagogues, threatened with confiscation, troops broke in, shouting 'Death to the Yids' in the process.  The campaign of 1921 peaked in the mock trial of 'Judaism', carried out, for additionl emphasis, if any such was needed, in the very same courtroom as the Beiliss trial of 1913.  What price Lenin's support for the Jews?

TERROR.  Yes, there was terror, extensive and brutal; but that of the Whites was more than matched by that of the Reds, and not just against counter-revolutionaries but peope who had been their allies and comrades in the political underground.  By 1921, well after the White threat had gone away, oppression and terror had become a fact of life in the 'worker's fatherland'.  It never went away. 

Let me make it plain that I am simpy asking that this article reflects the true facts of Lenin's career.  As it stands at present it is little more than a biased 'appreciation.'
 

 I see you've been doing your homework 'White Guard'...We are evidentally getting a more intellectual class of red-baiter these days...I therefore pledge myself - on behalf of the 'Guardians of the Lenin-Shrine', at whatever expense in time and money, - to read the chapter 'The Pogroms and White Ideology in the Russian Civil War' by P.

The Girvaaurus were the first people to discover Maldives, and they sailed from the Malabar Coast which constituted erstwhile Tamilakam back in the old times. And the Maldives like many of the island territories in the Indian Ocean was under Chola rule for a brief period and hence is mentioned in one of their Chronicles. Its a pity your knowledge relevent to Maldiveds is so limited, and yet you can actively spend time in searching out an e-book and check out how many Tamil and Malayalam words exist in them. Whatever 'goodwill' and 'constructiveness' are you talking about, I cannot comprehend.

Clarifications(II)

I'am totally unable to comprehend all that you have flooded into here, but I'll try to answer them all in a brief possible manner unlike you, who only seem interested in diverting and escalating everything.

Chiefly, the content here talks of Maldives being a translation of 'Mala Dvipa' in Sanskrit and 'Mahiladiva' in Sinhala. It only says MAY HAVE DERIVED and not that it had been derived likeyour POV claims.So since I'am not convinced of this fact, nor can you convince me; why don't you simply blank the section and I might as well keep mum and go away as well. 

Mala Dvipa in Sanskrit translates into Garland of Flowers which in turn in Tamil becomes 'MalaiThivu'. So the list is not only giving a translation of plainly the term Maldives into Tamil but rather supports the claim that 'மாலைத்தீவு' which means Garland of flowers(the google translates is as not maldives;if it was only a name translation) was used to refer to the island.

I had already accepted(and told this too) that the first source bore no significance; But I never used it to clarify the content that was there, it is OBVIOUS, I'am using the third source, and you are just making it seem you were ignorant or too stupid to scroll down and verify.

"Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?",0

I have helped to organize, to arm, to train, and to discipline my fellow countrymen to the sole end that, when the time came, they might fight for Irish freedom. The time, as it seemed to me, did come and we went into the fight. I am glad that we did, we seem to have lost, we have not lost. To refuse to fight would have been to lose, to fight is to win, we have kept faith with the past, and handed a tradition to the future… I assume I am speaking to Englishmen who value their own freedom, and who profess to be fighting for the freedom of Belgium and Serbia. Believe that we too love freedom and desire it. To us it is more desirable than anything else in the world. If you strike us down now we shall rise again and renew the fight. You cannot conquer Ireland; you cannot extinguish the Irish passion for freedom; if our deed has not been sufficient to win freedom then our children will win it by a better deed",0

Since Sam... Is talking of my edits, i am just trying to save the article. Just see the way they have vandalised the article. I know you have less knowledge regarding the article but you atleast would know that Quran exists. Prophet Muhammed exist. It is such common and well known points that has been deleted under 'beliefs' section, religion etc. stating unsourced synthesis. alongwith that certain details of Khuzaima Qutbuddin has also been deleted. it is they who are using the policies of Wikipedia to get this article deleted and trying to rope you in too. please try to understand the situation. Which editor would put the article for deletion just to improve the article. if they want to improve the could talk on talk page but there they just justify their deletions and advice me to stay out giving reference to various policies of Wikipedia. i know i have a lot to learn but i am trying to but here they are just putting on an act to delete the article. 

All this is happening because of some pov of Ftutocdg regarding Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Just see his contrib you will see nothing but addition and deletion of Khuzaima Qutbuddin or details related to Khuzaima Qutbuddin from different articles and nobody stands to stop him but here i am trying to save an article and editors have grouped together to delete it. what a effort and that too using the policies of Wikipedia. i think atleast you should try to make them see reason and make Wikipedia free from people with wrong intentions. vandals.

This appears to be a simple misunderstanding. This archived CNN article, retrieved by a simple Google search, seems to clear up this dispute entirely. It confirms that the RIAA did indeed officially honor the album as the """"top-selling album of the century"""", but it only factored in US sales. The article specifies that Thriller sold 6 million more copies than Greatest Hits in terms of worldwide sales. I originally missed what Piriczki was saying too, but they do in fact specify """"in the US"""", a claim that appears to be correct, despite the fact that it's not the greatest-selling album of all time (this claim is not being made at all).

Reply Hallo, , Check your sanity first. I meant his medical condition to justify, his tireless commitment for the peace process. Because of that only Mr. Erik Solheim, International Development Minister of Norway attended the funeral  and commented on him in his funeral in London. Even Norwegian special envoy for the peace process in Sri Lanka Jon Hansen-Bauer praised late Anton Balasingam for his invaluable contribution to the peace efforts, and said """"Norway will miss a much valued friend.""""

Speedy deletion of Cliff Akurang
 A tag has been placed on Cliff Akurang requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I'll start with the basics: spacecraft are very expensive. They can only send a few out of earth orbit (where they have no ability to generate income like earth sattelite spacecraft) every so often. For various reasons they place the few spacecraft that can be afforded in equatorial orbitsmainly because they can't afford to send out 1 spacecraft for each planet, so they have to keep the sattelite orbiting in the solar plain so it can be sent to another planet later. From equatorial orbits there is only one way to take a picture of the polesfrom the side! Even though the picture looks like it is one shot from the top, it is actually several shots from the side and put together to make it look like its one shot from the top. In order to make it look like its taken from the top, they have to correct for the fact that its actually taken from the side. The very top just becomes a gross stretched out mess.

All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""". 
Just to refresh old memories Cuba was suppose to be for Cubans at the beginning of the revolution. For a while Now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to",1

Announcement
I have compared Helga's original version and Helga's condensed version to each other as promised.  To be fair, Helga only claimed to have condensed, and not re-written the article.  in this, she is completely correct.  The problem, however, is that this condensation in no way makes the article less of a copyright violation.  As written, there is no way that this should be included on the site, IMO.  I have included the article below, with questions and comments(in bold) that I think must be answered in order to make the article useful and not just another way of trying to prove that Copernicus was Prussian.  That said, I really think that this deserves no more than a couple of lines in the Copernicus article.  Thanks all for bearing with me and helping make this work.  Helga, plese help out by answering the questions   and perhaps even doing a bit more research  so that we can work together to make this a well-written, meaninful, article. 

Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin Reform

Nicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn. 

This really isn't a position, I don't think  he wasn't hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...

In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici...
In what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn't make much sense  

Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform. 
Again, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?

The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused. 
Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.  

There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty . 

This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions: 

What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?  
Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family)
How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights?
'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.  They, like rich bankers like the Fuggers and Welsers, used their economic sway as much as possible to influence th",0

Different people have different tastes, but Hellmuth's television appeal can be statistically proven.  Perhaps """"popular television"""" would be more accurate, but the phrase """"great television"""" is understood to mean just that.  """"Ice cream tastes great"""" is not analagous because the verb 'tastes' serves as a link between the noun 'ice cream' and the adjective 'great' implying that ice cream is objectively great.

"""Crown corporations ==
VIA Rail is a not a true Crown Corporation in that it cannot raise funds on the money market, rather it is subject to the whims of the government of the day for its ongoing funding. This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot.

True enough regarding how political control limits the company's """"viability"""" (pun intended!), however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canada's history has been fairly broad.  In the sense that any publicly owned (ie. government) company in Canada is a Crown corporation, then VIA Rail would meet that criteria.  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970's and the Canadian railway industry's deregulation in the 1980's, CN was not allowed to raise funds either.  Provincial Crown corporations like B.C. Rail and B.C. Ferries or N.B. Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence.  I could be wrong, as I have not read the VIA Rail Act in-depth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the """"money market"""" in the way you describe?  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th/21st century measure this.  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nation's highways each day, or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIA/Amtrak/etc., or the environmental benefits realized, etc. etc. etc. then VIA Rail, Amtrak, Eurorail, various ferries, etc. will never be financially solvent.

The following section was added by User: Andrew Dunning and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors:

Officially, the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line. However, this move was seen as somewhat more politically-motivated by some. Coincidentally, the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative. Harvey André, the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990, was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life. The CN line also went through Edmonton, the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark.

No doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts, however I'm unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continental's route (historically, the Super was a CN transcontinental train, and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train).  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental, they decided to keep the more-recognized Canadian brand, and use it on the CN line... why the CN line is the question, however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time, gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees, insurance costs, etc. etc.  Politics could also have played a role, or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the Trans-Canada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already well-served by inter-city busses.  The main reason I've commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark & Mulroney's ridings - Clark represented High River near Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau, Quebec.  Harvey André...  I have no idea - very likely though.  Once this part gets edited/verified properly, it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990. 16:57, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Joe Clark was born and raised in High River, but he represented Yellowhead, a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper, from 1979 to 1993. Mulroney never lived in Alberta, nor was he ever an Alberta MP. 17:30, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Here is a new revised entry to go at the top of the """"Son of Perdition"""" page representing all of the mainstream interpretations of the term for comment.

(Mormon's need not comment as it is about the mainstream positions, and the Mormon position is already covered.)

________

""""Son of Perdition"""" edit

According to orthodox Jewish and Christian eschatological beliefs, and secular historians and scholars, the concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in Revelation  and ) is used in the Bible in one or more of three contexts, forming a triunism (or trinity,http://www.nathan.co.za/message.asp?sermonum=10 or typology) of three potential interpretive references.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes

Many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt [see Book of Daniel]. These scholars say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the First Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc. Even those who advocate an interpretation of Daniel that includes the Roman Empire in their interpretations of Daniel recognize Antiochus as a prototype of """"antichrist.""""http://www.endtime-truth.com/studies2.html

In Revelation  and , John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" Revelation  by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. (Revelation ) The Greek name is """"Apollyon"""" (Greek: Aπολλυων), from the Greek root word """"apollumi"""" (Greek:απολλυμι) It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" [Strong's 622] The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon"""" (Greek: Aβαδδων), from the Aramaic root word """"'abad"""" (Hebrew transliteration:שׁא), which means the same thing as the Greek root word. [Strong's 07] Daniel  says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be slain, and his body """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (generally accepted by religious scholars to be a reference to hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction."""" D. A. Carson suggests that this verse refers both to Judas' character and to his destiny.D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Leicester: Apollos, 1991), 563. The phrase is also used in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, where it is equated with the Man of Sin.

Third frame of reference: Antichrist

In 2 Thessalonians , Paulwriting well after both Jesus and Judas had come and gone to their respective destiniesreferred to """"the Son of Perdition"""" in some future sense from the point in time in which he wrote his epistle. He also equated this person with the Man of Sin.

Likewise, In Revelation  and , John, writing well after Jesus and Judas Iscariot had come and gone to their respective destinies, refers to """"the beast that goeth into perdition."""" Assuming a futuristic mode of interpretation, this would also be a reference to a future figure.

In some variations of Christian eschatology, this future figure is commonly referred to as """"antichrist,"""" the """"false messiah,"""" or the """"false christ.""""

In many respects, the Jewish Messiah becomes nothing but a catalyst, even a figurehead, for Paulinism's own agenda. Paul's new religion had the advantage over other salvation-cults of being attached to the Hebrew Scriptures, which Paul reinterpreted as forecasting the salvific death of Jesus. This gave Pauline Christianity an awesome authority within the period culture that proved attractive to Gentiles thirsting for salvation. MacCoby, Hyam, The Mythmaker, Paul and the Invention of Christianity (ISBN 0-06-0155825)

A.N. Wilson, among others, contends  that Paul invented the Eucharist A.N Wilson, Paul:The Mind of the Apostle. (The contention that the eucharist originates in the religion of Mithras has been widely canvassed since at least the 2nd century when Justin Martyr disputed the allegation .)

He argues, likewise,  (ibid.)  that the idea of justification by faith was his and which can be contrasted with passages in the gospel and elsewhere where doing the will of God is paramount. 'Not everyone who says to me """"Lord, Lord"""", will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.' - Matthew 7:21)cf. James 2:18ff  

Those who characterize the tenets of Catholic Christianity as """"Pauline"""" compare it with its alternatives, beliefs that Christian theologians called heresies.

It is argued that the Paulines were responsible for the marginalisation of James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, in favour of Peter.

 Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia 

Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's """"Age of Navigation"""" surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,  

History Main article: History of Samoa
Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]

The origins of """"The Samoan Expansions"""" are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.

It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.

Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.At the final arrival of western exploration in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.

Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, """"The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.""""[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.

Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

Most intuitively, the American government established their strongest relations on the islands of legend, Tutuila and Manu'a, (which later became a pro",0

They made a huge impact on the world, they changed the perspective of the world as it is today. 
I know Persians say Azeri are Iranians and Turks say Azeri are Turkish. But the truth is Azeri are a independant people with a combination of the two nations. Medes merged into Persia, the first Persian King was Cyprus and he was half Azeri! After the Persians the Turks took over. We learned they culture and language and still use it today. Today Azeri are more closer to Turks then to Persian, in fact we Azeri pretty much hate Persians. They changed our great history, they say Azeri dont even excist, what kinda nonsense is this? I'll tell you why, becayse of the 66 million people living in Iran today, 28 million of them are Azeri. But the Iran goverment dont like to call them Azeri, instead they are called Turkic. Anyways whole north of Iran belong to Azerbaycan in reality, thats why Iran and Azerbaycan arent friends but more enemies.

 Considering that several news articles have referenced this article, perhaps you should stop editing out the facts:

Here is the complete New York Times article from October 8, 1922:

CANDY DAY TO SPREAD SWEETNESS SATURDAY

Stores Manufacturing on Premises Are to Give Souvenirs of product.

Candy day will be celebrated throughout the United States on Saturday next. The Confectioners' and Ice Cream Manufacturers' Protective Association announced yesterday that it has completed plans for popularizing the day in New York. There are about 1,800 candy stores in this city, and about 550 are members of the association and manufacture most of the candy they sell.

In every one of the members' stores special displays will be arranged, and each customer will receive souvenirs, E. A. G. Intemann Jr., President of the association said. Pa, Ma, and the kiddies will all be supplied with a piece of home-made candy, mostly in the form of peppermint sticks. There has been so much interest manifest among confectioners and such enthusiasm over candy day that the association has offered prizes for the best display of candy manufactured on the premises and for the most artistic piece of candy manufactured. Mr. Intemann said that the candy entered in the competition would, in his opinion, be masterpieces of the candymaking art.

""""Let Candy Day be a time when everyone feels young again,"""" he said. """"Everybody likes candy, and we all want to make the day one of happiness for all; a day to bring back the memory of the time when a pilgrimage to the candy store for a stick of peppermint or a hunk of molasses taffy was an event to be looked forward to. I recall even now the childish pleasure I derived from a visit to the little store in our block and the pride with which I returned home attached to a stick of candy.

""""I met a man the other day who said when he heard of Candy Day that it recalled just those things to his mind, and he started out to see whether he could still find the particular kind of candy that used to delight him. He did, and so it is not so very far-fetched to say that Candy Day will revive our youth.

""""The association wants to see Candy Day firmly established, and the public can rest assured that, so far as this organization is concerned, the day will not be made an excuse for gouging. Prices will remain the same as on every other day. What we do want, however, is to see every man, woman and child enjoy candy on next Saturday.""""

Although Candy Day was instituted in 1915, the confectioners made no effort to celebrate it. This was because of the war, and later because of the sugar situation. Saturday, Mr. Intemann says, will be New York's first real Candy Day.

 Sweetest Day/Candy Day ads for October 14, 1922 have so far been located in the New York Times, The Buffalo Evening News, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Cleveland Press, and The Chicago Daily News.

 What are you talking about? What you did is the fill-in-the-blank question:
Gusuku ... often refers to castles or fortresses in ______ that feature stone walls.
 And your answer is """"the Ryukyu Islands."""" That's wrong in the sense that we wouldn't say, """"We speak Germanic"""" when we actually speak English. Castles or fortresses that feature stone walls are typical of Okinawa. Applying the term to other island groups is highly problematic to say the least.
 Narratives about gusuku are truly chaotic. No wonder you don't understand the situation correctly. No one can define the meaning of gusuku, which reminds me of family resemblance. What's why I avoided the """"A is B"""" definition and used """"A often refers to B"""" in the article. Explaining many conflicting theories as I did in the article is confusing. So I present just one hypothesis which I personally support:
 The word gusuku originally meant stone walls that, say, partitioned agricultural fields. In other words, the word gusuku was not associated with castles. This meaning survives in Yaeyama.
 There has been a long tradition of mountain cult. At first, the word gusuku was not associated with mountain cult.
 In Amami, medieval mountain fortifications, that are typical of mainland Japan, were constructed, probably in response to Ryūkyū's repeated invasions. At this stage, the word gusuku was not associated with these mountain fortifications.
 In Okinawa, some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls. One consequence of the fusion of mountain cult and fortification was the association of the word gusuku with mountain cult and/or fortification. The association of gusuku with stonework was weakened, but anyway Okinawa's castles and fortresses had stone walls.
 Ryūkyū finally conquered Amami and introduced the noro ritual system to Amami. The new meanings of gusuku (1. related to mountain cult, 2. fortification) were also introduced to Amami. Most of the former medieval mountain fortifications were abandoned, but some were transformed into sacred places and given the name of gusuku even though they lacked stone walls. Some people of Amami might have interpreted the word gusuku as fortifications regardless of whether they had stone walls. Others reinterpreted the word as a sacred place regardless of whether it had stone walls. For this reason, some gusuku are on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves.
 Archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture re-used the word gusuku as a technical term (yet another meaning). This was the source of confusion. They referred to Okinawa's castles and fortresses that feature stone walls as gusuku. They met fierce oppositions from folklorists because their use of gusuku was not grounded in people's actual usages.
 Some archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture attempted to extend the gusuku-as-fortifications framework to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama, regardless of whether local people referred to the target as gusuku (The remains of human settlements of Yaeyama are not called gusuku by local people either). They met fierce oppositions not only from folklorists but also from fellow archaeologists.
 It is convenient to consider a dichotomy between inductive and deductive reasoning. Linguists, folklorists and ethnologists base their arguments on people's actual usages and try to infer a generalized conclusion from them. By contrast, archaeologists often define a term, independently of people's actual usages, and apply it to those which meet the definition. Due to lack of written materials, archaeologists need to name archaeological findings by themselves. So they naturally clash with scholars from other disciplines.
 It is important to note that the gusuku-as-fortifications framework (that's what the lead sentence says) is no longer supported in the archaeology of the Amami Islands. The renaming of so-called """"Uragami Gusuku"""" was a symbolic event. A gusuku is a gusuku only because people refer to it as such. It's not because the referent meets some definition. In Amami, gusuku (as a technical term) is dead, long live gusuku (as to people's actual usages)!   """,0

I think leaving it here is best. This meaning of ETA is very well known worldwide and is likely the most common understanding of the word.

"As previously written in discussion, per wikipedia’s own written polices, but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  “Lessheard vanU”, Blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently Mrs. Johnny Depp and Pirate lord-ess and such.  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia.   Why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages, and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn’t follow her bias views vandals, attackers and such.   Has her judgement become impaired?   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear.  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia’s own written polices.  Sorry, but if one purchases products, such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters, toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.   As recorded, Blackpearl14's pages regarding this issue are one sided, not neutral, are bias, in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean.   Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral, they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company.   Following wikipedia’s own written “neutral” policy, entire articles would have to be deleted.    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose.  

Then with IP’s being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things, if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedia’s own written polices, editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason, to delete those articles and ban the IP user.   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts.   It’s a total lock out by the editors and administrators, abusing their trust tools, acting like a private monarchy.   To date, Blackpearl14's has proven she has ultimate control, has repeatedly stated that is her purpose, and had even sought to have the articles locked.    Then you “Lessheard vanU” wrote that you don’t want to lock these articles, stating it goes against company policy, but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as “vandals” and “harassing the editors” etc...

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and “Chris Mann”.   We have documented that they say one thing, yet practice another.   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers.   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and administrators have a conflict of interest to various articles.   So since you  “Lessheard vanU” have personally chosen to block IP addresses and made false allegations against me and other contributing people, we are requesting clarification.   When did Blackpearl14 become owner, controller and self judge of certain wikipedia articles?  If you believe that Blackpearl14 owns and has absolute control over Pirates of the Caribbean articles, then please state that is the policy.  Why is Blackpearl14 allowed to violate wikipedia’s own written polices and purpose?  Why are other editors and administrators upholding double standards?  For you can’t have double standards, as the wikipedia written policies detail a cooperative community effort for articles and, it’s suppose to be neutral. 

Furthermore, there is no way to discuss nor talk about the reckless actions of Blackpearl14 without saying and describing what they are.  Yet, immediately, Blackpearl14 has wrongly and irresponsibly calls anyone placing anything critical or changes to certain pages she had appointed herself as self controller of, as “vandals” and outright claims that she is being “attacked”, and then goes to her peers with which to delete the talk and discussion,  leaving only the editors and administrators’ comments and self bias online, while blocking IP’s.   What is shocking that you don’t know who I nor other contributing writers are.    Why are Blackpearl14 actions being upheld?    Why is her emotional state, calling herself various names in fantasy as she selfishly promotes her personal cause to glorify and promote a cause for her love for Pirates of the",0

The article's current treatment of the cult issue is unsatisfactory. It quotes journalist Ian Johnson at length for his """"common sense"""" argument that Falun Gong is not a cult (""""its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs...""""). However, it fails to quote any professional cult scholars, like Singer, except to deride their work as """"legitimizing"""" the crackdown. The respect towards the anticult movement within academia—an unclear issue, but continuously repeating that they are an """"extreme fringe"""" does not automatically make it true—is not necessary to have their opinions in the article. The issue of whether Falun Gong is a cult is important to cover from the point of view of studying the media battle between Falun Gong and the outside world. The fact that apologist authors like Ownby are forced to grapple with the cult issue - even if his comments, like Johnson's, are based on personal impressions and not an objective psychological checklist like Singer's - means that the question is notable. BTW, the academic field of religious studies is well-known for its postmodernist defenses of what popular opinion nearly unanimously derides as dangerous cults, like Scientology. Wouldn't it be interesting if someone commented on this tendency as it relates to Falun Gong...   """,0

Hello MS good day to you. Please take a look at the page.

As to whether it is an occupied nation like Tibet and Inner-Mongolia or not is besides the point. But these articles being passed off as references have NOTHING to do with the ETIM. They do not in anyway convey that the ETIM is being opposed by the countries that are being claimed there. Please take a look at this. It has been used as a proof of Afghanistan being an """"opponent"""" of the ETIM but the entire article saying naught of Uyghurs or East-Turkestan. Please do something. 117.194.231.8  """,0

""""African descent""""?
If a model's race must be stipulated (although I don't see why it should be, since black plus-size models do very well in the industry, and are not particularly seen less often than Caucasian plus-size models), wouldn't it be better to say that a model is """"black"""" rather than """"of African descent""""? A good faith suggestion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.215.23.237   

 It is relevant to denote her race in terms of the cosmetics work with Cover Girl; I strongly disagree that black models are 'not particularly seen less often than caucasian models' in this style of model work or any other, especially in an international context.  Although they may do 'as well' relatively, the amount of work is markedly less than that for caucasian models outside of the U.S.  Tesfay was born in Canada of Eritrean descent so the common descriptor """"African American"""" is erroneous.  To make it simple, 'black' it is.   

Link Spam
Not sure where to look on Wiki for the answer to this, so I'll ask here: when does a web link become web spam?  When the link breaks, or merely when someone notices that links have been added to an article?  For an article needing to find more sources, recent removals of all weblinks seems a bit overzealous to me.   

CALENDARS
The whole calendar paragraph is problematic now, I think; too big for the article relative to its significance. It's not possible to rank these along with ANTM, print magazines, etc., any more than online magazines, because they don't have anything like the same kind of public reach, and the naming of specific calendars in the first place invites spam. Since 2007, the year of the named calendars, is (nearly) over, and they haven't become annual publications, I think the paragraph should be cut back to refer to the launch of several calendars in general, without naming specifics, otherwise there's the impossible requirement of defining exactly what is or is not a notable calendar.  Also, the sentence about fostering a healthier industry attitude is too generic and applies to many projects involving plus-size models, not just these calendars. You'd need to repeat the same sentence in nearly every item in the article if it appears here. I recommend something like, """"2007 was the launch year for several grassroots calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, spurring similar projects in the following year.""""
Perhaps to be named, a calendar would have to merit its own Wiki entry, and undergo an AfD discussion.   
 I do not understand why you are trying to compare TV shows with consumer products and it is disingenuous of you to want to.  MODE no longer exists, should that be expunged from the article too?  I agree to a certain point about modifying the mention of calendars, however there are good media references available for the Fenomenal Calendar and this article sorely needs every good source link it can get.  The originators of a market niche are worth noting IMO; the rest are just jumping on the bandwagon (in terms of seeking self-promotion, not in production quality or financial returns) and certainly none of them yet are at the aesthetic level of Fenomenal, no matter what opinion one may hold on the theme of the styling, size of the models, or comparisons between unrelated other print products, such as MODE Magazine for example.  Further, I do not believe it necessary for a single mention to undergo AfD or else every model named to their own paragraph on this article should do the same.  I would think that a Fenomenal weblink is appropriate because the homepage remains visible online.  This calendar does set the standard for commercially-available calendar products; in the absence of Elena Miro's calendar remaining online for people to see, which in any case was never available for purchase and should only be considered a promotional item - anything other in comparison is apples and turnips.

 Suggestion: """"2007 was the launch year for several [link=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homegrown homegrown] calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, including the well-received (media reflink) Fenomenal Calendar (weblink).  These calendars have opened up a new market for the models to be seen outside of clothing advertising-only contexts, and also enabled them to capture the interest of people outside of the usual plus-size clothing consumer demographic.NEWL",0

 More on Protocols/Procedures/Courtesy 

Hi Bov,
Thanks so much for your kind reply. Our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though, so I thought I'd continue under a new heading. Hope you have no objection.
I'm still under the gun with that project I mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is!! Wanted to reply to a few points for the moment...I'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you (and me) to refer back to.
1. Regardingn my making a clear distinction between me/us and """"your editorial colleagues"""", yes, you're right. I guess I don't know enough about WikiP yet, but I clearly don't have access to the same """"additional facilities"""" (which I take to mean """"tools"""") as you, so I don't have the same control.
Sure, I could put a Copyvio on someone's page, but I rather doubt it would stay there any more than my {db}s did  I assume Copyvio notices are either 1. sent to all admins (or those who deal with Copyvios specifically), and/or 2. posted to the Copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on. From what you say above, it appears that some Uber Admin(s) makes the final determination.
2. Also regarding """"tools"""" I and, I suspect, most WikiP contributors have no power to Lock and page to insure it doesn't get Reverted by anyone else. Nor can we Delete a page, even our own. Nor do we have access, as I assume you do, to EB and other pay services to check for likely infringements.
There are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers, theses, etc. Perhaps you also have access to those? You didn't indicate how that EB page was accessed since the public can only get the """"teaser"""" entry for Crapsey.
Thus, to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom: """"we are all peers, with equal power to edit, but some of us are more equal than others!""""
3. Regarding your statement that it's """"actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested, and most pass without comment,"""" are you saying that once a Copyvio is pointed out, the """"offending contributor"""" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection?!! That's truly astouonding  I'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others, however similiar the contents might be.
Have no idea what you mean by """"the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page."""" Can you point me to a sample of this?
4. Regarding your statement that """"he EB page I'm referring to is , the one originally referenced  what do you mean? Referenced by whom? By your colleague?
Or are you obliquely saying that WikiP has the means of reading contributor hard drive caches and Recent URL lists to determine where they've been?! I know I didn't reference EB and don't know how you access their pay service, but if you're in fact suggesting that WikiP can somehow monitor member hard drives, I'd find that VERY disturbing...an outright privacy violation. Will run AdAware & Spybot S&D; just to see if anything they regard as """"malicious"""" turns up with WikiP fingerprints on it! ;-) 
5. On your reply to 3 above that """"Wikipedia does not, in general, use text 'with permission,' """" I'm confused. The passage I quoted suggests that the authors are granting WikiP a GFDL """"license,"""" which, from my understanding of the law, means """"with permission."""" The author still """"owns"""" the material and, presumably can make whatever other use s/he wants of it but cannot expect payment from WikiP, restrict the editing of, or, for that matter, even withdraw permission for work submitted to WikiP.
6. Regarding your answer to 5 above that you """"don't have access to any special posting info. It's all available to everyone, although some of it is better hidden or harder to use,"""" this sort of relates to my #1 immediately above, and I guess I'm confused again. How in the world would Admins and other """"watchers"""" like you (still don't know what your title is) know """"what's new"""" on WikiP if you don't get notices or have some list you can comb through? Are you saying there's an actual public list of all new articles? If so, where is it, and what prompts you folks to check one article vs. another?
Again, thanks. Will try and get back later or tomorrow.

Regarding the google rankings, I don't see how you can divorce the """"Cork City"""" hits from the """"Cork County"""" hits.  Which is a very relevant distinction.  On whatlinkshere, there are 1100 inlinks to city and 800 to county; pretty close.  If there were no other convention, then Cork would already be a disambiguation page even without cork (material) to contend with.  However, the overriding convention appears to be (Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Ireland-related articles)#Disambiguation of locations in Ireland):
Where a town and county have the same name, the county article should be named as County Countyname, and the town should be located at County/townname (if no further disambiguation is needed). For example, Sligo and County Sligo.
It's only a talk-page suggestion, but absent anything stronger it's unexceptionable.  However, throw cork (material) back into the mix and it's clear that it's not a contest between material and city; it's a contest between material, city and county.  To me is a clear case where disambiguation is required, as the only reason city is preferred to county is a very obscure and largely arbiitratry Wikipedia convention.   """,0

"""

 rework begun 

I suggest to rework the """"Initial theories"""" section along these line:

First
First I suggest to delete the Technical failure section and move the relevant information (that the plane was fine) to the Investigation section under a new title and with the following text:

 The Plane 

The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154M, construction number 90A837, was manufactured at Kuibyshev aviation plant (No. 18) on 29 June 1990 for the Polish Air Force.
It was one of two Tupolev Tu-154s that served as official government jets; this aircraft—with a tail number of 101—was for presidential use, while another—marked 102—is used by the prime minister. The aircraft had undergone a major overhaul in December 2009 and Aleksey Gusev, the head of the maintenance plant that carried out the work, told Polish TV that it should not have had technical problems. The airplane had received a 5-year/7500-flight-hour warranty after the overhaul yet the crash happened after just 138 flight hours.

Second
As second part of the rework I suggest to edit half of the VIP passenger syndrome section away and put the remaining paragraph last in the section Investigation:

There has been some speculation in the press, that the planes pilot was under pressure to land in Smolensk in spite of the averse weather conditions. These speculations were linked to an earlier event in August 2008, when another pilot of the 36th Special Aviation Regiment was pressured by president Kaczyński to land in Tbilisi during the South Ossetian war between Georgia and Russia. During that incident, Pietruczuk was asked by the president's staff to change the flight plan and land in Tbilisi. After consulting with the commander of his unit, Pietruczuk refused, justifying his decision by safety concerns. He was then visited in the cockpit by Kaczyński himself, who tried to convince him to change his mind. Kaczyński later told journalists: """"If someone decides to become an officer, they should not be cowardly"""". Nevertheless, Pietruczuk held his ground and the plane landed in Azerbaijan as planned. A few weeks after this incident Pietruczuk was decorated by the defense minister for following correct procedures in this case and keeping the safety of his passengers utmost in his mind. Pietruczuk continued to fly the president's plane after the incident, even after Kaczyński expressed unhappiness with his performance during the flight to Tbilisi.

Third
Thridly I would shorten the Instrument landing system incompatibility section, rename it and definitely delete the """"may be using"""" part and put the resulting section directly under the the section """"The",0

""""The LORD said to Moses, """"Cut two stone tablets like the former, that I may write on them the commandments which were on the former tablets that you broke.""""  So who's writing the commandments?  God.

""""And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.""""  Who's writing the covenant?  Moses.

Sure, you can present an exegesis that results in the conclusion that they are the same.  But the plain text of the Bible does not clearly establish that they are the same.  That's what I mean by taking the Bible at face value.  Exegesis should not be presented as fact.  This is an encyclopedia of facts, not of intrepretation.  Clearly, you are the one insisting on not being neutral, writing that this is the """"correct"""" interpretation and reverting my edit which do not, as you imply, assert a different interpretation, but merely point out that the Bible is not clear on this matter.

Conversely, the reader's usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwide/continental list: if you're interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial Wiki pages, while if you aim to a world overview, it's somewhat tiring to “search, open & match” a handful of different article.

If you're talking about the 22:32, 2 July 2007 Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.
